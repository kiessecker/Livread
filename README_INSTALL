How to set up
=============

1. Upload to web directory
2. Create database + user and populate mysqldump.sql
	$ mysql -uUsername -pPassword DatabaseName<mysqldump.sql
2. edit config/config.php to fit to paths and database user

	I have set up a demo user with data 
	username=kiessecker, password=hello

3. install wine and calibre ebook management
if necessary use xvfb-run to get a virtual framebuffer to run ebook-convert.exe from apache
or use calibre from linux repository - but probably you need a virtual framebuffer either to convert?? I don't know



4. modify includes/uploadbook.php and  
5. modify includes/functions.php and especially the function livreadEbookConvert2Any
	so that apache initiates conversion of uploaded book
	for this a script is generated and run

	Modify or do it better

6. Install sapi and tts voices within wine and use sapi2wav.exe to convert on-the-fly read-out 
Or you could use cepstral voices with the linux commandline tools


6. test and debug
