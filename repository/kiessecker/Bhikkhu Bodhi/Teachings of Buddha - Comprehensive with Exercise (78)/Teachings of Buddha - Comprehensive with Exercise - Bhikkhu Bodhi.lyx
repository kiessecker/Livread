\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Life means suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To live means to suffer, because the human nature is not perfect and neither
 is the world we live in.
 During our lifetime, we inevitably have to endure physical suffering such
 as pain, sickness, injury, tiredness, old age, and eventually death; and
 we have to endure psychological suffering like sadness, fear, frustration,
 disappointment, and depression.
 Although there are different degrees of suffering and there are also positive
 experiences in life that we perceive as the opposite of suffering, such
 as ease, comfort and happiness, life in its totality is imperfect and incomplet
e, because our world is subject to impermanence.
 This means we are never able to keep permanently what we strive for, and
 just as happy moments pass by, we ourselves and our loved ones will pass
 away one day, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The origin of suffering is attachment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance
 thereof.
 Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround
 us, but also ideas, and -in a greater sense- all objects of our perception.
 Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermane
nt things.
 The reasons for suffering are desire, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth
 and prestige, striving for fame and popularity, or in short: craving and
 clinging.
 Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable,
 thus suffering will necessarily follow.
 Objects of attachment also include the idea of a "self" which is a delusion,
 because there is no abiding self.
 What we call "self" is just an imagined entity, and we are merely a part
 of the ceaseless becoming of the universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 The cessation of suffering is attainable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cessation of suffering can be attained through nirodha.
 Nirodha means the unmaking of sensual craving and conceptual attachment.
 The third noble truth expresses the idea that suffering can be ended by
 attaining dispassion.
 Nirodha extinguishes all forms of clinging and attachment.
 This means that suffering can be overcome through human activity, simply
 by removing the cause of suffering.
 Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately
 results in the state of Nirvana.
 Nirvana means freedom from all worries, troubles, complexes, fabrications
 and ideas.
 Nirvana is not comprehensible for those who have not attained it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 The path to the cessation of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a path to the end of suffering - a gradual path of self-improvement,
 which is described more detailed in the Eightfold Path.
 It is the middle way between the two extremes of excessive self-indulgence
 (hedonism) and excessive self-mortification (asceticism); and it leads
 to the end of the cycle of rebirth.
 The latter quality discerns it from other paths which are merely "wandering
 on the wheel of becoming", because these do not have a final object.
 The path to the end of suffering can extend over many lifetimes, throughout
 which every individual rebirth is subject to karmic conditioning.
 Craving, ignorance, delusions, and its effects will disappear gradually,
 as progress is made on the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Eight-Fold Path
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Eight-Fold Path is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths - the first of
 the Buddha's teachings.
 All the teachings flow from this foundation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Four Noble Truths are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The Noble Truth of the reality of Dukkha as part of conditioned existence.Dukkha
 is a multi-faceted word.
 Its literal meaning is "that which is difficult to bear".
 It can mean suffering, stress, pain, anguish, affliction or unsatisfactoriness.
 Each of the English words is either too strong or too weak in their meaning
 to be a universally successful translation.
 Dukkha can be gross or very subtle.
 From extreme physical and mental pain and torment to subtle inner conflicts
 and existential malaise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The Noble Truth that Dukkha has a causal arising.This cause is defined as
 grasping and clinging or aversion.
 On one hand it is trying to control anything and everything by grabbing
 onto or trying to pin them down, On the other hand it is control by pushing
 away or pushing down and running away or flinching away from things.
 It is the process of identification through which we try to make internal
 and external things and experiences into "me and mine" or wholly '"other"
 than Me.
 This flies in the face of the three signs of existence - Anicca, Dukkha.
 Anatta - Impermanence.
 Stress or Suffering and No-Self.
 Because all conditioned existence is impermanent it gives rise to Dukkha,
 and this means that in conditioned existence there is no unchanging and
 permanent Self.
 There is nothing to grasp onto and also in reality, nothing or no 'one'
 to do the grasping! We grab onto or try to push away ever changing dynamic
 processes.
 These attempts to control, limit us to little definitions of who we are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 The Noble Truth of the end of Dukkha, which is Nirvana or Nibbana.
 Beyond grasping and control and conditional existence is Nirvana.
 "The mind like fire unbound." The realisation of Nirvana is supreme Bodhi
 or Awakening.
 It is waking up to the true nature of reality.
 It is waking up to our true nature.
 Buddha Nature.
 The Pali Canon of Theravada, the foundational Buddhist teachings, says
 little about Nirvana, using terms like the Unconditioned the Deathless,
 and the Unborn.
 Mahayana teachings speak more about the qualities of Nirvana and use terms
 like, True Nature, Original Mind, Infinite light and Infinite life.
 Beyond space and time.
 Nirvana defies definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nirvana literally means "unbound' as in "Mind like fire unbound".
 This beautiful image is of a flame burning by itself.
 Just the flame, not something burning and giving off a flame.
 Picture a flame burning on a wick or stick, it seems to hover around or
 just above the thing burning.
 The flame seems to be independent of the thing burning but it clings to
 the stick and is bound to it.
 This sense of the flame being unbound has often been misunderstood to mean
 the flame is extinguished or blown out.
 This is completely opposite to the meaning of the symbol.
 The flame "burns" and gives light but is no longer bound to any combustible
 material.
 The flame is not blown out - the clinging and the clung to is extinguished.
 The flame of our true nature, which is awakening, burns independently.
 Ultimately Nirvana is beyond conception and intellectual understanding.
 Full understanding only comes through direct experience of this "state'
 which is beyond the limitations and definitions of space and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 The Noble Truth of the Path that leads to Awakening.
 The path is a paradox.
 It is a conditioned thing that is said to help you to the unconditioned.
 Awakening is not "made" by anything: it is not a product of anything including
 the Buddha's teachings.
 Awakening, your true nature is already always present.
 We are just not awake to this reality.
 Clinging to limitation, and attempts to control the ceaseless flow of phenomena
 and process obscures our true nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path is a processto help you remove or move beyond the conditioned responses
 that obscure your true nature.
 In this sense the Path is ultimately about unlearning rather than learning
 - another paradox.
 We learn so we can unlearn and uncover.
 The Buddha called his teaching a Raft.
 To cross a turbulent river we may need to build a raft.
 When built, we single-mindedly and with great energy make our way across.
 Once across we don't need to cart the raft around with us.
 In other words don't cling to anything including the teachings.
 However, make sure you use them before you let them go.
 It's no use knowing everything about the raft and not getting on.
 The teachings are tools not dogma.
 The teachings are Upaya, which means skillful means or expedient method.
 It is fingers pointing at the moon - don't confuse the finger for the moon.

\begin_layout Standard
The Path
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 * Samma-Ditthi — Complete or Perfect Vision, also translated as right view
 or understanding.
 Vision of the nature of reality and the path of transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Samma-Sankappa — Perfected Emotion or Aspiration, also translated as right
 thought or attitude.
 Liberating emotional intelligence in your life and acting from love and
 compassion.
 An informed heart and feeling mind that are free to practice letting go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Samma-Vaca — Perfected or whole Speech.
 Also called right speech.
 Clear, truthful, uplifting and non-harmful communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Samma-Kammanta — Integral Action.
 Also called right action.
 An ethical foundation for life based on the principle of non-exploitation
 of oneself and others.
 The five precepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Samma-Ajiva — Proper Livelihood.
 Also called right livelihood.
 This is a livelihood based on correct action the ethical principal of non-explo
itation.
 The basis of an Ideal society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Samma-Vayama— Complete or Full Effort, Energy or Vitality.
 Also called right effort or diligence.
 Consciously directing our life energy to the transformative path of creative
 and healing action that fosters wholeness.
 Conscious evolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Samma-Sati— Complete or Thorough Awareness.
 Also called "right mindfulness".
 Developing awareness, "if you hold yourself dear watch yourself well".
 Levels of Awareness and mindfulness - of things, oneself, feelings, thought,
 people and Reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 Samma-Samadhi — Full, Integral or Holistic Samadhi.This is often translated
 as concentration, meditation, absorption or one-pointedness of mind.
 None of these translations is adequate.
 Samadhi literally means to be fixed, absorbed in or established at one
 point, thus the first level of meaning is concentration when the mind is
 fixed on a single object.
 The second level of meaning goes further and represents the establishment,
 not just of the mind, but also of the whole being in various levels or
 modes of consciousness and awareness.
 This is Samadhi in the sense of enlightenment or Buddhahood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The word Samma means 'proper', 'whole', 'thorough', 'integral', 'complete',
 and 'perfect' - related to English 'summit' - It does not necessarily mean
 'right', as opposed to 'wrong'.
 However it is often translated as "right" which can send a less than accurate
 message.
 For instance the opposite of 'Right Awareness' is not necessarily 'Wrong
 Awareness'.
 It may simply be incomplete.
 Use of the word 'right' may make for a neat or consistent list of qualities
 in translations.
 The down side is that it can give the impression that the Path is a narrow
 and moralistic approach to the spiritual life.
 I use variant interpretations so you consider the depth of meanings.
 What do these things mean in your life right now?

 Discourse to Ganaka-Moggallana (Majjhima Nikaya 107)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus I have heard: At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the
 palace of Migara's mother in the Eastern Monastery.
 Then the brahman Ganaka-Moggallana approached the Lord; having approached
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord; having conversed in a friendly and
 courteous way, he sat down at a respectful distance.
 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Ganaka-Moggallana the
 brahman spoke thus to the Lord: "Just as, good Gotama, in this palace of
 Migara's mother there can be seen a gradual training, a gradual doing,
 a gradual practice, that is to say as far as the last flight of stairs,1
 so, too, good Gotama, for these brahmans there can be seen a gradual training,
 a gradual doing, a gradual practice, that is to say in the study [of the
 Vedas];2 so too, good Gotama, for these archers there can be seen a gradual...
 practice, that is to say in archery; so too, good Gotama, for us whose
 livelihood is calculation3 there can be seen a gradual training, a gradual
 practice, that is to say in accountancy.
 For when we get a pupil, good Gotama, we first of all make him calculate:
 'One one, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven
 sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens,' and we, good Gotama, also
 make him calculate a hundred.
 Is it not possible, good Gotama, to lay down a similar gradual training,
 gradual doing, gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is possible, brahman, to lay down a gradual training, a gradual doing,
 a gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline, Brahman, even
 a skilled trainer of horses, having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred first
 of all gets it used to the training in respect of wearing the bit.
 Then he gets it used to further training — even so brahman, the Tathagata,
 having taken on a man to be tamed, first of all disciplines him thus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Morality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"'Come you, monk, be of moral habit, live controlled by the control of the
 Obligations, endowed with [right] behavior and posture, seeing peril in
 the slightest fault and, undertaking them, train yourself in the rules
 of training.' As soon, brahman, as the monk is of moral habit, controlled
 by the control of the Obligations, endowed with [right] behavior and posture;
 seeing peril in the slightest fault and, undertaking them, trains himself
 in the rules of training, the Tathagata disciplines him further saying:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sense-control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"'Come you monk, be guarded as to the doors of the sense-organs; having
 seen a material shape with the eye, do not be entranced with the general
 appearance, do not be entranced with the detail; for if one dwells with
 the organ of sight uncontrolled, covetousness and dejection, evil, unskillful
 states of mind, may flow in.
 So fare along controlling it, guard the organ of sight, achieve control
 over the organ of sight.
 Having heard a sound with the ear...
 Having smelt a smell with the nose...
 Having savored a taste with the tongue...
 Having felt a touch with the body...
 Having cognized a mental state with the mind, do not be entranced with
 the detail.
 For if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled, covetousness and
 dejection, evil, unskillful states of mind, may flow in.
 So fare along controlling it; guard the organ of mind, achieve control
 over the organ of mind.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moderation in eating
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As soon, brahman, as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the sense-organs,
 the Tathagata disciplines him further, saying: 'Come you, monk, be moderate
 in eating; you should take food reflecting carefully, not for fun or indulgence
 or personal charm or beautification, but taking just enough for maintaining
 this body and keeping it going, for keeping it unharmed, for furthering
 the Brahma-faring,4 with the thought: Thus will I crush out an old feeling,
 and I will not allow a new feeling to arise, and then there will be for
 me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in comfort.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vigilance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As soon, brahman, as a monk is moderate in eating, the Tathagata disciplines
 him further, saying: 'Come you, monk, dwell intent on vigilance; during
 the day while pacing up and down, while sitting down, cleanse the mind
 of obstructive mental states; during the middle watch of the night, lie
 down on the right side in the lion posture, foot resting on foot, mindful,
 clearly conscious, reflecting on the thought of getting up again; during
 the last watch of the night, when you have arisen, while pacing up and
 down, while sitting down, cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness and clear consciousness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As soon, brahman, as a monk is intent on vigilance, the Tathagata disciplines
 him further, saying: 'Come you, monk, be possessed of mindfulness and clear
 consciousness, acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching
 or departing, acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead
 or looking round, acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending
 in or stretching out [the arms], acting with clear consciousness whether
 you are carrying the outer cloak, the bowl or robe, acting with clear conscious
ness whether you are eating, drinking, munching, savoring, acting with clear
 consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature, acting with
 clear consciousness whether you are walking, standing, sitting, asleep,
 awake, talking or being silent.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overcoming of the five hindrances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As soon, brahman, as he is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness,
 the Tathagata disciplines him further, saying: 'Come you, monk, choose
 a remote lodging in a forest, at the root of a tree, on a mountain slope,
 in a glen, a hill cave, a cemetery, a woodland grove, in the open, or on
 a heap of straw.' On returning from alms-gathering after the meal, the monk
 sits down crosslegged, holding the back erect, having made mindfulness
 rise up in front of him.
 He, getting rid of covetousness for the world, dwells with a mind devoid
 of covetousness, he cleanses the mind of covetousness.
 Getting rid of the taint of ill-will, he dwells benevolent in mind; compassiona
te and merciful towards all creatures and beings, he cleanses the mind of
 ill-will.
 Getting rid of sloth and torpor, he dwells without sloth or torpor; perceiving
 the light, mindful and clearly conscious he cleanses the mind of sloth
 and torpor.
 Getting rid of restlessness and worry, he dwells calmly; the mind inward
 tranquil, he cleanses the mind of restlessness and worry.
 Getting rid of doubt, he dwells doubt-crossed; unperplexed as to the states
 that are skilled,5 he cleanses his mind of doubt.
\end_layout

Jhana
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"He, by getting rid of these five hindrances,6 which are defilements of
 the mind and deleterious to intuitive wisdom, aloof from pleasures of the
 senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, enters and abides in the first
 meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness and is rapturous and joyful.
 By allaying initial thought and discursive thought, his mind subjectively
 tranquilized and fixed on one point, he enters and abides in the second
 meditation which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought, is
 born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful.
 By the fading out of rapture, he dwells with equanimity, attentive and
 clearly conscious, and experiences in his person that joy of which the
 ariyans7 say: 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,' and
 he enters and abides in the third meditation.
 By getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former pleasures and
 sorrows, he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither
 anguish nor joy, and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Brahman, such is my instruction for those monks who are learners who, perfectio
n being not yet attained, dwell longing for the incomparable security from
 the bonds.
 But as for those monks who are perfected ones, the cankers destroyed, who
 have lived the life, done what was to be done, shed the burden, attained
 to their own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, and who are
 freed by perfect profound knowledge — these things conduce both to their
 abiding in ease here and now as well as to their mindfulness and clear
 consciousness."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this had been said, the brahman Ganaka-Moggallana spoke thus to the
 Lord:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Now, on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama, do
 all the good Gotama's disciples attain the unchanging goal8 — nibbana or
 do some not attain it?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Some of my disciples, brahman, on being exhorted and instructed thus by
 me, attain the unchanging goal — nibbana; some do not attain it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What is the cause, good Gotama, what the reason that; since nibbana does
 exist, since the way leading to nibbana exists, since the good Gotama exists
 as adviser, some of the good Gotama's disciples on being exhorted thus
 and instructed thus by the good Gotama, attain the unchanging goal — nibbana,
 but some do not attain it?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well then, brahman, I will question you on this point in reply.
 As it is pleasing to you, so you may answer me.
 What do you think about this, brahman? Are you skilled in the way leading
 to Rajagaha?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes, sir, skilled am I in the way leading to Rajagaha."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What do you think about this? A man might come along here wanting to go
 to Rajagaha.
 Having approached you, he might speak thus: 'I want to go to Rajagaha,
 sir; show me the way to this Rajagaha.' You might speak thus to him: "Yes,
 my good man, this road goes to Rajagaha; go along it for a while.
 When you have gone along it for a while you will see a village; go along
 for a while; when you have gone along for a while you will see a market
 town; go for a while.
 When you have gone along for a while you will see Rajagaha with its delightful
 parks, delightful forests, delightful fields, delightful ponds.
 But although he has been exhorted and instructed thus by you, he might
 take the wrong road and go westwards.
 Then a second man might come along wanting to go to Rajagaha...(as above)...
 you will see Rajagaha with its delightful...
 ponds.' Exhorted and instructed thus by you he might get to Rajagaha safely.
 What is the cause, brahman, what the reason that, since Rajagaha does exist,
 since the way leading to Rajagaha exists, since you exist as adviser, the
 one man, although being exhorted and instructed thus by you, may take the
 wrong road and go westwards while the other may get to Rajagaha safely?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What can I, good Gotama, do in this matter? A shower of the way, good Gotama,
 am I."

"Even so, brahman, nibbana does exist, the way leading to nibbana exists
 and I exist as adviser.
 But some of my disciples, on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain
 the unchanging goal — nibbana, some do not attain it.
 What can I, brahman, do in this matter? A shower of the way, brahman, is
 a Tathagata."
\end_layout

When this had been said, the brahman Ganaka-Moggallana spoke thus to the
 Lord:

\begin_layout Standard
"Good Gotama, as for those persons who, in want of a way of living, having
 gone forth from home into homelessness without faith, who are crafty, fraudulen
t, deceitful, who are unbalanced and puffed up, who are shifty, scurrilous
 and of loose talk, the doors of whose sense-organs are not guarded, who
 do not know moderation in eating, who are not intent on vigilance, indifferent
 to recluseship, not of keen respect for the training, who are ones for
 abundance, lax, taking the lead in backsliding, shirking the burden of
 seclusion, who are indolent, of feeble energy, of confused mindfulness,
 not clearly conscious, not concentrated but of wandering minds, who are
 weak in wisdom, drivelers — the good Gotama is not in communion with them.
 But as for those young men of respectable families who have gone forth
 from home into homelessness from faith, who are not crafty, fraudulent
 or deceitful, who are not unbalanced or puffed up, who are not shifty,
 scurrilous or of loose talk, the doors of whose sense-organs are guarded,
 who know moderation in eating, who are intent on vigilance, longing for
 recluseship, of keen respect for the training, who are not ones for abundance,
 not lax, shirking, backsliding, taking the lead in seclusion, who are of
 stirred up energy, self-resolute, with mindfulness aroused, clearly conscious,
 concentrated, their minds one-pointed, who have wisdom, are not drivelers
 — the good Gotama is in communion with them.
 As, good Gotama, black gum is pointed to as chief of root-scents, as red
 sandalwood is pointed to as chief of the pith-scents, as jasmine is pointed
 to as chief of the flower scents — even so is the exhortation of the good
 Gotama highest among the teachings of today.

Thus have I heard: At one time the Lord was staying near Rajagaha in the

 Now at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in the Forest Hut.1 Then
 prince Jayasena,2 who was always pacing up and down, always roaming about
 on foot, approached the novice Aciravata; having approached he exchanged
 greetings with the novice Aciravata; having exchanged greetings of friendliness
 and courtesy, he sat down at a respectful distance.
 While he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Prince Jayasena spoke
 thus to the novice Aciravata:

And soon after Prince Jayasena had departed, the novice Aciravata approached

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the novice Aciravata told

 When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the novice Aciravata:

 attained by renunciation, realized by renunciation — such a situation does

 It is as if, Aggivessana, among elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed,
 two elephants, two horses or two oxen are well tamed, well trained, and
 two are not tamed, not trained.
 What do you think about this, Aggivessana? Would these two elephants or

 or a market-town which two friends, coming hand in hand from that village
 or market-town might approach; having approached the mountain slope one
 friend might remain at the foot while the other might climb to the top.
 Then the friend standing at the foot of the mountain slope might speak
 thus to the one standing on the top: 'My dear, what do you see as you stand
 on the top of the mountain slope?' He might reply: 'As I stand on the top

 delightful stretches of level ground delightful ponds.' But the other might
 speak thus: 'This is impossible, it cannot come to pass, my dear, that,
 as you stand on the top of the mountain slope, you should see...

 slope having come down to the foot and taken his friend by the arm, making
 him climb to the top of the mountain slope and giving him a moment in which

"As, Aggivessana, a noble anointed king addresses an elephant hunter saying;
 'You, good elephant hunter, mount the king's elephant and go into an elephant
 forest.
 When you see a forest elephant, tie him to the neck of the king's elephant.'
 And, Aggivessana, the elephant hunter having answered: 'Yes, sire,' in
 assent to the noble anointed king, mounts the king's elephant and goes
 into an elephant forest.
 Seeing a forest elephant, he ties him to the neck of the king's elephant.
 So the king's elephant brings him out into the open.
 But, Aggivessana, the forest elephant has this longing, that is to say
 for the elephant forest.
 But in regard to him the elephant hunter tells the noble anointed king
 that the forest elephant has got out into the open.
 The noble anointed king then addresses an elephant tamer, saying: 'Come
 you, good elephant tamer, tame the forest elephant by subduing his forest
 ways, by subduing his forest memories, and aspirations and by subduing
 his distress, his fretting and fever for the forest, by making him pleased
 with the villages and by accustoming him to human ways.'

\begin_layout Standard
"And, Aggivessana, the elephant tamer, having answered 'Yes, sire,' in assent
 to the noble anointed king, driving a great post into the ground ties the
 forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways...
 and accustom him to human ways.
 Then the elephant tamer addresses him with such words as are gentle, pleasing
 to the ear, affectionate, going to the heart, urbane, pleasant to the manyfolk,
 liked by the manyfolk.
 And, Aggivessana, the forest elephant, on being addressed with words that
 are gentle...
 liked by the manyfolk, listens, lends ear and bends his mind to learning.
 Next the elephant tamer supplies him with grass-fodder and water.
 When, Aggivessana, the forest elephant has accepted the grass-fodder and
 water from the elephant tamer, it occurs to the elephant tamer: 'The king's
 elephant will now live.' Then the elephant tamer makes him do a further
 task, saying: 'Take up, put down.' When, Aggivessana the king's elephant
 is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to take
 up and put down, then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task, saying:
 'Get up, sit down.' When, Aggivessana, the king's elephant is obedient to
 the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to get up and sit down,
 then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task; known as 'standing
 your ground': he ties a shield to the great beast's trunk; a man holding
 a lance is sitting on his neck, and men holding lances are standing surrounding
 him on all sides; and the elephant tamer, holding a lance with a long shaft,
 is standing in front.
 While he is doing the task of 'standing your ground' he does not move a
 fore-leg nor does he move a hind-leg, nor does he move the forepart of
 his body, nor does he move the hindpart of his body, nor does he move his
 head, nor does he move an ear, nor does he move a tusk, nor does he move
 his tail, nor does he move his trunk.
 A king's elephant is one who endures blows of sword, axe, arrow, hatchet,
 and the resounding din of drum and kettle-drum, conch and tam-tam, he is

 tamed, the Awakened One, the Lord.
 He makes known this world with the devas, with Mara, with Brahma, the creation
 with its recluses and brahmans, its devas and men, having realized them
 by his own super-knowledge.
 He teaches dhamma which is lovely at the beginning, lovely in the middle,
 lovely at the ending, with the spirit and the letters; he proclaims the
 Brahma-faring,3 wholly fulfilled, quite purified.
 A householder or a householder's son or one born in another family hears
 that dhamma.
 Having heard that dhamma he gains faith in the Tathagata.
 Endowed with this faith that he has acquired, he reflects in this way:
 'The household life is confined and dusty, going forth is in the open;
 it is not easy for one who lives in a house to fare the Brahma-faring wholly
 fulfilled, wholly pure, polished like a conch-shell.
 Suppose now that I, having cut off hair and beard, having put on saffron

 rid of his wealth, be it small or great, getting rid of his circle of relations

 that the section on the Four Applications of Mindfulness (satipatthana)
 is here followed by the second meditation (jhana) without mention of the
 first.
 This may either refer to a meditator who, already previously, has attained
 to the first jhana, or, which seems more probable, it is meant to indicate
 that the intensive practice of Satipatthana which, through emphasis on
 bare observation, tends to reduce discursive thought, and enables the meditator
 to enter directly into the second jhana, which is free from initial and
 discursive thought (vitakka-vicara).
 This latter explanation is favored by the facts that (1) in our text, the
 practice of Satipatthana is preceded by the temporary abandonment of the
 five Hindrances, which indicates a high degree of concentration approaching
 that of the jhana; (2) in our text, the meditator is advised not to engage

Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The essence of the Buddha's teaching can be summed up in two principles:
 the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.
 The first covers the side of doctrine, and the primary response it elicits
 is understanding; the second covers the side of discipline, in the broadest
 sense of that word, and the primary response it calls for is practice.
 In the structure of the teaching these two principles lock together into
 an indivisible unity called the dhamma-vinaya, the doctrine-and-discipline,
 or, in brief, the Dhamma.
 The internal unity of the Dhamma is guaranteed by the fact that the last
 of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the way, is the Noble Eightfold
 Path, while the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, right view, is
 the understanding of the Four Noble Truths.
 Thus the two principles penetrate and include one another, the formula
 of the Four Noble Truths containing the Eightfold Path and the Noble Eightfold
 Path containing the Four Truths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this integral unity, it would be pointless to pose the question which
 of the two aspects of the Dhamma has greater value, the doctrine or the
 path.
 But if we did risk the pointless by asking that question, the answer would
 have to be the path.
 The path claims primacy because it is precisely this that brings the teaching
 to life.
 The path translates the Dhamma from a collection of abstract formulas into
 a continually unfolding disclosure of truth.
 It gives an outlet from the problem of suffering with which the teaching
 starts.
 And it makes the teaching's goal, liberation from suffering, accessible
 to us in our own experience, where alone it takes on authentic meaning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To follow the Noble Eightfold Path is a matter of practice rather than intellect
ual knowledge, but to apply the path correctly it has to be properly understood.
 In fact, right understanding of the path is itself a part of the practice.
 It is a facet of right view, the first path factor, the forerunner and
 guide for the rest of the path.
 Thus, though initial enthusiasm might suggest that the task of intellectual
 comprehension may be shelved as a bothersome distraction, mature consideration
 reveals it to be quite essential to ultimate success in the practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The present book aims at contributing towards a proper understanding of
 the Noble Eightfold Path by investigating its eight factors and their component
s to determine exactly what they involve.
 I have attempted to be concise, using as the framework for exposition the
 Buddha's own words in explanation of the path factors, as found in the
 Sutta Pitaka of the Pali canon.
 To assist the reader with limited access to primary sources even in translation
, I have tried to confine my selection of quotations as much as possible
 (but not completely) to those found in Venerable Nyanatiloka's classic
 anthology, The Word of the Buddha.
 In some cases passages taken from that work have been slightly modified,
 to accord with my own preferred renderings.
 For further amplification of meaning I have sometimes drawn upon the commentari
es; especially in my accounts of concentration and wisdom (Chapters VII
 and VIII) I have relied heavily on the Visuddhimagga(The Path of Purification),
 a vast encyclopedic work which systematizes the practice of the path in
 a detailed and comprehensive manner.
 Limitations of space prevent an exhaustive treatment of each factor.
 To compensate for this deficiency I have included a list of recommended
 readings at the end, which the reader may consult for more detailed explanation
s of individual path factors.
 For full commitment to the practice of the path, however, especially in
 its advanced stages of concentration and insight, it will be extremely
 helpful to have contact with a properly qualified teacher.

Chapter I: The Way to the End of Suffering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The search for a spiritual path is born out of suffering.
 It does not start with lights and ecstasy, but with the hard tacks of pain,
 disappointment, and confusion.
 However, for suffering to give birth to a genuine spiritual search, it
 must amount to more than something passively received from without.
 It has to trigger an inner realization, a perception which pierces through
 the facile complacency of our usual encounter with the world to glimpse
 the insecurity perpetually gaping underfoot.
 When this insight dawns, even if only momentarily, it can precipitate a
 profound personal crisis.
 It overturns accustomed goals and values, mocks our routine preoccupations,
 leaves old enjoyments stubbornly unsatisfying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first such changes generally are not welcome.
 We try to deny our vision and to smother our doubts; we struggle to drive
 away the discontent with new pursuits.
 But the flame of inquiry, once lit, continues to burn, and if we do not
 let ourselves be swept away by superficial readjustments or slouch back
 into a patched up version of our natural optimism, eventually the original
 glimmering of insight will again flare up, again confront us with our essential
 plight.
 It is precisely at that point, with all escape routes blocked, that we
 are ready to seek a way to bring our disquietude to an end.
 No longer can we continue to drift complacently through life, driven blindly
 by our hunger for sense pleasures and by the pressure of prevailing social
 norms.
 A deeper reality beckons us; we have heard the call of a more stable, more
 authentic happiness, and until we arrive at our destination we cannot rest
 content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it is just then that we find ourselves facing a new difficulty.
 Once we come to recognize the need for a spiritual path we discover that
 spiritual teachings are by no means homogeneous and mutually compatible.
 When we browse through the shelves of humanity's spiritual heritage, both
 ancient and contemporary, we do not find a single tidy volume but a veritable
 bazaar of spiritual systems and disciplines each offering themselves to
 us as the highest, the fastest, the most powerful, or the most profound
 solution to our quest for the Ultimate.
 Confronted with this melange, we fall into confusion trying to size them
 up — to decide which is truly liberative, a real solution to our needs,
 and which is a sidetrack beset with hidden flaws.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach to resolving this problem that is popular today is the eclectic
 one: to pick and choose from the various traditions whatever seems amenable
 to our needs, welding together different practices and techniques into
 a synthetic whole that is personally satisfying.
 Thus one may combine Buddhist mindfulness meditation with sessions of Hindu
 mantra recitation, Christian prayer with Sufi dancing, Jewish Kabbala with
 Tibetan visualization exercises.
 Eclecticism, however, though sometimes helpful in making a transition from
 a predominantly worldly and materialistic way of life to one that takes
 on a spiritual hue, eventually wears thin.
 While it makes a comfortable halfway house, it is not comfortable as a
 final vehicle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two interrelated flaws in eclecticism that account for its ultimate
 inadequacy.
 One is that eclecticism compromises the very traditions it draws upon.
 The great spiritual traditions themselves do not propose their disciplines
 as independent techniques that may be excised from their setting and freely
 recombined to enhance the felt quality of our lives.
 They present them, rather, as parts of an integral whole, of a coherent
 vision regarding the fundamental nature of reality and the final goal of
 the spiritual quest.
 A spiritual tradition is not a shallow stream in which one can wet one's
 feet and then beat a quick retreat to the shore.
 It is a mighty, tumultuous river which would rush through the entire landscape
 of one's life, and if one truly wishes to travel on it, one must be courageous
 enough to launch one's boat and head out for the depths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second defect in eclecticism follows from the first.
 As spiritual practices are built upon visions regarding the nature of reality
 and the final good, these visions are not mutually compatible.
 When we honestly examine the teachings of these traditions, we will find
 that major differences in perspective reveal themselves to our sight, differenc
es which cannot be easily dismissed as alternative ways of saying the same
 thing.
 Rather, they point to very different experiences constituting the supreme
 goal and the path that must be trodden to reach that goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, because of the differences in perspectives and practices that the
 different spiritual traditions propose, once we decide that we have outgrown
 eclecticism and feel that we are ready to make a serious commitment to
 one particular path, we find ourselves confronted with the challenge of
 choosing a path that will lead us to true enlightenment and liberation.
 One cue to resolving this dilemma is to clarify to ourselves our fundamental
 aim, to determine what we seek in a genuinely liberative path.
 If we reflect carefully, it will become clear that the prime requirement
 is a way to the end of suffering.
 All problems ultimately can be reduced to the problem of suffering; thus
 what we need is a way that will end this problem finally and completely.
 Both these qualifying words are important.
 The path has to lead to a complete end of suffering, to an end of suffering
 in all its forms, and to a final end of suffering, to bring suffering to
 an irreversible stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But here we run up against another question.
 How are we to find such a path — a path which has the capacity to lead
 us to the full and final end of suffering? Until we actually follow a path
 to its goal we cannot know with certainty where it leads, and in order
 to follow a path to its goal we must place complete trust in the efficacy
 of the path.
 The pursuit of a spiritual path is not like selecting a new suit of clothes.
 To select a new suit one need only try on a number of suits, inspect oneself
 in the mirror, and select the suit in which one appears most attractive.
 The choice of a spiritual path is closer to marriage: one wants a partner
 for life, one whose companionship will prove as trustworthy and durable
 as the pole star in the night sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Faced with this new dilemma, we may think that we have reached a dead end
 and conclude that we have nothing to guide us but personal inclination,
 if not a flip of the coin.
 However, our selection need not be as blind and uninformed as we imagine,
 for we do have a guideline to help us.
 Since spiritual paths are generally presented in the framework of a total
 teaching, we can evaluate the effectiveness of any particular path by investiga
ting the teaching which expounds it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In making this investigation we can look to three criteria as standards
 for evaluation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) First, the teaching has to give a full and accurate picture of the range
 of suffering.
 If the picture of suffering it gives is incomplete or defective, then the
 path it sets forth will most likely be flawed, unable to yield a satisfactory
 solution.
 Just as an ailing patient needs a doctor who can make a full and correct
 diagnosis of his illness, so in seeking release from suffering we need
 a teaching that presents a reliable account of our condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The second criterion calls for a correct analysis of the causes giving
 rise to suffering.
 The teaching cannot stop with a survey of the outward symptoms.
 It has to penetrate beneath the symptoms to the level of causes, and to
 describe those causes accurately.
 If a teaching makes a faulty causal analysis, there is little likelihood
 that its treatment will succeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) The third criterion pertains directly to the path itself.
 It stipulates that the path which the teaching offers has to remove suffering
 at its source.
 This means it must provide a method to cut off suffering by eradicating
 its causes.
 If it fails to bring about this root-level solution, its value is ultimately
 nil.
 The path it prescribes might help to remove symptoms and make us feel that
 all is well; but one afflicted with a fatal disease cannot afford to settle
 for cosmetic surgery when below the surface the cause of his malady continues
 to thrive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, we find three requirements for a teaching proposing to offer
 a true path to the end of suffering: first, it has to set forth a full
 and accurate picture of the range of suffering; second, it must present
 a correct analysis of the causes of suffering; and third, it must give
 us the means to eradicate the causes of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is not the place to evaluate the various spiritual disciplines in terms
 of these criteria.
 Our concern is only with the Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha, and with
 the solution this teaching offers to the problem of suffering.
 That the teaching should be relevant to this problem is evident from its
 very nature; for it is formulated, not as a set of doctrines about the
 origin and end of things commanding belief, but as a message of deliverance
 from suffering claiming to be verifiable in our own experience.
 Along with that message there comes a method of practice, a way leading
 to the end of suffering.
 This way is the Noble Eightfold Path (ariya atthangika magga).
 The Eightfold Path stands at the very heart of the Buddha's teaching.
 It was the discovery of the path that gave the Buddha's own enlightenment
 a universal significance and elevated him from the status of a wise and
 benevolent sage to that of a world teacher.
 To his own disciples he was pre-eminently "the arouser of the path unarisen
 before, the producer of the path not produced before, the declarer of the
 path not declared before, the knower of the path, the seer of the path,
 the guide along the path" (MN 108).
 And he himself invites the seeker with the promise and challenge: "You
 yourselves must strive.
 The Buddhas are only teachers.
 The meditative ones who practice the path are released from the bonds of
 evil" (Dhp.
 v.
 276).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see the Noble Eightfold Path as a viable vehicle to liberation, we have
 to check it out against our three criteria: to look at the Buddha's account
 of the range of suffering, his analysis of its causes, and the programme
 he offers as a remedy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Range of Suffering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha does not merely touch the problem of suffering tangentially;
 he makes it, rather, the very cornerstone of his teaching.
 He starts the Four Noble Truths that sum up his message with the announcement
 that life is inseparably tied to something he calls dukkha.
 The Pali word is often translated as suffering, but it means something
 deeper than pain and misery.
 It refers to a basic unsatisfactoriness running through our lives, the
 lives of all but the enlightened.
 Sometimes this unsatisfactoriness erupts into the open as sorrow, grief,
 disappointment, or despair; but usually it hovers at the edge of our awareness
 as a vague unlocalized sense that things are never quite perfect, never
 fully adequate to our expectations of what they should be.
 This fact of dukkha, the Buddha says, is the only real spiritual problem.
 The other problems — the theological and metaphysical questions that have
 taunted religious thinkers through the centuries — he gently waves aside
 as "matters not tending to liberation." What he teaches, he says, is just
 suffering and the ending of suffering, dukkha and its cessation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha does not stop with generalities.
 He goes on to expose the different forms that dukkha takes, both the evident
 and the subtle.
 He starts with what is close at hand, with the suffering inherent in the
 physical process of life itself.
 Here dukkha shows up in the events of birth, aging, and death, in our susceptib
ility to sickness, accidents, and injuries, even in hunger and thirst.
 It appears again in our inner reactions to disagreeable situations and
 events: in the sorrow, anger, frustration, and fear aroused by painful
 separations, by unpleasant encounters, by the failure to get what we want.
 Even our pleasures, the Buddha says, are not immune from dukkha.
 They give us happiness while they last, but they do not last forever; eventuall
y they must pass away, and when they go the loss leaves us feeling deprived.
 Our lives, for the most part, are strung out between the thirst for pleasure
 and the fear of pain.
 We pass our days running after the one and running away from the other,
 seldom enjoying the peace of contentment; real satisfaction seems somehow
 always out of reach, just beyond the next horizon.
 Then in the end we have to die: to give up the identity we spent our whole
 life building, to leave behind everything and everyone we love.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But even death, the Buddha teaches, does not bring us to the end of dukkha,
 for the life process does not stop with death.
 When life ends in one place, with one body, the "mental continuum," the
 individual stream of consciousness, springs up again elsewhere with a new
 body as its physical support.
 Thus the cycle goes on over and over — birth, aging, and death — driven
 by the thirst for more existence.
 The Buddha declares that this round of rebirths — called samsara, "the
 wandering" — has been turning through beginningless time.
 It is without a first point, without temporal origin.
 No matter how far back in time we go we always find living beings — ourselves
 in previous lives — wandering from one state of existence to another.
 The Buddha describes various realms where rebirth can take place: realms
 of torment, the animal realm, the human realm, realms of celestial bliss.
 But none of these realms can offer a final refuge.
 Life in any plane must come to an end.
 It is impermanent and thus marked with that insecurity which is the deepest
 meaning of dukkha.
 For this reason one aspiring to the complete end of dukkha cannot rest
 content with any mundane achievement, with any status, but must win emancipatio
n from the entire unstable whirl.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Causes of Suffering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A teaching proposing to lead to the end of suffering must, as we said, give
 a reliable account of its causal origination.
 For if we want to put a stop to suffering, we have to stop it where it
 begins, with its causes.
 To stop the causes requires a thorough knowledge of what they are and how
 they work; thus the Buddha devotes a sizeable section of his teaching to
 laying bare "the truth of the origin of dukkha." The origin he locates within
 ourselves, in a fundamental malady that permeates our being, causing disorder
 in our own minds and vitiating our relationships with others and with the
 world.
 The sign of this malady can be seen in our proclivity to certain unwholesome
 mental states called in Pali kilesas, usually translated "defilements."
 The most basic defilements are the triad of greed, aversion, and delusion.
 Greed (lobha) is self-centered desire: the desire for pleasure and possessions,
 the drive for survival, the urge to bolster the sense of ego with power,
 status, and prestige.
 Aversion (dosa) signifies the response of negation, expressed as rejection,
 irritation, condemnation, hatred, enmity, anger, and violence.
 Delusion (moha) means mental darkness: the thick coat of insensitivity
 which blocks out clear understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these three roots emerge the various other defilements — conceit, jealousy,
 ambition, lethargy, arrogance, and the rest — and from all these defilements
 together, the roots and the branches, comes dukkha in its diverse forms:
 as pain and sorrow, as fear and discontent, as the aimless drifting through
 the round of birth and death.
 To gain freedom from suffering, therefore, we have to eliminate the defilements.
 But the work of removing the defilements has to proceed in a methodical
 way.
 It cannot be accomplished simply by an act of will, by wanting them to
 go away.
 The work must be guided by investigation.
 We have to find out what the defilements depend upon and then see how it
 lies within our power to remove their support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha teaches that there is one defilement which gives rise to all
 the others, one root which holds them all in place.
 This root is ignorance (avijja).1 Ignorance is not mere absence of knowledge,
 a lack of knowing particular pieces of information.
 Ignorance can co-exist with a vast accumulation of itemized knowledge,
 and in its own way it can be tremendously shrewd and resourceful.
 As the basic root of dukkha, ignorance is a fundamental darkness shrouding
 the mind.
 Sometimes this ignorance operates in a passive manner, merely obscuring
 correct understanding.
 At other times it takes on an active role: it becomes the great deceiver,
 conjuring up a mass of distorted perceptions and conceptions which the
 mind grasps as attributes of the world, unaware that they are its own deluded
 constructs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In these erroneous perceptions and ideas we find the soil that nurtures
 the defilements.
 The mind catches sight of some possibility of pleasure, accepts it at face
 value, and the result is greed.
 Our hunger for gratification is thwarted, obstacles appear, and up spring
 anger and aversion.
 Or we struggle over ambiguities, our sight clouds, and we become lost in
 delusion.
 With this we discover the breeding ground of dukkha: ignorance issuing
 in the defilements, the defilements issuing in suffering.
 As long as this causal matrix stands we are not yet beyond danger.
 We might still find pleasure and enjoyment — sense pleasures, social pleasures,
 pleasures of the mind and heart.
 But no matter how much pleasure we might experience, no matter how successful
 we might be at dodging pain, the basic problem remains at the core of our
 being and we continue to move within the bounds of dukkha.

\begin_layout Standard
Cutting Off the Causes of Suffering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To free ourselves from suffering fully and finally we have to eliminate
 it by the root, and that means to eliminate ignorance.
 But how does one go about eliminating ignorance? The answer follows clearly
 from the nature of the adversary.
 Since ignorance is a state of not knowing things as they really are, what
 is needed is knowledge of things as they really are.
 Not merely conceptual knowledge, knowledge as idea, but perceptual knowledge,
 a knowing which is also a seeing.
 This kind of knowing is called wisdom (pañña).
 Wisdom helps to correct the distorting work of ignorance.
 It enables us to grasp things as they are in actuality, directly and immediatel
y, free from the screen of ideas, views, and assumptions our minds ordinarily
 set up between themselves and the real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To eliminate ignorance we need wisdom, but how is wisdom to be acquired?
 As indubitable knowledge of the ultimate nature of things, wisdom cannot
 be gained by mere learning, by gathering and accumulating a battery of
 facts.
 However, the Buddha says, wisdom can be cultivated.
 It comes into being through a set of conditions, conditions which we have
 the power to develop.
 These conditions are actually mental factors, components of consciousness,
 which fit together into a systematic structure that can be called a path
 in the word's essential meaning: a courseway for movement leading to a
 goal.
 The goal here is the end of suffering, and the path leading to it is the
 Noble Eightfold Path with its eight factors: right view, right intention,
 right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
 and right concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha calls this path the middle way (majjhima patipada).
 It is the middle way because it steers clear of two extremes, two misguided
 attempts to gain release from suffering.
 One is the extreme of indulgence in sense pleasures, the attempt to extinguish
 dissatisfaction by gratifying desire.
 This approach gives pleasure, but the enjoyment won is gross, transitory,
 and devoid of deep contentment.
 The Buddha recognized that sensual desire can exercise a tight grip over
 the minds of human beings, and he was keenly aware of how ardently attached
 people become to the pleasures of the senses.
 But he also knew that this pleasure is far inferior to the happiness that
 arises from renunciation, and therefore he repeatedly taught that the way
 to the Ultimate eventually requires the relinquishment of sensual desire.
 Thus the Buddha describes the indulgence in sense pleasures as "low, common,
 worldly, ignoble, not leading to the goal."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other extreme is the practice of self-mortification, the attempt to
 gain liberation by afflicting the body.
 This approach may stem from a genuine aspiration for deliverance, but it
 works within the compass of a wrong assumption that renders the energy
 expended barren of results.
 The error is taking the body to be the cause of bondage, when the real
 source of trouble lies in the mind — the mind obsessed by greed, aversion,
 and delusion.
 To rid the mind of these defilements the affliction of the body is not
 only useless but self-defeating, for it is the impairment of a necessary
 instrument.
 Thus the Buddha describes this second extreme as "painful, ignoble, not
 leading to the goal."2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aloof from these two extreme approaches is the Noble Eightfold Path, called
 the middle way, not in the sense that it effects a compromise between the
 extremes, but in the sense that it transcends them both by avoiding the
 errors that each involves.
 The path avoids the extreme of sense indulgence by its recognition of the
 futility of desire and its stress on renunciation.
 Desire and sensuality, far from being means to happiness, are springs of
 suffering to be abandoned as the requisite of deliverance.
 But the practice of renunciation does not entail the tormenting of the
 body.
 It consists in mental training, and for this the body must be fit, a sturdy
 support for the inward work.
 Thus the body is to be looked after well, kept in good health, while the
 mental faculties are trained to generate the liberating wisdom.
 That is the middle way, the Noble Eightfold Path, which "gives rise to
 vision, gives rise to knowledge, and leads to peace, to direct knowledge,
 to enlightenment, to Nibbana."3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter II: Right View (Samma Ditthi)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path are not steps to be followed
 in sequence, one after another.
 They can be more aptly described as components rather than as steps, comparable
 to the intertwining strands of a single cable that requires the contributions
 of all the strands for maximum strength.
 With a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneous
ly, each supporting the others.
 However, until that point is reached, some sequence in the unfolding of
 the path is inevitable.
 Considered from the standpoint of practical training, the eight path factors
 divide into three groups: (i) the moral discipline group (silakkhandha),
 made up of right speech, right action, and right livelihood; (ii) the concentra
tion group (samadhikkhandha), made up of right effort, right mindfulness,
 and right concentration; and (iii) the wisdom group (paññakkhandha), made
 up of right view and right intention.
 These three groups represent three stages of training: the training in
 the higher moral discipline, the training in the higher consciousness,
 and the training in the higher wisdom.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The order of the three trainings is determined by the overall aim and direction
 of the path.
 Since the final goal to which the path leads, liberation from suffering,
 depends ultimately on uprooting ignorance, the climax of the path must
 be the training directly opposed to ignorance.
 This is the training in wisdom, designed to awaken the faculty of penetrative
 understanding which sees things "as they really are." Wisdom unfolds by
 degrees, but even the faintest flashes of insight presuppose as their basis
 a mind that has been concentrated, cleared of disturbance and distraction.
 Concentration is achieved through the training in the higher consciousness,
 the second division of the path, which brings the calm and collectedness
 needed to develop wisdom.
 But in order for the mind to be unified in concentration, a check must
 be placed on the unwholesome dispositions which ordinarily dominate its
 workings, since these dispositions disperse the beam of attention and scatter
 it among a multitude of concerns.
 The unwholesome dispositions continue to rule as long as they are permitted
 to gain expression through the channels of body and speech as bodily and
 verbal deeds.
 Therefore, at the very outset of training, it is necessary to restrain
 the faculties of action, to prevent them from becoming tools of the defilements.
 This task is accomplished by the first division of the path, the training
 in moral discipline.
 Thus the path evolves through its three stages, with moral discipline as
 the foundation for concentration, concentration the foundation for wisdom,
 and wisdom the direct instrument for reaching liberation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perplexity sometimes arises over an apparent inconsistency in the arrangement
 of the path factors and the threefold training.
 Wisdom — which includes right view and right intention — is the last stage
 in the threefold training, yet its factors are placed at the beginning
 of the path rather than at its end, as might be expected according to the
 canon of strict consistency.
 The sequence of the path factors, however, is not the result of a careless
 slip, but is determined by an important logistical consideration, namely,
 that right view and right intention of a preliminary type are called for
 at the outset as the spur for entering the threefold training.
 Right view provides the perspective for practice, right intention the sense
 of direction.
 But the two do not expire in this preparatory role.
 For when the mind has been refined by the training in moral discipline
 and concentration, it arrives at a superior right view and right intention,
 which now form the proper training in the higher wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right view is the forerunner of the entire path, the guide for all the other
 factors.
 It enables us to understand our starting point, our destination, and the
 successive landmarks to pass as practice advances.
 To attempt to engage in the practice without a foundation of right view
 is to risk getting lost in the futility of undirected movement.
 Doing so might be compared to wanting to drive someplace without consulting
 a roadmap or listening to the suggestions of an experienced driver.
 One might get into the car and start to drive, but rather than approaching
 closer to one's destination, one is more likely to move farther away from
 it.
 To arrive at the desired place one has to have some idea of its general
 direction and of the roads leading to it.
 Analogous considerations apply to the practice of the path, which takes
 place in a framework of understanding established by right view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The importance of right view can be gauged from the fact that our perspectives
 on the crucial issues of reality and value have a bearing that goes beyond
 mere theoretical convictions.
 They govern our attitudes, our actions, our whole orientation to existence.
 Our views might not be clearly formulated in our mind; we might have only
 a hazy conceptual grasp of our beliefs.
 But whether formulated or not, expressed or maintained in silence, these
 views have a far-reaching influence.
 They structure our perceptions, order our values, crystallize into the
 ideational framework through which we interpret to ourselves the meaning
 of our being in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These views then condition action.
 They lie behind our choices and goals, and our efforts to turn these goals
 from ideals into actuality.
 The actions themselves might determine consequences, but the actions along
 with their consequences hinge on the views from which they spring.
 Since views imply an "ontological commitment," a decision on the question
 of what is real and true, it follows that views divide into two classes,
 right views and wrong views.
 The former correspond to what is real, the latter deviate from the real
 and confirm the false in its place.
 These two different kinds of views, the Buddha teaches, lead to radically
 disparate lines of action, and thence to opposite results.
 If we hold a wrong view, even if that view is vague, it will lead us towards
 courses of action that eventuate in suffering.
 On the other hand, if we adopt a right view, that view will steer us towards
 right action, and thereby towards freedom from suffering.
 Though our conceptual orientation towards the world might seem innocuous
 and inconsequential, when looked at closely it reveals itself to be the
 decisive determinant of our whole course of future development.
 The Buddha himself says that he sees no single factor so responsible for
 the arising of unwholesome states of mind as wrong view, and no factor
 so helpful for the arising of wholesome states of mind as right view.
 Again, he says that there is no single factor so responsible for the suffering
 of living beings as wrong view, and no factor so potent in promoting the
 good of living beings as right view (AN 1:16.2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In its fullest measure right view involves a correct understanding of the
 entire Dhamma or teaching of the Buddha, and thus its scope is equal to
 the range of the Dhamma itself.
 But for practical purposes two kinds of right view stand out as primary.
 One is mundane right view, right view which operates within the confines
 of the world.
 The other is supramundane right view, the superior right view which leads
 to liberation from the world.
 The first is concerned with the laws governing material and spiritual progress
 within the round of becoming, with the principles that lead to higher and
 lower states of existence, to mundane happiness and suffering.
 The second is concerned with the principles essential to liberation.
 It does not aim merely at spiritual progress from life to life, but at
 emancipation from the cycle of recurring lives and deaths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mundane Right View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mundane right view involves a correct grasp of the law of kamma, the moral
 efficacy of action.
 Its literal name is "right view of the ownership of action" (kammassakata
 sammaditthi), and it finds its standard formulation in the statement: "Beings
 are the owners of their actions, the heirs of their actions; they spring
 from their actions, are bound to their actions, and are supported by their
 actions.
 Whatever deeds they do, good or bad, of those they shall be heirs."5 More
 specific formulations have also come down in the texts.
 One stock passage, for example, affirms that virtuous actions such as giving
 and offering alms have moral significance, that good and bad deeds produce
 corresponding fruits, that one has a duty to serve mother and father, that
 there is rebirth and a world beyond the visible one, and that religious
 teachers of high attainment can be found who expound the truth about the
 world on the basis of their own superior realization.6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand the implications of this form of right view we first have
 to examine the meaning of its key term, kamma.
 The word kamma means action.
 For Buddhism the relevant kind of action is volitional action, deeds expressive
 of morally determinate volition, since it is volition that gives the action
 ethical significance.
 Thus the Buddha expressly identifies action with volition.
 In a discourse on the analysis of kamma he says: "Monks, it is volition
 that I call action (kamma).
 Having willed, one performs an action through body, speech, or mind."7 The
 identification of kamma with volition makes kamma essentially a mental
 event, a factor originating in the mind which seeks to actualize the mind's
 drives, dispositions, and purposes.
 Volition comes into being through any of three channels — body, speech,
 or mind — called the three doors of action (kammadvara).
 A volition expressed through the body is a bodily action; a volition expressed
 through speech is a verbal action; and a volition that issues in thoughts,
 plans, ideas, and other mental states without gaining outer expression
 is a mental action.
 Thus the one factor of volition differentiates into three types of kamma
 according to the channel through which it becomes manifest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right view requires more than a simple knowledge of the general meaning
 of kamma.
 It is also necessary to understand: (i) the ethical distinction of kamma
 into the unwholesome and the wholesome; (ii) the principal cases of each
 type; and (iii) the roots from which these actions spring.
 As expressed in a sutta: "When a noble disciple understands what is kammically
 unwholesome, and the root of unwholesome kamma, what is kammically wholesome,
 and the root of wholesome kamma, then he has right view."8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(i) Taking these points in order, we find that kamma is first distinguished
 as unwholesome (akusala) and wholesome (kusala).
 Unwholesome kamma is action that is morally blameworthy, detrimental to
 spiritual development, and conducive to suffering for oneself and others.
 Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action that is morally commendable,
 helpful to spiritual growth, and productive of benefits for oneself and
 others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(ii) Innumerable instances of unwholesome and wholesome kamma can be cited,
 but the Buddha selects ten of each as primary.
 These he calls the ten courses of unwholesome and wholesome action.
 Among the ten in the two sets, three are bodily, four are verbal, and three
 are mental.
 The ten courses of unwholesome kamma may be listed as follows, divided
 by way of their doors of expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Destroying life
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking what is not given
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wrong conduct in regard to sense pleasures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verbal action:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
False speech
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slanderous speech
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harsh speech (vacikamma)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Idle chatter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Covetousness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ill will
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wrong view
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ten courses of wholesome kamma are the opposites of these: abstaining
 from the first seven courses of unwholesome kamma, being free from covetousness
 and ill will, and holding right view.
 Though the seven cases of abstinence are exercised entirely by the mind
 and do not necessarily entail overt action, they are still designated wholesome
 bodily and verbal action because they center on the control of the faculties
 of body and speech.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(iii) Actions are distinguished as wholesome and unwholesome on the basis
 of their underlying motives, called "roots" (mula), which impart their
 moral quality to the volitions concomitant with themselves.
 Thus kamma is wholesome or unwholesome according to whether its roots are
 wholesome or unwholesome.
 The roots are threefold for each set.
 The unwholesome roots are the three defilements we already mentioned —
 greed, aversion, and delusion.
 Any action originating from these is an unwholesome kamma.
 The three wholesome roots are their opposites, expressed negatively in
 the old Indian fashion as non-greed (alobha), non-aversion (adosa), and
 non-delusion (amoha).
 Though these are negatively designated, they signify not merely the absence
 of defilements but the corresponding virtues.
 Non-greed implies renunciation, detachment, and generosity; non-aversion
 implies loving-kindness, sympathy, and gentleness; and non-delusion implies
 wisdom.
 Any action originating from these roots is a wholesome kamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important feature of kamma is its capacity to produce results correspon
ding to the ethical quality of the action.
 An immanent universal law holds sway over volitional actions, bringing
 it about that these actions issue in retributive consequences, called vipaka,
 "ripenings," or phala, "fruits." The law connecting actions with their fruits
 works on the simple principle that unwholesome actions ripen in suffering,
 wholesome actions in happiness.
 The ripening need not come right away; it need not come in the present
 life at all.
 Kamma can operate across the succession of lifetimes; it can even remain
 dormant for aeons into the future.
 But whenever we perform a volitional action, the volition leaves its imprint
 on the mental continuum, where it remains as a stored up potency.
 When the stored up kamma meets with conditions favorable to its maturation,
 it awakens from its dormant state and triggers off some effect that brings
 due compensation for the original action.
 The ripening may take place in the present life, in the next life, or in
 some life subsequent to the next.
 A kamma may ripen by producing rebirth into the next existence, thus determinin
g the basic form of life; or it may ripen in the course of a lifetime, issuing
 in our varied experiences of happiness and pain, success and failure, progress
 and decline.
 But whenever it ripens and in whatever way, the same principle invariably
 holds: wholesome actions yield favorable results, unwholesome actions yield
 unfavorable results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recognize this principle is to hold right view of the mundane kind.
 This view at once excludes the multiple forms of wrong view with which
 it is incompatible.
 As it affirms that our actions have an influence on our destiny continuing
 into future lives, it opposes the nihilistic view which regards this life
 as our only existence and holds that consciousness terminates with death.
 As it grounds the distinction between good and evil, right and wrong, in
 an objective universal principle, it opposes the ethical subjectivism which
 asserts that good and evil are only postulations of personal opinion or
 means to social control.
 As it affirms that people can choose their actions freely, within limits
 set by their conditions, it opposes the "hard deterministic" line that
 our choices are always made subject to necessitation, and hence that free
 volition is unreal and moral responsibility untenable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the implications of the Buddha's teaching on the right view of kamma
 and its fruits run counter to popular trends in present-day thought, and
 it is helpful to make these differences explicit.
 The teaching on right view makes it known that good and bad, right and
 wrong, transcend conventional opinions about what is good and bad, what
 is right and wrong.
 An entire society may be predicated upon a confusion of correct moral values,
 and even though everyone within that society may applaud one particular
 kind of action as right and condemn another kind as wrong, this does not
 make them validly right and wrong.
 For the Buddha moral standards are objective and invariable.
 While the moral character of deeds is doubtlessly conditioned by the circumstan
ces under which they are performed, there are objective criteria of morality
 against which any action, or any comprehensive moral code, can be evaluated.
 This objective standard of morality is integral to the Dhamma, the cosmic
 law of truth and righteousness.
 Its transpersonal ground of validation is the fact that deeds, as expressions
 of the volitions that engender them, produce consequences for the agent,
 and that the correlations between deeds and their consequences are intrinsic
 to the volitions themselves.
 There is no divine judge standing above the cosmic process who assigns
 rewards and punishments.
 Nevertheless, the deeds themselves, through their inherent moral or immoral
 nature, generate the appropriate results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most people, the vast majority, the right view of kamma and its results
 is held out of confidence, accepted on faith from an eminent spiritual
 teacher who proclaims the moral efficacy of action.
 But even when the principle of kamma is not personally seen, it still remains
 a facet of right view.
 It is part and parcel of right view because right view is concerned with
 understanding — with understanding our place in the total scheme of things
 — and one who accepts the principle that our volitional actions possess
 a moral potency has, to that extent, grasped an important fact pertaining
 to the nature of our existence.
 However, the right view of the kammic efficacy of action need not remain
 exclusively an article of belief screened behind an impenetrable barrier.
 It can become a matter of direct seeing.
 Through the attainment of certain states of deep concentration it is possible
 to develop a special faculty called the "divine eye" (dibbacakkhu), a super-sen
sory power of vision that reveals things hidden from the eyes of flesh.
 When this faculty is developed, it can be directed out upon the world of
 living beings to investigate the workings of the kammic law.
 With the special vision it confers one can then see for oneself, with immediate
 perception, how beings pass away and re-arise according to their kamma,
 how they meet happiness and suffering through the maturation of their good
 and evil deeds.9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Superior Right View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right view of kamma and its fruits provides a rationale for engaging
 in wholesome actions and attaining high status within the round of rebirths,
 but by itself it does not lead to liberation.
 It is possible for someone to accept the law of kamma yet still limit his
 aims to mundane achievements.
 One's motive for performing noble deeds might be the accumulation of meritoriou
s kamma leading to prosperity and success here and now, a fortunate rebirth
 as a human being, or the enjoyment of celestial bliss in the heavenly worlds.
 There is nothing within the logic of kammic causality to impel the urge
 to transcend the cycle of kamma and its fruit.
 The impulse to deliverance from the entire round of becoming depends upon
 the acquisition of a different and deeper perspective, one which yields
 insight into the inherent defectiveness of all forms of samsaric existence,
 even the most exalted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This superior right view leading to liberation is the understanding of the
 Four Noble Truths.
 It is this right view that figures as the first factor of the Noble Eightfold
 Path in the proper sense: as the noble right view.
 Thus the Buddha defines the path factor of right view expressly in terms
 of the four truths: "What now is right view? It is understanding of suffering
 (dukkha), understanding of the origin of suffering, understanding of the
 cessation of suffering, understanding of the way leading to the cessation
 to suffering."10 The Eightfold Path starts with a conceptual understanding
 of the Four Noble Truths apprehended only obscurely through the media of
 thought and reflection.
 It reaches its climax in a direct intuition of those same truths, penetrated
 with a clarity tantamount to enlightenment.
 Thus it can be said that the right view of the Four Noble Truths forms
 both the beginning and the culmination of the way to the end of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first noble truth is the truth of suffering (dukkha), the inherent unsatisfa
ctoriness of existence, revealed in the impermanence, pain, and perpetual
 incompleteness intrinsic to all forms of life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the noble truth of suffering.
 Birth is suffering; aging is suffering; sickness is suffering; death is
 suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering;
 association with the unpleasant is suffering; separation from the pleasant
 is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five
 aggregates of clinging are suffering.11
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last statement makes a comprehensive claim that calls for some attention.
 The five aggregates of clinging (pañcupadanakkandha) are a classificatory
 scheme for understanding the nature of our being.
 What we are, the Buddha teaches, is a set of five aggregates — material
 form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness — all
 connected with clinging.
 We are the five and the five are us.
 Whatever we identify with, whatever we hold to as our self, falls within
 the set of five aggregates.
 Together these five aggregates generate the whole array of thoughts, emotions,
 ideas, and dispositions in which we dwell, "our world." Thus the Buddha's
 declaration that the five aggregates are dukkha in effect brings all experience
, our entire existence, into the range of dukkha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But here the question arises: Why should the Buddha say that the five aggregates
 are dukkha? The reason he says that the five aggregates are dukkha is that
 they are impermanent.
 They change from moment to moment, arise and fall away, without anything
 substantial behind them persisting through the change.
 Since the constituent factors of our being are always changing, utterly
 devoid of a permanent core, there is nothing we can cling to in them as
 a basis for security.
 There is only a constantly disintegrating flux which, when clung to in
 the desire for permanence, brings a plunge into suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second noble truth points out the cause of dukkha.
 From the set of defilements which eventuate in suffering, the Buddha singles
 out craving (tanha) as the dominant and most pervasive cause, "the origin
 of suffering."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.
 It is this craving which produces repeated existence, is bound up with
 delight and lust, and seeks pleasure here and there, namely, craving for
 sense pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.12
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third noble truth simply reverses this relationship of origination.
 If craving is the cause of dukkha, then to be free from dukkha we have
 to eliminate craving.
 Thus the Buddha says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.
 It is the complete fading away and cessation of this craving, its forsaking
 and abandonment, liberation and detachment from it.13
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state of perfect peace that comes when craving is eliminated is Nibbana(nirv
ana), the unconditioned state experienced while alive with the extinguishing
 of the flames of greed, aversion, and delusion.
 The fourth noble truth shows the way to reach the end of dukkha, the way
 to the realization of Nibbana.
 That way is the Noble Eightfold Path itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right view of the Four Noble Truths develops in two stages.
 The first is called the right view that accords with the truths (saccanulomika
 samma ditthi); the second, the right view that penetrates the truths (saccapati
vedha samma ditthi).
 To acquire the right view that accords with the truths requires a clear
 understanding of their meaning and significance in our lives.
 Such an understanding arises first by learning the truths and studying
 them.
 Subsequently it is deepened by reflecting upon them in the light of experience
 until one gains a strong conviction as to their veracity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But even at this point the truths have not been penetrated, and thus the
 understanding achieved is still defective, a matter of concept rather than
 perception.
 To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary
 to take up the practice of meditation — first to strengthen the capacity
 for sustained concentration, then to develop insight.
 Insight arises by contemplating the five aggregates, the factors of existence,
 in order to discern their real characteristics.
 At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye turns away from the
 conditioned phenomena comprised in the aggregates and shifts its focus
 to the unconditioned state, Nibbana, which becomes accessible through the
 deepened faculty of insight.
 With this shift, when the mind's eye sees Nibbana, there takes place a
 simultaneous penetration of all Four Noble Truths.
 By seeing Nibbana, the state beyond dukkha, one gains a perspective from
 which to view the five aggregates and see that they are dukkha simply because
 they are conditioned, subject to ceaseless change.
 At the same moment Nibbana is realized, craving stops; the understanding
 then dawns that craving is the true origin of dukkha.
 When Nibbana is seen, it is realized to be the state of peace, free from
 the turmoil of becoming.
 And because this experience has been reached by practicing the Noble Eightfold
 Path, one knows for oneself that the Noble Eightfold Path is truly the
 way to the end of dukkha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This right view that penetrates the Four Noble Truths comes at the end of
 the path, not at the beginning.
 We have to start with the right view conforming to the truths, acquired
 through learning and fortified through reflection.
 This view inspires us to take up the practice, to embark on the threefold
 training in moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom.
 When the training matures, the eye of wisdom opens by itself, penetrating
 the truths and freeing the mind from bondage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter III: Right Intention (Samma Sankappa)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second factor of the path is called in Pali samma sankappa, which we
 will translate as "right intention." The term is sometimes translated as
 "right thought," a rendering that can be accepted if we add the proviso
 that in the present context the word "thought" refers specifically to the
 purposive or conative aspect of mental activity, the cognitive aspect being
 covered by the first factor, right view.
 It would be artificial, however, to insist too strongly on the division
 between these two functions.
 From the Buddhist perspective, the cognitive and purposive sides of the
 mind do not remain isolated in separate compartments but intertwine and
 interact in close correlation.
 Emotional predilections influence views, and views determine predilections.
 Thus a penetrating view of the nature of existence, gained through deep
 reflection and validated through investigation, brings with it a restructuring
 of values which sets the mind moving towards goals commensurate with the
 new vision.
 The application of mind needed to achieve those goals is what is meant
 by right intention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha explains right intention as threefold: the intention of renunciation,
 the intention of good will, and the intention of harmlessness.14 The three
 are opposed to three parallel kinds of wrong intention: intention governed
 by desire, intention governed by ill will, and intention governed by harmfulnes
s.15 Each kind of right intention counters the corresponding kind of wrong
 intention.
 The intention of renunciation counters the intention of desire, the intention
 of good will counters the intention of ill will, and the intention of harmlessn
ess counters the intention of harmfulness.

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha discovered this twofold division of thought in the period prior
 to his Enlightenment (see MN 19).
 While he was striving for deliverance, meditating in the forest, he found
 that his thoughts could be distributed into two different classes.
 In one he put thoughts of desire, ill will, and harmfulness, in the other
 thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.
 Whenever he noticed thoughts of the first kind arise in him, he understood
 that those thoughts lead to harm for oneself and others, obstruct wisdom,
 and lead away from Nibbana.
 Reflecting in this way he expelled such thoughts from his mind and brought
 them to an end.
 But whenever thoughts of the second kind arose, he understood those thoughts
 to be beneficial, conducive to the growth of wisdom, aids to the attainment
 of Nibbana.
 Thus he strengthened those thoughts and brought them to completion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right intention claims the second place in the path, between right view
 and the triad of moral factors that begins with right speech, because the
 mind's intentional function forms the crucial link connecting our cognitive
 perspective with our modes of active engagement in the world.
 On the one side actions always point back to the thoughts from which they
 spring.
 Thought is the forerunner of action, directing body and speech, stirring
 them into activity, using them as its instruments for expressing its aims
 and ideals.
 These aims and ideals, our intentions, in turn point back a further step
 to the prevailing views.
 When wrong views prevail, the outcome is wrong intention giving rise to
 unwholesome actions.
 Thus one who denies the moral efficacy of action and measures achievement
 in terms of gain and status will aspire to nothing but gain and status,
 using whatever means he can to acquire them.
 When such pursuits become widespread, the result is suffering, the tremendous
 suffering of individuals, social groups, and nations out to gain wealth,
 position, and power without regard for consequences.
 The cause for the endless competition, conflict, injustice, and oppression
 does not lie outside the mind.
 These are all just manifestations of intentions, outcroppings of thoughts
 driven by greed, by hatred, by delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when the intentions are right, the actions will be right, and for the
 intentions to be right the surest guarantee is right views.
 One who recognizes the law of kamma, that actions bring retributive consequence
s, will frame his pursuits to accord with this law; thus his actions, expressive
 of his intentions, will conform to the canons of right conduct.
 The Buddha succinctly sums up the matter when he says that for a person
 who holds a wrong view, his deeds, words, plans, and purposes grounded
 in that view will lead to suffering, while for a person who holds right
 view, his deeds, words, plans, and purposes grounded in that view will
 lead to happiness.16
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the most important formulation of right view is the understanding
 of the Four Noble Truths, it follows that this view should be in some way
 determinative of the content of right intention.
 This we find to be in fact the case.
 Understanding the four truths in relation to one's own life gives rise
 to the intention of renunciation; understanding them in relation to other
 beings gives rise to the other two right intentions.
 When we see how our own lives are pervaded by dukkha, and how this dukkha
 derives from craving, the mind inclines to renunciation — to abandoning
 craving and the objects to which it binds us.
 Then, when we apply the truths in an analogous way to other living beings,
 the contemplation nurtures the growth of good will and harmlessness.
 We see that, like ourselves, all other living beings want to be happy,
 and again that like ourselves they are subject to suffering.
 The consideration that all beings seek happiness causes thoughts of good
 will to arise — the loving wish that they be well, happy, and peaceful.
 The consideration that beings are exposed to suffering causes thoughts
 of harmlessness to arise — the compassionate wish that they be free from
 suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moment the cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path begins, the factors
 of right view and right intention together start to counteract the three
 unwholesome roots.
 Delusion, the primary cognitive defilement, is opposed by right view, the
 nascent seed of wisdom.
 The complete eradication of delusion will only take place when right view
 is developed to the stage of full realization, but every flickering of
 correct understanding contributes to its eventual destruction.
 The other two roots, being emotive defilements, require opposition through
 the redirecting of intention, and thus meet their antidotes in thoughts
 of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since greed and aversion are deeply grounded, they do not yield easily;
 however, the work of overcoming them is not impossible if an effective
 strategy is employed.
 The path devised by the Buddha makes use of an indirect approach: it proceeds
 by tackling the thoughts to which these defilements give rise.
 Greed and aversion surface in the form of thoughts, and thus can be eroded
 by a process of "thought substitution," by replacing them with the thoughts
 opposed to them.
 The intention of renunciation provides the remedy to greed.
 Greed comes to manifestation in thoughts of desire — as sensual, acquisitive,
 and possessive thoughts.
 Thoughts of renunciation spring from the wholesome root of non-greed, which
 they activate whenever they are cultivated.
 Since contrary thoughts cannot coexist, when thoughts of renunciation are
 roused, they dislodge thoughts of desire, thus causing non-greed to replace
 greed.
 Similarly, the intentions of good will and harmlessness offer the antidote
 to aversion.
 Aversion comes to manifestation either in thoughts of ill will — as angry,
 hostile, or resentful thoughts; or in thoughts of harming — as the impulses
 to cruelty, aggression, and destruction.
 Thoughts of good will counter the former outflow of aversion, thoughts
 of harmlessness the latter outflow, in this way excising the unwholesome
 root of aversion itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Intention of Renunciation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha describes his teaching as running contrary to the way of the
 world.
 The way of the world is the way of desire, and the unenlightened who follow
 this way flow with the current of desire, seeking happiness by pursuing
 the objects in which they imagine they will find fulfillment.
 The Buddha's message of renunciation states exactly the opposite: the pull
 of desire is to be resisted and eventually abandoned.
 Desire is to be abandoned not because it is morally evil but because it
 is a root of suffering.17 Thus renunciation, turning away from craving and
 its drive for gratification, becomes the key to happiness, to freedom from
 the hold of attachment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha does not demand that everyone leave the household life for the
 monastery or ask his followers to discard all sense enjoyments on the spot.
 The degree to which a person renounces depends on his or her disposition
 and situation.
 But what remains as a guiding principle is this: that the attainment of
 deliverance requires the complete eradication of craving, and progress
 along the path is accelerated to the extent that one overcomes craving.
 Breaking free from domination by desire may not be easy, but the difficulty
 does not abrogate the necessity.
 Since craving is the origin of dukkha, putting an end to dukkha depends
 on eliminating craving, and that involves directing the mind to renunciation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it is just at this point, when one tries to let go of attachment, that
 one encounters a powerful inner resistance.
 The mind does not want to relinquish its hold on the objects to which it
 has become attached.
 For such a long time it has been accustomed to gaining, grasping, and holding,
 that it seems impossible to break these habits by an act of will.
 One might agree to the need for renunciation, might want to leave attachment
 behind, but when the call is actually sounded the mind recoils and continues
 to move in the grip of its desires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the problem arises of how to break the shackles of desire.
 The Buddha does not offer as a solution the method of repression — the
 attempt to drive desire away with a mind full of fear and loathing.
 This approach does not resolve the problem but only pushes it below the
 surface, where it continues to thrive.
 The tool the Buddha holds out to free the mind from desire is understanding.
 Real renunciation is not a matter of compelling ourselves to give up things
 still inwardly cherished, but of changing our perspective on them so that
 they no longer bind us.
 When we understand the nature of desire, when we investigate it closely
 with keen attention, desire falls away by itself, without need for struggle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand desire in such a way that we can loosen its hold, we need
 to see that desire is invariably bound up with dukkha.
 The whole phenomenon of desire, with its cycle of wanting and gratification,
 hangs on our way of seeing things.
 We remain in bondage to desire because we see it as our means to happiness.
 If we can look at desire from a different angle, its force will be abated,
 resulting in the move towards renunciation.
 What is needed to alter perception is something called "wise consideration"
 (yoniso manasikara).
 Just as perception influences thought, so thought can influence perception.
 Our usual perceptions are tinged with "unwise consideration" (ayoniso manasikar
a).
 We ordinarily look only at the surfaces of things, scan them in terms of
 our immediate interests and wants; only rarely do we dig into the roots
 of our involvements or explore their long-range consequences.
 To set this straight calls for wise consideration: looking into the hidden
 undertones to our actions, exploring their results, evaluating the worthiness
 of our goals.
 In this investigation our concern must not be with what is pleasant but
 with what is true.
 We have to be prepared and willing to discover what is true even at the
 cost of our comfort.
 For real security always lies on the side of truth, not on the side of
 comfort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When desire is scrutinized closely, we find that it is constantly shadowed
 by dukkha.
 Sometimes dukkha appears as pain or irritation; often it lies low as a
 constant strain of discontent.
 But the two — desire and dukkha — are inseparable concomitants.
 We can confirm this for ourselves by considering the whole cycle of desire.
 At the moment desire springs up it creates in us a sense of lack, the pain
 of want.
 To end this pain we struggle to fulfill the desire.
 If our effort fails, we experience frustration, disappointment, sometimes
 despair.
 But even the pleasure of success is not unqualified.
 We worry that we might lose the ground we have gained.
 We feel driven to secure our position, to safeguard our territory, to gain
 more, to rise higher, to establish tighter controls.
 The demands of desire seem endless, and each desire demands the eternal:
 it wants the things we get to last forever.
 But all the objects of desire are impermanent.
 Whether it be wealth, power, position, or other persons, separation is
 inevitable, and the pain that accompanies separation is proportional to
 the force of attachment: strong attachment brings much suffering; little
 attachment brings little suffering; no attachment brings no suffering.18
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contemplating the dukkha inherent in desire is one way to incline the mind
 to renunciation.
 Another way is to contemplate directly the benefits flowing from renunciation.
 To move from desire to renunciation is not, as might be imagined, to move
 from happiness to grief, from abundance to destitution.
 It is to pass from gross, entangling pleasures to an exalted happiness
 and peace, from a condition of servitude to one of self-mastery.
 Desire ultimately breeds fear and sorrow, but renunciation gives fearlessness
 and joy.
 It promotes the accomplishment of all three stages of the threefold training:
 it purifies conduct, aids concentration, and nourishes the seed of wisdom.
 The entire course of practice from start to finish can in fact be seen
 as an evolving process of renunciation culminating in Nibbana as the ultimate
 stage of relinquishment, "the relinquishing of all foundations of existence"
 (sabb'upadhipatinissagga).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we methodically contemplate the dangers of desire and the benefits
 of renunciation, gradually we steer our mind away from the domination of
 desire.
 Attachments are shed like the leaves of a tree, naturally and spontaneously.
 The changes do not come suddenly, but when there is persistent practice,
 there is no doubt that they will come.
 Through repeated contemplation one thought knocks away another, the intention
 of renunciation dislodges the intention of desire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Intention of Good Will
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intention of good will opposes the intention of ill will, thoughts governed
 by anger and aversion.
 As in the case of desire, there are two ineffective ways of handling ill
 will.
 One is to yield to it, to express the aversion by bodily or verbal action.
 This approach releases the tension, helps drive the anger "out of one's
 system," but it also poses certain dangers.
 It breeds resentment, provokes retaliation, creates enemies, poisons relationsh
ips, and generates unwholesome kamma; in the end, the ill will does not
 leave the "system" after all, but instead is driven down to a deeper level
 where it continues to vitiate one's thoughts and conduct.
 The other approach, repression, also fails to dispel the destructive force
 of ill will.
 It merely turns that force around and pushes it inward, where it becomes
 transmogrified into self-contempt, chronic depression, or a tendency to
 irrational outbursts of violence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remedy the Buddha recommends to counteract ill will, especially when
 the object is another person, is a quality called in Pali metta.
 This word derives from another word meaning "friend," but metta signifies
 much more than ordinary friendliness.
 I prefer to translate it by the compound "loving-kindness," which best
 captures the intended sense: an intense feeling of selfless love for other
 beings radiating outwards as a heartfelt concern for their well-being and
 happiness.
 Metta is not just sentimental good will, nor is it a conscientious response
 to a moral imperative or divine command.
 It must become a deep inner feeling, characterized by spontaneous warmth
 rather than by a sense of obligation.
 At its peak metta rises to the heights of a brahmavihara, a "divine dwelling,"
 a total way of being centered on the radiant wish for the welfare of all
 living beings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kind of love implied by metta should be distinguished from sensual love
 as well as from the love involved in personal affection.
 The first is a form of craving, necessarily self-directed, while the second
 still includes a degree of attachment: we love a person because that person
 gives us pleasure, belongs to our family or group, or reinforces our own
 self-image.
 Only rarely does the feeling of affection transcend all traces of ego-reference
, and even then its scope is limited.
 It applies only to a certain person or group of people while excluding
 others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The love involved in metta, in contrast, does not hinge on particular relations
 to particular persons.
 Here the reference point of self is utterly omitted.
 We are concerned only with suffusing others with a mind of loving-kindness,
 which ideally is to be developed into a universal state, extended to all
 living beings without discriminations or reservations.
 The way to impart to metta this universal scope is to cultivate it as an
 exercise in meditation.
 Spontaneous feelings of good will occur too sporadically and are too limited
 in range to be relied on as the remedy for aversion.
 The idea of deliberately developing love has been criticized as contrived,
 mechanical, and calculated.
 Love, it is said, can only be genuine when it is spontaneous, arisen without
 inner prompting or effort.
 But it is a Buddhist thesis that the mind cannot be commanded to love spontaneo
usly; it can only be shown the means to develop love and enjoined to practice
 accordingly.
 At first the means has to be employed with some deliberation, but through
 practice the feeling of love becomes ingrained, grafted onto the mind as
 a natural and spontaneous tendency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of development is metta-bhavana, the meditation on loving-kindness,
 one of the most important kinds of Buddhist meditation.
 The meditation begins with the development of loving-kindness towards oneself.19
 It is suggested that one take oneself as the first object of metta because
 true loving-kindness for others only becomes possible when one is able
 to feel genuine loving-kindness for oneself.
 Probably most of the anger and hostility we direct to others springs from
 negative attitudes we hold towards ourselves.
 When metta is directed inwards towards oneself, it helps to melt down the
 hardened crust created by these negative attitudes, permitting a fluid
 diffusion of kindness and sympathy outwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once one has learned to kindle the feeling of metta towards oneself, the
 next step is to extend it to others.
 The extension of metta hinges on a shift in the sense of identity, on expanding
 the sense of identity beyond its ordinary confines and learning to identify
 with others.
 The shift is purely psychological in method, entirely free from theological
 and metaphysical postulates, such as that of a universal self immanent
 in all beings.
 Instead, it proceeds from a simple, straightforward course of reflection
 which enables us to share the subjectivity of others and experience the
 world (at least imaginatively) from the standpoint of their own inwardness.
 The procedure starts with oneself.
 If we look into our own mind, we find that the basic urge of our being
 is the wish to be happy and free from suffering.
 Now, as soon as we see this in ourselves, we can immediately understand
 that all living beings share the same basic wish.
 All want to be well, happy, and secure.
 To develop metta towards others, what is to be done is to imaginatively
 share their own innate wish for happiness.
 We use our own desire for happiness as the key, experience this desire
 as the basic urge of others, then come back to our own position and extend
 to them the wish that they may achieve their ultimate objective, that they
 may be well and happy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The methodical radiation of metta is practiced first by directing metta
 to individuals representing certain groups.
 These groups are set in an order of progressive remoteness from oneself.
 The radiation begins with a dear person, such as a parent or teacher, then
 moves on to a friend, then to a neutral person, then finally to a hostile
 person.
 Though the types are defined by their relation to oneself, the love to
 be developed is not based on that relation but on each person's common
 aspiration for happiness.
 With each individual one has to bring his (or her) image into focus and
 radiate the thought: "May he (she) be well! May he (she) be happy! May
 he (she) be peaceful!"20 Only when one succeeds in generating a warm feeling
 of good will and kindness towards that person should one turn to the next.
 Once one gains some success with individuals, one can then work with larger
 units.
 One can try developing metta towards all friends, all neutral persons,
 all hostile persons.
 Then metta can be widened by directional suffusion, proceeding in the various
 directions — east, south, west, north, above, below — then it can be extended
 to all beings without distinction.
 In the end one suffuses the entire world with a mind of loving-kindness
 "vast, sublime, and immeasurable, without enmity, without aversion."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Intention of Harmlessness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intention of harmlessness is thought guided by compassion (karuna),
 aroused in opposition to cruel, aggressive, and violent thoughts.
 Compassion supplies the complement to loving-kindness.
 Whereas loving-kindness has the characteristic of wishing for the happiness
 and welfare of others, compassion has the characteristic of wishing that
 others be free from suffering, a wish to be extended without limits to
 all living beings.
 Like metta, compassion arises by entering into the subjectivity of others,
 by sharing their interiority in a deep and total way.
 It springs up by considering that all beings, like ourselves, wish to be
 free from suffering, yet despite their wishes continue to be harassed by
 pain, fear, sorrow, and other forms of dukkha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To develop compassion as a meditative exercise, it is most effective to
 start with somebody who is actually undergoing suffering, since this provides
 the natural object for compassion.
 One contemplates this person's suffering, either directly or imaginatively,
 then reflects that like oneself, he (she) also wants to be free from suffering.
 The thought should be repeated, and contemplation continually exercised,
 until a strong feeling of compassion swells up in the heart.
 Then, using that feeling as a standard, one turns to different individuals,
 considers how they are each exposed to suffering, and radiates the gentle
 feeling of compassion out to them.
 To increase the breadth and intensity of compassion it is helpful to contemplat
e the various sufferings to which living beings are susceptible.
 A useful guideline to this extension is provided by the first noble truth,
 with its enumeration of the different aspects of dukkha.
 One contemplates beings as subject to old age, then as subject to sickness,
 then to death, then to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, and
 so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a high level of success has been achieved in generating compassion
 by the contemplation of beings who are directly afflicted by suffering,
 one can then move on to consider people who are presently enjoying happiness
 which they have acquired by immoral means.
 One might reflect that such people, despite their superficial fortune,
 are doubtlessly troubled deep within by the pangs of conscience.
 Even if they display no outward signs of inner distress, one knows that
 they will eventually reap the bitter fruits of their evil deeds, which
 will bring them intense suffering.
 Finally, one can widen the scope of one's contemplation to include all
 living beings.
 One should contemplate all beings as subject to the universal suffering
 of samsara, driven by their greed, aversion, and delusion through the round
 of repeated birth and death.
 If compassion is initially difficult to arouse towards beings who are total
 strangers, one can strengthen it by reflecting on the Buddha's dictum that
 in this beginningless cycle of rebirths, it is hard to find even a single
 being who has not at some time been one's own mother or father, sister
 or brother, son or daughter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, we see that the three kinds of right intention — of renunciation,
 good will, and harmlessness — counteract the three wrong intentions of
 desire, ill will, and harmfulness.
 The importance of putting into practice the contemplations leading to the
 arising of these thoughts cannot be overemphasized.
 The contemplations have been taught as methods for cultivation, not mere
 theoretical excursions.
 To develop the intention of renunciation we have to contemplate the suffering
 tied up with the quest for worldly enjoyment; to develop the intention
 of good will we have to consider how all beings desire happiness; to develop
 the intention of harmlessness we have to consider how all beings wish to
 be free from suffering.
 The unwholesome thought is like a rotten peg lodged in the mind; the wholesome
 thought is like a new peg suitable to replace it.
 The actual contemplation functions as the hammer used to drive out the
 old peg with the new one.
 The work of driving in the new peg is practice — practicing again and again,
 as often as is necessary to reach success.
 The Buddha gives us his assurance that the victory can be achieved.
 He says that whatever one reflects upon frequently becomes the inclination
 of the mind.
 If one frequently thinks sensual, hostile, or harmful thoughts, desire,
 ill will, and harmfulness become the inclination of the mind.
 If one frequently thinks in the opposite way, renunciation, good will,
 and harmlessness become the inclination of the mind (MN 19).
 The direction we take always comes back to ourselves, to the intentions
 we generate moment by moment in the course of our lives.

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter IV: Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood (Samma Vaca, Samma
 Kammanta, Samma Ajiva)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three path factors — right speech, right action, and right livelihood
 — may be treated together, as collectively they make up the first of the
 three divisions of the path, the division of moral discipline (silakkhandha).
 Though the principles laid down in this section restrain immoral actions
 and promote good conduct, their ultimate purpose is not so much ethical
 as spiritual.
 They are not prescribed merely as guides to action, but primarily as aids
 to mental purification.
 As a necessary measure for human well-being, ethics has its own justification
 in the Buddha's teaching and its importance cannot be underrated.
 But in the special context of the Noble Eightfold Path ethical principles
 are subordinate to the path's governing goal, final deliverance from suffering.
 Thus for the moral training to become a proper part of the path, it has
 to be taken up under the tutelage of the first two factors, right view
 and right intention, and to lead beyond to the trainings in concentration
 and wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though the training in moral discipline is listed first among the three
 groups of practices, it should not be regarded lightly.
 It is the foundation for the entire path, essential for the success of
 the other trainings.
 The Buddha himself frequently urged his disciples to adhere to the rules
 of discipline, "seeing danger in the slightest fault." One time, when a
 monk approached the Buddha and asked for the training in brief, the Buddha
 told him: "First establish yourself in the starting point of wholesome
 states, that is, in purified moral discipline and in right view.
 Then, when your moral discipline is purified and your view straight, you
 should practice the four foundations of mindfulness" (SN 47:3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pali word we have been translating as "moral discipline," sila, appears
 in the texts with several overlapping meanings all connected with right
 conduct.
 In some contexts it means action conforming to moral principles, in others
 the principles themselves, in still others the virtuous qualities of character
 that result from the observance of moral principles.
 Sila in the sense of precepts or principles represents the formalistic
 side of the ethical training, sila as virtue the animating spirit, and
 sila as right conduct the expression of virtue in real-life situations.
 Often sila is formally defined as abstinence from unwholesome bodily and
 verbal action.
 This definition, with its stress on outer action, appears superficial.
 Other explanations, however, make up for the deficiency and reveal that
 there is more to sila than is evident at first glance.
 The Abhidhamma, for example, equates sila with the mental factors of abstinence
 (viratiyo) — right speech, right action, and right livelihood — an equation
 which makes it clear that what is really being cultivated through the observanc
e of moral precepts is the mind.
 Thus while the training in sila brings the "public" benefit of inhibiting
 socially detrimental actions, it entails the personal benefit of mental
 purification, preventing the defilements from dictating to us what lines
 of conduct we should follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The English word "morality" and its derivatives suggest a sense of obligation
 and constraint quite foreign to the Buddhist conception of sila; this connotati
on probably enters from the theistic background to Western ethics.
 Buddhism, with its non-theistic framework, grounds its ethics, not on the
 notion of obedience, but on that of harmony.
 In fact, the commentaries explain the word sila by another word, samadhana,
 meaning "harmony" or "coordination."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observance of sila leads to harmony at several levels — social, psychologica
l, kammic, and contemplative.
 At the social level the principles of sila help to establish harmonious
 interpersonal relations, welding the mass of differently constituted members
 of society with their own private interests and goals into a cohesive social
 order in which conflict, if not utterly eliminated, is at least reduced.
 At the psychological level sila brings harmony to the mind, protection
 from the inner split caused by guilt and remorse over moral transgressions.
 At the kammic level the observance of sila ensures harmony with the cosmic
 law of kamma, hence favorable results in the course of future movement
 through the round of repeated birth and death.
 And at the fourth level, the contemplative, sila helps establish the preliminar
y purification of mind to be completed, in a deeper and more thorough way,
 by the methodical development of serenity and insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When briefly defined, the factors of moral training are usually worded negativel
y, in terms of abstinence.
 But there is more to sila than refraining from what is wrong.
 Each principle embedded in the precepts, as we will see, actually has two
 aspects, both essential to the training as a whole.
 One is abstinence from the unwholesome, the other commitment to the wholesome;
 the former is called "avoidance" (varitta) and the latter "performance"
 (caritta).
 At the outset of training the Buddha stresses the aspect of avoidance.
 He does so, not because abstinence from the unwholesome is sufficient in
 itself, but to establish the steps of practice in proper sequence.
 The steps are set out in their natural order (more logical than temporal)
 in the famous dictum of the Dhammapada: "To abstain from all evil, to cultivate
 the good, and to purify one's mind — this is the teaching of the Buddhas"
 (v.
 183).
 The other two steps — cultivating the good and purifying the mind — also
 receive their due, but to ensure their success, a resolve to avoid the
 unwholesome is a necessity.
 Without such a resolve the attempt to develop wholesome qualities is bound
 to issue in a warped and stunted pattern of growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The training in moral discipline governs the two principal channels of outer
 action, speech and body, as well as another area of vital concern — one's
 way of earning a living.
 Thus the training contains three factors: right speech, right action, and
 right livelihood.
 These we will now examine individually, following the order in which they
 are set forth in the usual exposition of the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Speech (samma vaca)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha divides right speech into four components: abstaining from false
 speech, abstaining from slanderous speech, abstaining from harsh speech,
 and abstaining from idle chatter.
 Because the effects of speech are not as immediately evident as those of
 bodily action, its importance and potential is easily overlooked.
 But a little reflection will show that speech and its offshoot, the written
 word, can have enormous consequences for good or for harm.
 In fact, whereas for beings such as animals who live at the preverbal level
 physical action is of dominant concern, for humans immersed in verbal communica
tion speech gains the ascendency.
 Speech can break lives, create enemies, and start wars, or it can give
 wisdom, heal divisions, and create peace.
 This has always been so, yet in the modern age the positive and negative
 potentials of speech have been vastly multiplied by the tremendous increase
 in the means, speed, and range of communications.
 The capacity for verbal expression, oral and written, has often been regarded
 as the distinguishing mark of the human species.
 From this we can appreciate the need to make this capacity the means to
 human excellence rather than, as too often has been the case, the sign
 of human degradation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Abstaining from false speech (musavada veramani)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein someone avoids false speech and abstains from it.
 He speaks the truth, is devoted to truth, reliable, worthy of confidence,
 not a deceiver of people.
 Being at a meeting, or amongst people, or in the midst of his relatives,
 or in a society, or in the king's court, and called upon and asked as witness
 to tell what he knows, he answers, if he knows nothing: "I know nothing,"
 and if he knows, he answers: "I know"; if he has seen nothing, he answers:
 "I have seen nothing," and if he has seen, he answers: "I have seen." Thus
 he never knowingly speaks a lie, either for the sake of his own advantage,
 or for the sake of another person's advantage, or for the sake of any advantage
 whatsoever.21
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This statement of the Buddha discloses both the negative and the positive
 sides to the precept.
 The negative side is abstaining from lying, the positive side speaking
 the truth.
 The determinative factor behind the transgression is the intention to deceive.
 If one speaks something false believing it to be true, there is no breach
 of the precept as the intention to deceive is absent.
 Though the deceptive intention is common to all cases of false speech,
 lies can appear in different guises depending on the motivating root, whether
 greed, hatred, or delusion.
 Greed as the chief motive results in the lie aimed at gaining some personal
 advantage for oneself or for those close to oneself — material wealth,
 position, respect, or admiration.
 With hatred as the motive, false speech takes the form of the malicious
 lie, the lie intended to hurt and damage others.
 When delusion is the principal motive, the result is a less pernicious
 type of falsehood: the irrational lie, the compulsive lie, the interesting
 exaggeration, lying for the sake of a joke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha's stricture against lying rests upon several reasons.
 For one thing, lying is disruptive to social cohesion.
 People can live together in society only in an atmosphere of mutual trust,
 where they have reason to believe that others will speak the truth; by
 destroying the grounds for trust and inducing mass suspicion, widespread
 lying becomes the harbinger signalling the fall from social solidarity
 to chaos.
 But lying has other consequences of a deeply personal nature at least equally
 disastrous.
 By their very nature lies tend to proliferate.
 Lying once and finding our word suspect, we feel compelled to lie again
 to defend our credibility, to paint a consistent picture of events.
 So the process repeats itself: the lies stretch, multiply, and connect
 until they lock us into a cage of falsehoods from which it is difficult
 to escape.
 The lie is thus a miniature paradigm for the whole process of subjective
 illusion.
 In each case the self-assured creator, sucked in by his own deceptions,
 eventually winds up their victim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such considerations probably lie behind the words of counsel the Buddha
 spoke to his son, the young novice Rahula, soon after the boy was ordained.
 One day the Buddha came to Rahula, pointed to a bowl with a little bit
 of water in it, and asked: "Rahula, do you see this bit of water left in
 the bowl?" Rahula answered: "Yes, sir." "So little, Rahula, is the spiritual
 achievement (samañña, lit.
 'recluseship') of one who is not afraid to speak a deliberate lie." Then
 the Buddha threw the water away, put the bowl down, and said: "Do you see,
 Rahula, how that water has been discarded? In the same way one who tells
 a deliberate lie discards whatever spiritual achievement he has made." Again
 he asked: "Do you see how this bowl is now empty? In the same way one who
 has no shame in speaking lies is empty of spiritual achievement." Then the
 Buddha turned the bowl upside down and said: "Do you see, Rahula, how this
 bowl has been turned upside down? In the same way one who tells a deliberate
 lie turns his spiritual achievements upside down and becomes incapable
 of progress." Therefore, the Buddha concluded, one should not speak a deliberate
 lie even in jest.22
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is said that in the course of his long training for enlightenment over
 many lives, a bodhisatta can break all the moral precepts except the pledge
 to speak the truth.
 The reason for this is very profound, and reveals that the commitment to
 truth has a significance transcending the domain of ethics and even mental
 purification, taking us to the domains of knowledge and being.
 Truthful speech provides, in the sphere of interpersonal communication,
 a parallel to wisdom in the sphere of private understanding.
 The two are respectively the outward and inward modalities of the same
 commitment to what is real.
 Wisdom consists in the realization of truth, and truth (sacca) is not just
 a verbal proposition but the nature of things as they are.
 To realize truth our whole being has to be brought into accord with actuality,
 with things as they are, which requires that in communications with others
 we respect things as they are by speaking the truth.
 Truthful speech establishes a correspondence between our own inner being
 and the real nature of phenomena, allowing wisdom to rise up and fathom
 their real nature.
 Thus, much more than an ethical principle, devotion to truthful speech
 is a matter of taking our stand on reality rather than illusion, on the
 truth grasped by wisdom rather than the fantasies woven by desire.

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Abstaining from slanderous speech (pisunaya vacaya veramani)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He avoids slanderous speech and abstains from it.
 What he has heard here he does not repeat there, so as to cause dissension
 there; and what he has heard there he does not repeat here, so as to cause
 dissension here.
 Thus he unites those that are divided; and those that are united he encourages.
 Concord gladdens him, he delights and rejoices in concord; and it is concord
 that he spreads by his words.23
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slanderous speech is speech intended to create enmity and division, to alienate
 one person or group from another.
 The motive behind such speech is generally aversion, resentment of a rival's
 success or virtues, the intention to tear down others by verbal denigrations.
 Other motives may enter the picture as well: the cruel intention of causing
 hurt to others, the evil desire to win affection for oneself, the perverse
 delight in seeing friends divided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slanderous speech is one of the most serious moral transgressions.
 The root of hate makes the unwholesome kamma already heavy enough, but
 since the action usually occurs after deliberation, the negative force
 becomes even stronger because premeditation adds to its gravity.
 When the slanderous statement is false, the two wrongs of falsehood and
 slander combine to produce an extremely powerful unwholesome kamma.
 The canonical texts record several cases in which the calumny of an innocent
 party led to an immediate rebirth in the plane of misery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposite of slander, as the Buddha indicates, is speech that promotes
 friendship and harmony.
 Such speech originates from a mind of loving-kindness and sympathy.
 It wins the trust and affection of others, who feel they can confide in
 one without fear that their disclosures will be used against them.
 Beyond the obvious benefits that such speech brings in this present life,
 it is said that abstaining from slander has as its kammic result the gain
 of a retinue of friends who can never be turned against one by the slanderous
 words of others.24
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Abstaining from harsh speech (pharusaya vacaya veramani).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He avoids harsh language and abstains from it.
 He speaks such words as are gentle, soothing to the ear, loving, such words
 as go to the heart, and are courteous, friendly, and agreeable to many.25
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harsh speech is speech uttered in anger, intended to cause the hearer pain.
 Such speech can assume different forms, of which we might mention three.
 One is abusive speech: scolding, reviling, or reproving another angrily
 with bitter words.
 A second is insult: hurting another by ascribing to him some offensive
 quality which detracts from his dignity.
 A third is sarcasm: speaking to someone in a way which ostensibly lauds
 him, but with such a tone or twist of phrasing that the ironic intent becomes
 clear and causes pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main root of harsh speech is aversion, assuming the form of anger.
 Since the defilement in this case tends to work impulsively, without deliberati
on, the transgression is less serious than slander and the kammic consequence
 generally less severe.
 Still, harsh speech is an unwholesome action with disagreeable results
 for oneself and others, both now and in the future, so it has to be restrained.
 The ideal antidote is patience — learning to tolerate blame and criticism
 from others, to sympathize with their shortcomings, to respect differences
 in viewpoint, to endure abuse without feeling compelled to retaliate.
 The Buddha calls for patience even under the most trying conditions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if, monks, robbers and murderers saw through your limbs and joints,
 whosoever should give way to anger thereat would not be following my advice.
 For thus ought you to train yourselves: "Undisturbed shall our mind remain,
 with heart full of love, and free from any hidden malice; and that person
 shall we penetrate with loving thoughts, wide, deep, boundless, freed from
 anger and hatred."26
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Abstaining from idle chatter (samphappalapa veramani).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He avoids idle chatter and abstains from it.
 He speaks at the right time, in accordance with facts, speaks what is useful,
 speaks of the Dhamma and the discipline; his speech is like a treasure,
 uttered at the right moment, accompanied by reason, moderate and full of
 sense.27
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Idle chatter is pointless talk, speech that lacks purpose or depth.
 Such speech communicates nothing of value, but only stirs up the defilements
 in one's own mind and in others.
 The Buddha advises that idle talk should be curbed and speech restricted
 as much as possible to matters of genuine importance.
 In the case of a monk, the typical subject of the passage just quoted,
 his words should be selective and concerned primarily with the Dhamma.
 Lay persons will have more need for affectionate small talk with friends
 and family, polite conversation with acquaintances, and talk in connection
 with their line of work.
 But even then they should be mindful not to let the conversation stray
 into pastures where the restless mind, always eager for something sweet
 or spicy to feed on, might find the chance to indulge its defiling propensities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional exegesis of abstaining from idle chatter refers only to
 avoiding engagement in such talk oneself.
 But today it might be of value to give this factor a different slant, made
 imperative by certain developments peculiar to our own time, unknown in
 the days of the Buddha and the ancient commentators.
 This is avoiding exposure to the idle chatter constantly bombarding us
 through the new media of communication created by modern technology.
 An incredible array of devices — television, radio, newspapers, pulp journals,
 the cinema — turns out a continuous stream of needless information and
 distracting entertainment the net effect of which is to leave the mind
 passive, vacant, and sterile.
 All these developments, naively accepted as "progress," threaten to blunt
 our aesthetic and spiritual sensitivities and deafen us to the higher call
 of the contemplative life.
 Serious aspirants on the path to liberation have to be extremely discerning
 in what they allow themselves to be exposed to.
 They would greatly serve their aspirations by including these sources of
 amusement and needless information in the category of idle chatter and
 making an effort to avoid them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Action (samma kammanta)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right action means refraining from unwholesome deeds that occur with the
 body as their natural means of expression.
 The pivotal element in this path factor is the mental factor of abstinence,
 but because this abstinence applies to actions performed through the body,
 it is called "right action." The Buddha mentions three components of right
 action: abstaining from taking life, abstaining from taking what is not
 given, and abstaining from sexual misconduct.
 These we will briefly discuss in order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Abstaining from the taking of life (panatipata veramani)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein someone avoids the taking of life and abstains from it.
 Without stick or sword, conscientious, full of sympathy, he is desirous
 of the welfare of all sentient beings.28
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Abstaining from taking life" has a wider application than simply refraining
 from killing other human beings.
 The precept enjoins abstaining from killing any sentient being.
 A "sentient being" (pani, satta) is a living being endowed with mind or
 consciousness; for practical purposes, this means human beings, animals,
 and insects.
 Plants are not considered to be sentient beings; though they exhibit some
 degree of sensitivity, they lack full-fledged consciousness, the defining
 attribute of a sentient being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "taking of life" that is to be avoided is intentional killing, the deliberat
e destruction of life of a being endowed with consciousness.
 The principle is grounded in the consideration that all beings love life
 and fear death, that all seek happiness and are averse to pain.
 The essential determinant of transgression is the volition to kill, issuing
 in an action that deprives a being of life.
 Suicide is also generally regarded as a violation, but not accidental killing
 as the intention to destroy life is absent.
 The abstinence may be taken to apply to two kinds of action, the primary
 and the secondary.
 The primary is the actual destruction of life; the secondary is deliberately
 harming or torturing another being without killing it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Buddha's statement on non-injury is quite simple and straightforward,
 later commentaries give a detailed analysis of the principle.
 A treatise from Thailand, written by an erudite Thai patriarch, collates
 a mass of earlier material into an especially thorough treatment, which
 we shall briefly summarize here.29 The treatise points out that the taking
 of life may have varying degrees of moral weight entailing different consequenc
es.
 The three primary variables governing moral weight are the object, the
 motive, and the effort.
 With regard to the object there is a difference in seriousness between
 killing a human being and killing an animal, the former being kammically
 heavier since man has a more highly developed moral sense and greater spiritual
 potential than animals.
 Among human beings, the degree of kammic weight depends on the qualities
 of the person killed and his relation to the killer; thus killing a person
 of superior spiritual qualities or a personal benefactor, such as a parent
 or a teacher, is an especially grave act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motive for killing also influences moral weight.
 Acts of killing can be driven by greed, hatred, or delusion.
 Of the three, killing motivated by hatred is the most serious, and the
 weight increases to the degree that the killing is premeditated.
 The force of effort involved also contributes, the unwholesome kamma being
 proportional to the force and the strength of the defilements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive counterpart to abstaining from taking life, as the Buddha indicates
, is the development of kindness and compassion for other beings.
 The disciple not only avoids destroying life; he dwells with a heart full
 of sympathy, desiring the welfare of all beings.
 The commitment to non-injury and concern for the welfare of others represent
 the practical application of the second path factor, right intention, in
 the form of good will and harmlessness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Abstaining from taking what is not given (adinnadana veramani)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He avoids taking what is not given and abstains from it; what another person
 possesses of goods and chattel in the village or in the wood, that he does
 not take away with thievish intent.30
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Taking what is not given" means appropriating the rightful belongings of
 others with thievish intent.
 If one takes something that has no owner, such as unclaimed stones, wood,
 or even gems extracted from the earth, the act does not count as a violation
 even though these objects have not been given.
 But also implied as a transgression, though not expressly stated, is withholdin
g from others what should rightfully be given to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commentaries mention a number of ways in which "taking what is not given"
 can be committed.
 Some of the most common may be enumerated:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) stealing: taking the belongings of others secretly, as in housebreaking,
 pickpocketing, etc.;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) robbery: taking what belongs to others openly by force or threats;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) snatching: suddenly pulling away another's possession before he has
 time to resist;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) fraudulence: gaining possession of another's belongings by falsely claiming
 them as one's own;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) deceitfulness: using false weights and measures to cheat customers.31
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degree of moral weight that attaches to the action is determined by
 three factors: the value of the object taken; the qualities of the victim
 of the theft; and the subjective state of the thief.
 Regarding the first, moral weight is directly proportional to the value
 of the object.
 Regarding the second, the weight varies according to the moral qualities
 of the deprived individual.
 Regarding the third, acts of theft may be motivated either by greed or
 hatred.
 While greed is the most common cause, hatred may also be responsible as
 when one person deprives another of his belongings not so much because
 he wants them for himself as because he wants to harm the latter.
 Between the two, acts motivated by hatred are kammically heavier than acts
 motivated by sheer greed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive counterpart to abstaining from stealing is honesty, which implies
 respect for the belongings of others and for their right to use their belonging
s as they wish.
 Another related virtue is contentment, being satisfied with what one has
 without being inclined to increase one's wealth by unscrupulous means.
 The most eminent opposite virtue is generosity, giving away one's own wealth
 and possessions in order to benefit others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Abstaining from sexual misconduct (kamesu miccha-cara veramani)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He avoids sexual misconduct and abstains from it.
 He has no intercourse with such persons as are still under the protection
 of father, mother, brother, sister or relatives, nor with married women,
 nor with female convicts, nor lastly, with betrothed girls.32
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guiding purposes of this precept, from the ethical standpoint, are to
 protect marital relations from outside disruption and to promote trust
 and fidelity within the marital union.
 From the spiritual standpoint it helps curb the expansive tendency of sexual
 desire and thus is a step in the direction of renunciation, which reaches
 its consummation in the observance of celibacy (brahmacariya) binding on
 monks and nuns.
 But for laypeople the precept enjoins abstaining from sexual relations
 with an illicit partner.
 The primary transgression is entering into full sexual union, but all other
 sexual involvements of a less complete kind may be considered secondary
 infringements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main question raised by the precept concerns who is to count as an illicit
 partner.
 The Buddha's statement defines the illicit partner from the perspective
 of the man, but later treatises elaborate the matter for both sexes.33
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a man, three kinds of women are considered illicit partners:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) A woman who is married to another man.
 This includes, besides a woman already married to a man, a woman who is
 not his legal wife but is generally recognized as his consort, who lives
 with him or is kept by him or is in some way acknowledged as his partner.
 All these women are illicit partners for men other than their own husbands.
 This class would also include a woman engaged to another man.
 But a widow or divorced woman is not out of bounds, provided she is not
 excluded for other reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) A woman still under protection.
 This is a girl or woman who is under the protection of her mother, father,
 relatives, or others rightfully entitled to be her guardians.
 This provision rules out elopements or secret marriages contrary to the
 wishes of the protecting party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) A woman prohibited by convention.
 This includes close female relatives forbidden as partners by social tradition,
 nuns and other women under a vow of celibacy, and those prohibited as partners
 by the law of the land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the standpoint of a woman, two kinds of men are considered illicit
 partners:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) For a married woman any man other than her husband is out of bounds.
 Thus a married woman violates the precept if she breaks her vow of fidelity
 to her husband.
 But a widow or divorcee is free to remarry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) For any woman any man forbidden by convention, such as close relatives
 and those under a vow of celibacy, is an illicit partner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides these, any case of forced, violent, or coercive sexual union constitutes
 a transgression.
 But in such a case the violation falls only on the offender, not on the
 one compelled to submit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive virtue corresponding to the abstinence is, for laypeople, marital
 fidelity.
 Husband and wife should each be faithful and devoted to the other, content
 with the relationship, and should not risk a breakup to the union by seeking
 outside partners.
 The principle does not, however, confine sexual relations to the marital
 union.
 It is flexible enough to allow for variations depending on social convention.
 The essential purpose, as was said, is to prevent sexual relations which
 are hurtful to others.
 When mature independent people, though unmarried, enter into a sexual relations
hip through free consent, so long as no other person is intentionally harmed,
 no breach of the training factor is involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ordained monks and nuns, including men and women who have undertaken the
 eight or ten precepts, are obliged to observe celibacy.
 They must abstain not only from sexual misconduct, but from all sexual
 involvements, at least during the period of their vows.
 The holy life at its highest aims at complete purity in thought, word,
 and deed, and this requires turning back the tide of sexual desire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Livelihood (samma ajiva)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right livelihood is concerned with ensuring that one earns one's living
 in a righteous way.
 For a lay disciple the Buddha teaches that wealth should be gained in accordanc
e with certain standards.
 One should acquire it only by legal means, not illegally; one should acquire
 it peacefully, without coercion or violence; one should acquire it honestly,
 not by trickery or deceit; and one should acquire it in ways which do not
 entail harm and suffering for others.34 The Buddha mentions five specific
 kinds of livelihood which bring harm to others and are therefore to be
 avoided: dealing in weapons, in living beings (including raising animals
 for slaughter as well as slave trade and prostitution), in meat production
 and butchery, in poisons, and in intoxicants (AN 5:177).
 He further names several dishonest means of gaining wealth which fall under
 wrong livelihood: practicing deceit, treachery, soothsaying, trickery,
 and usury (MN 117).
 Obviously any occupation that requires violation of right speech and right
 action is a wrong form of livelihood, but other occupations, such as selling
 weapons or intoxicants, may not violate those factors and yet be wrong
 because of their consequences for others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Thai treatise discusses the positive aspects of right livelihood under
 the three convenient headings of rightness regarding actions, rightness
 regarding persons, and rightness regarding objects.35 "Rightness regarding
 actions" means that workers should fulfill their duties diligently and
 conscientiously, not idling away time, claiming to have worked longer hours
 than they did, or pocketing the company's goods.
 "Rightness regarding persons" means that due respect and consideration
 should be shown to employers, employees, colleagues, and customers.
 An employer, for example, should assign his workers chores according to
 their ability, pay them adequately, promote them when they deserve a promotion
 and give them occasional vacations and bonuses.
 Colleagues should try to cooperate rather than compete, while merchants
 should be equitable in their dealings with customers.
 "Rightness regarding objects" means that in business transactions and sales
 the articles to be sold should be presented truthfully.
 There should be no deceptive advertising, misrepresentations of quality
 or quantity, or dishonest manoeuvers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter V: Right Effort (Samma Vayama)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purification of conduct established by the prior three factors serves
 as the basis for the next division of the path, the division of concentration
 (samadhikkhandha).
 This present phase of practice, which advances from moral restraint to
 direct mental training, comprises the three factors of right effort, right
 mindfulness, and right concentration.
 It gains its name from the goal to which it aspires, the power of sustained
 concentration, itself required as the support for insight-wisdom.
 Wisdom is the primary tool for deliverance, but the penetrating vision
 it yields can only open up when the mind has been composed and collected.
 Right concentration brings the requisite stillness to the mind by unifying
 it with undistracted focus on a suitable object.
 To do so, however, the factor of concentration needs the aid of effort
 and mindfulness.
 Right effort provides the energy demanded by the task, right mindfulness
 the steadying points for awareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commentators illustrate the interdependence of the three factors within
 the concentration group with a simple simile.
 Three boys go to a park to play.
 While walking along they see a tree with flowering tops and decide they
 want to gather the flowers.
 But the flowers are beyond the reach even of the tallest boy.
 Then one friend bends down and offers his back.
 The tall boy climbs up, but still hesitates to reach for the flowers from
 fear of falling.
 So the third boy comes over and offers his shoulder for support.
 The first boy, standing on the back of the second boy, then leans on the
 shoulder of the third boy, reaches up, and gathers the flowers.36
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this simile the tall boy who picks the flowers represents concentration
 with its function of unifying the mind.
 But to unify the mind concentration needs support: the energy provided
 by right effort, which is like the boy who offers his back.
 It also requires the stabilizing awareness provided by mindfulness, which
 is like the boy who offers his shoulder.
 When right concentration receives this support, then empowered by right
 effort and balanced by right mindfulness it can draw in the scattered strands
 of thought and fix the mind firmly on its object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Energy (viriya), the mental factor behind right effort, can appear in either
 wholesome or unwholesome forms.
 The same factor fuels desire, aggression, violence, and ambition on the
 one hand, and generosity, self-discipline, kindness, concentration, and
 understanding on the other.
 The exertion involved in right effort is a wholesome form of energy, but
 it is something more specific, namely, the energy in wholesome states of
 consciousness directed to liberation from suffering.
 This last qualifying phrase is especially important.
 For wholesome energy to become a contributor to the path it has to be guided
 by right view and right intention, and to work in association with the
 other path factors.
 Otherwise, as the energy in ordinary wholesome states of mind, it merely
 engenders an accumulation of merit that ripens within the round of birth
 and death; it does not issue in liberation from the round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time and again the Buddha has stressed the need for effort, for diligence,
 exertion, and unflagging perseverance.
 The reason why effort is so crucial is that each person has to work out
 his or her own deliverance.
 The Buddha does what he can by pointing out the path to liberation; the
 rest involves putting the path into practice, a task that demands energy.
 This energy is to be applied to the cultivation of the mind, which forms
 the focus of the entire path.
 The starting point is the defiled mind, afflicted and deluded; the goal
 is the liberated mind, purified and illuminated by wisdom.
 What comes in between is the unremitting effort to transform the defiled
 mind into the liberated mind.
 The work of self-cultivation is not easy — there is no one who can do it
 for us but ourselves — but it is not impossible.
 The Buddha himself and his accomplished disciples provide the living proof
 that the task is not beyond our reach.
 They assure us, too, that anyone who follows the path can accomplish the
 same goal.
 But what is needed is effort, the work of practice taken up with the determinat
ion: "I shall not give up my efforts until I have attained whatever is attainabl
e by manly perseverance, energy, and endeavor."37
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of the mental process effects a division of right effort into
 four "great endeavors":
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unwholesome states (akusala dhamma) are the defilements, and the thoughts,
 emotions, and intentions derived from them, whether breaking forth into
 action or remaining confined within.
 The wholesome states (kusala dhamma) are states of mind untainted by defilement
s, especially those conducing to deliverance.
 Each of the two kinds of mental states imposes a double task.
 The unwholesome side requires that the defilements lying dormant be prevented
 from erupting and that the active defilements already present be expelled.
 The wholesome side requires that the undeveloped liberating factors first
 be brought into being, then persistently developed to the point of full
 maturity.
 Now we will examine each of these four divisions of right effort, giving
 special attention to their most fertile field of application, the cultivation
 of the mind through meditation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) To prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein the disciple rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil, unwholesome
 states that have not yet arisen; and he makes effort, stirs up his energy,
 exerts his mind and strives.38
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first side of right effort aims at overcoming unwholesome states, states
 of mind tainted by defilements.
 Insofar as they impede concentration the defilements are usually presented
 in a fivefold set called the "five hindrances" (pañcanivarana): sensual
 desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and
 doubt.39 They receive the name "hindrances" because they block the path
 to liberation; they grow up and over the mind preventing calm and insight,
 the primary instruments for progress.
 The first two hindrances, sensual desire and ill will, are the strongest
 of the set, the most formidable barriers to meditative growth, representing,
 respectively, the unwholesome roots of greed and aversion.
 The other three hindrances, less toxic but still obstructive, are offshoots
 of delusion, usually in association with other defilements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sensual desire is interpreted in two ways.
 Sometimes it is understood in a narrow sense as lust for the "five strands
 of sense pleasure," i.e., agreeable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches;
 sometimes a broader interpretation is given, by which the term becomes
 inclusive of craving in all its modes, whether for sense pleasures, wealth,
 power, position, fame, or anything else it can settle upon.
 The second hindrance, ill will, is a synonym for aversion.
 It comprises hatred, anger, resentment, repulsion of every shade, whether
 directed towards other people, towards oneself, towards objects, or towards
 situations.
 The third hindrance, dullness and drowsiness, is a compound of two factors
 linked together by their common feature of mental unwieldiness.
 One is dullness (thina), manifest as mental inertia; the other is drowsiness
 (middha), seen in mental sinking, heaviness of mind, or excessive inclination
 to sleep.
 At the opposite extreme is the fourth hindrance, restlessness and worry.
 This too is a compound with its two members linked by their common feature
 of disquietude.
 Restlessness (uddhacca) is agitation or excitement, which drives the mind
 from thought to thought with speed and frenzy; worry (kukkucca) is remorse
 over past mistakes and anxiety about their possible undesired consequences.
 The fifth hindrance, doubt, signifies a chronic indecisiveness and lack
 of resolution: not the probing of critical intelligence, an attitude encouraged
 by the Buddha, but a persistent inability to commit oneself to the course
 of spiritual training due to lingering doubts concerning the Buddha, his
 doctrine, and his path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first effort to be made regarding the hindrances is the effort to prevent
 the unarisen hindrances from arising; this is also called the endeavor
 to restrain (samvarappadhana).
 The effort to hold the hindrances in check is imperative both at the start
 of meditative training and throughout the course of its development.
 For when the hindrances arise, they disperse attention and darken the quality
 of awareness, to the detriment of calm and clarity.
 The hindrances do not come from outside the mind but from within.
 They appear through the activation of certain tendencies constantly lying
 dormant in the deep recesses of the mental continuum, awaiting the opportunity
 to surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally what sparks the hindrances into activity is the input afforded
 by sense experience.
 The physical organism is equipped with five sense faculties each receptive
 to its own specific kind of data — the eye to forms, the ear to sounds,
 the nose to smells, the tongue to tastes, the body to tangibles.
 Sense objects continuously impinge on the senses, which relay the information
 they receive to the mind, where it is processed, evaluated, and accorded
 an appropriate response.
 But the mind can deal with the impressions it receives in different ways,
 governed in the first place by the manner in which it attends to them.
 When the mind adverts to the incoming data carelessly, with unwise consideratio
n (ayoniso manasikara), the sense objects tend to stir up unwholesome states.
 They do this either directly, through their immediate impact, or else indirectl
y by depositing memory traces which later may swell up as the objects of
 defiled thoughts, images, and fantasies.
 As a general rule the defilement that is activated corresponds to the object:
 attractive objects provoke desire, disagreeable objects provoke ill will,
 and indeterminate objects provoke the defilements connected with delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since an uncontrolled response to the sensory input stimulates the latent
 defilements, what is evidently needed to prevent them from arising is control
 over the senses.
 Thus the Buddha teaches, as the discipline for keeping the hindrances in
 check, an exercise called the restraint of the sense faculties (indriya-samvara
):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he perceives a form with the eye, a sound with the ear, an odor with
 the nose, a taste with the tongue, an impression with the body, or an object
 with the mind, he apprehends neither the sign nor the particulars.
 And he strives to ward off that through which evil and unwholesome states,
 greed and sorrow, would arise, if he remained with unguarded senses; and
 he watches over his senses, restrains his senses.40
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restraint of the senses does not mean denial of the senses, retreating into
 a total withdrawal from the sensory world.
 This is impossible, and even if it could be achieved, the real problem
 would still not be solved; for the defilements lie in the mind, not in
 the sense organs or objects.
 The key to sense control is indicated by the phrase "not apprehending the
 sign or the particulars." The "sign" (nimitta) is the object's general appearanc
e insofar as this appearance is grasped as the basis for defiled thoughts;
 the "particulars" (anubyanjana) are its less conspicuous features.
 If sense control is lacking, the mind roams recklessly over the sense fields.
 First it grasps the sign, which sets the defilements into motion, then
 it explores the particulars, which permits them to multiply and thrive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To restrain the senses requires that mindfulness and clear understanding
 be applied to the encounter with the sense fields.
 Sense consciousness occurs in a series, as a sequence of momentary cognitive
 acts each having its own special task.
 The initial stages in the series occur as automatic functions: first the
 mind adverts to the object, then apprehends it, then admits the percept,
 examines it, and identifies it.
 Immediately following the identification a space opens up in which there
 occurs a free evaluation of the object leading to the choice of a response.
 When mindfulness is absent the latent defilements, pushing for an opportunity
 to emerge, will motivate a wrong consideration.
 One will grasp the sign of the object, explore its details, and thereby
 give the defilements their opportunity: on account of greed one will become
 fascinated by an agreeable object, on account of aversion one will be repelled
 by a disagreeable object.
 But when one applies mindfulness to the sensory encounter, one nips the
 cognitive process in the bud before it can evolve into the stages that
 stimulate the dormant taints.
 Mindfulness holds the hindrances in check by keeping the mind at the level
 of what is sensed.
 It rivets awareness on the given, preventing the mind from embellishing
 the datum with ideas born of greed, aversion, and delusion.
 Then, with this lucent awareness as a guide, the mind can proceed to comprehend
 the object as it is, without being led astray.

(2) To abandon the arisen unwholesome states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein the disciple rouses his will to overcome the evil, unwholesome states
 that have already arisen and he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts
 his mind and strives.41
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the effort at sense control the defilements may still surface.
 They swell up from the depths of the mental continuum, from the buried
 strata of past accumulations, to congeal into unwholesome thoughts and
 emotions.
 When this happens a new kind of effort becomes necessary, the effort to
 abandon arisen unwholesome states, called for short the endeavor to abandon
 (pahanappadhana):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He does not retain any thought of sensual lust, ill will, or harmfulness,
 or any other evil and unwholesome states that may have arisen; he abandons
 them, dispels them, destroys them, causes them to disappear.42
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as a skilled physician has different medicines for different ailments,
 so the Buddha has different antidotes for the different hindrances, some
 equally applicable to all, some geared to a particular hindrance.
 In an important discourse the Buddha explains five techniques for expelling
 distracting thoughts.43 The first is to expel the defiled thought with a
 wholesome thought which is its exact opposite, analogous to the way a carpenter
 might use a new peg to drive out an old one.
 For each of the five hindrances there is a specific remedy, a line of meditatio
n designed expressly to deflate it and destroy it.
 This remedy can be applied intermittently, when a hindrance springs up
 and disrupts meditation on the primary subject; or it can be taken as a
 primary subject itself, used to counter a defilement repeatedly seen to
 be a persistent obstacle to one's practice.
 But for the antidote to become effective in the first role, as a temporary
 expedient required by the upsurge of a hindrance, it is best to gain some
 familiarity with it by making it a primary object, at least for short periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For desire a remedy of general application is the meditation on impermanence,
 which knocks away the underlying prop of clinging, the implicit assumption
 that the objects clung to are stable and durable.
 For desire in the specific form of sensual lust the most potent antidote
 is the contemplation of the unattractive nature of the body, to be dealt
 with at greater length in the next chapter.
 Ill will meets its proper remedy in the meditation on loving-kindness (metta),
 which banishes all traces of hatred and anger through the methodical radiation
 of the altruistic wish that all beings be well and happy.
 The dispelling of dullness and drowsiness calls for a special effort to
 arouse energy, for which several methods are suggested: the visualization
 of a brilliant ball of light, getting up and doing a period of brisk walking
 meditation, reflection on death, or simply making a firm determination
 to continue striving.
 Restlessness and worry are most effectively countered by turning the mind
 to a simple object that tends to calm it down; the method usually recommended
 is mindfulness of breathing, attention to the in-and-out flow of the breath.
 In the case of doubt the special remedy is investigation: to make inquiries,
 ask questions, and study the teachings until the obscure points become
 clear.44
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereas this first of the five methods for expelling the hindrances involves
 a one-to-one alignment between a hindrance and its remedy, the other four
 utilize general approaches.
 The second marshals the forces of shame (hiri) and moral dread (ottappa)
 to abandon the unwanted thought: one reflects on the thought as vile and
 ignoble or considers its undesirable consequences until an inner revulsion
 sets in which drives the thought away.
 The third method involves a deliberate diversion of attention.
 When an unwholesome thought arises and clamours to be noticed, instead
 of indulging it one simply shuts it out by redirecting one's attention
 elsewhere, as if closing one's eyes or looking away to avoid an unpleasant
 sight.
 The fourth method uses the opposite approach.
 Instead of turning away from the unwanted thought, one confronts it directly
 as an object, scrutinizes its features, and investigates its source.
 When this is done the thought quiets down and eventually disappears.
 For an unwholesome thought is like a thief: it only creates trouble when
 its operation is concealed, but put under observation it becomes tame.
 The fifth method, to be used only as a last resort, is suppression — vigorously
 restraining the unwholesome thought with the power of the will in the way
 a strong man might throw a weaker man to the ground and keep him pinned
 there with his weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By applying these five methods with skill and discretion, the Buddha says,
 one becomes a master of all the pathways of thought.
 One is no longer the subject of the mind but its master.
 Whatever thought one wants to think, that one will think.
 Whatever thought one does not want to think, that one will not think.
 Even if unwholesome thoughts occasionally arise, one can dispel them immediatel
y, just as quickly as a red-hot pan will turn to steam a few chance drops
 of water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) To arouse unarisen wholesome states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein the disciple rouses his will to arouse wholesome states that have
 not yet arisen; and he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind
 and strives.45
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simultaneously with the removal of defilements, right effort also imposes
 the task of cultivating wholesome states of mind.
 This involves two divisions: the arousing of wholesome states not yet arisen
 and the maturation of wholesome states already arisen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first of the two divisions is also known as the endeavor to develop
 (bhavanappadhana).
 Though the wholesome states to be developed can be grouped in various ways
 — serenity and insight, the four foundations of mindfulness, the eight
 factors of the path, etc.
 — the Buddha lays special stress on a set called the seven factors of enlighten
ment (satta bojjhanga): mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy,
 rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus he develops the factors of enlightenment, based on solitude, on detachment,
 on cessation, and ending in deliverance, namely: the enlightenment factors
 of mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, rapture, tranquillity,
 concentration, and equanimity.46
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seven states are grouped together as "enlightenment factors" both because
 they lead to enlightenment and because they constitute enlightenment.
 In the preliminary stages of the path they prepare the way for the great
 realization; in the end they remain as its components.
 The experience of enlightenment, perfect and complete understanding, is
 just these seven components working in unison to break all shackles and
 bring final release from sorrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way to enlightenment starts with mindfulness.
 Mindfulness clears the ground for insight into the nature of things by
 bringing to light phenomena in the now, the present moment, stripped of
 all subjective commentary, interpretations, and projections.
 Then, when mindfulness has brought the bare phenomena into focus, the factor
 of investigation steps in to search out their characteristics, conditions,
 and consequences.
 Whereas mindfulness is basically receptive, investigation is an active
 factor which unflinchingly probes, analyzes, and dissects phenomena to
 uncover their fundamental structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work of investigation requires energy, the third factor of enlightenment,
 which mounts in three stages.
 The first, inceptive energy, shakes off lethargy and arouses initial enthusiasm.
 As the work of contemplation advances, energy gathers momentum and enters
 the second stage, perseverance, wherein it propels the practice without
 slackening.
 Finally, at the peak, energy reaches the third stage, invincibility, where
 it drives contemplation forward leaving the hindrances powerless to stop
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As energy increases, the fourth factor of enlightenment is quickened.
 This is rapture, a pleasurable interest in the object.
 Rapture gradually builds up, ascending to ecstatic heights: waves of bliss
 run through the body, the mind glows with joy, fervor and confidence intensify.
 But these experiences, as encouraging as they are, still contain a flaw:
 they create an excitation verging on restlessness.
 With further practice, however, rapture subsides and a tone of quietness
 sets in signalling the rise of the fifth factor, tranquillity.
 Rapture remains present, but it is now subdued, and the work of contemplation
 proceeds with self-possessed serenity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tranquillity brings to ripeness concentration, the sixth factor, one-pointed
 unification of mind.
 Then, with the deepening of concentration, the last enlightenment factor
 comes into dominance.
 This is equanimity, inward poise and balance free from the two defects
 of excitement and inertia.
 When inertia prevails, energy must be aroused; when excitement prevails,
 it is necessary to exercise restraint.
 But when both defects have been vanquished the practice can unfold evenly
 without need for concern.
 The mind of equanimity is compared to the driver of a chariot when the
 horses are moving at a steady pace: he neither has to urge them forward
 nor to hold them back, but can just sit comfortably and watch the scenery
 go by.
 Equanimity has the same "on-looking" quality.
 When the other factors are balanced the mind remains poised watching the
 play of phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) To maintain arisen wholesome states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein the disciple rouses his will to maintain the wholesome things that
 have already arisen, and not to allow them to disappear, but to bring them
 to growth, to maturity, and to the full perfection of development; and
 he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives.47
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last of the four right efforts aims at maintaining the arisen wholesome
 factors and bringing them to maturity.
 Called the "endeavor to maintain" (anurakkhanappadhana), it is explained
 as the effort to "keep firmly in the mind a favorable object of concentration
 that has arisen."48 The work of guarding the object causes the seven enlightenme
nt factors to gain stability and gradually increase in strength until they
 issue in the liberating realization.
 This marks the culmination of right effort, the goal in which the countless
 individual acts of exertion finally reach fulfillment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter VI: Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha says that the Dhamma, the ultimate truth of things, is directly
 visible, timeless, calling out to be approached and seen.
 He says further that it is always available to us, and that the place where
 it is to be realized is within oneself.49 The ultimate truth, the Dhamma,
 is not something mysterious and remote, but the truth of our own experience.
 It can be reached only by understanding our experience, by penetrating
 it right through to its foundations.
 This truth, in order to become liberating truth, has to be known directly.
 It is not enough merely to accept it on faith, to believe it on the authority
 of books or a teacher, or to think it out through deductions and inferences.
 It has to be known by insight, grasped and absorbed by a kind of knowing
 which is also an immediate seeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What brings the field of experience into focus and makes it accessible to
 insight is a mental faculty called in Pali sati, usually translated as
 "mindfulness." Mindfulness is presence of mind, attentiveness or awareness.
 Yet the kind of awareness involved in mindfulness differs profoundly from
 the kind of awareness at work in our usual mode of consciousness.
 All consciousness involves awareness in the sense of a knowing or experiencing
 of an object.
 But with the practice of mindfulness awareness is applied at a special
 pitch.
 The mind is deliberately kept at the level of bare attention, a detached
 observation of what is happening within us and around us in the present
 moment.
 In the practice of right mindfulness the mind is trained to remain in the
 present, open, quiet, and alert, contemplating the present event.
 All judgments and interpretations have to be suspended, or if they occur,
 just registered and dropped.
 The task is simply to note whatever comes up just as it is occurring, riding
 the changes of events in the way a surfer rides the waves on the sea.
 The whole process is a way of coming back into the present, of standing
 in the here and now without slipping away, without getting swept away by
 the tides of distracting thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be assumed that we are always aware of the present, but this is
 a mirage.
 Only seldom do we become aware of the present in the precise way required
 by the practice of mindfulness.
 In ordinary consciousness the mind begins a cognitive process with some
 impression given in the present, but it does not stay with it.
 Instead it uses the immediate impression as a springboard for building
 blocks of mental constructs which remove it from the sheer facticity of
 the datum.
 The cognitive process is generally interpretative.
 The mind perceives its object free from conceptualization only briefly.
 Then, immediately after grasping the initial impression, it launches on
 a course of ideation by which it seeks to interpret the object to itself,
 to make it intelligible in terms of its own categories and assumptions.
 To bring this about the mind posits concepts, joins the concepts into construct
s — sets of mutually corroborative concepts — then weaves the constructs
 together into complex interpretative schemes.
 In the end the original direct experience has been overrun by ideation
 and the presented object appears only dimly through dense layers of ideas
 and views, like the moon through a layer of clouds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha calls this process of mental construction papañca, "elaboration,"
 "embellishment," or "conceptual proliferation." The elaborations block out
 the presentational immediacy of phenomena; they let us know the object
 only "at a distance," not as it really is.
 But the elaborations do not only screen cognition; they also serve as a
 basis for projections.
 The deluded mind, cloaked in ignorance, projects its own internal constructs
 outwardly, ascribing them to the object as if they really belonged to it.
 As a result, what we know as the final object of cognition, what we use
 as the basis for our values, plans, and actions, is a patchwork product,
 not the original article.
 To be sure, the product is not wholly illusion, not sheer fantasy.
 It takes whatis given in immediate experience as its groundwork and raw
 material, but along with this it includes something else: the embellishments
 fabricated by the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The springs for this process of fabrication, hidden from view, are the latent
 defilements.
 The defilements create the embellishments, project them outwardly, and
 use them as hooks for coming to the surface, where they cause further distortio
n.
 To correct the erroneous notions is the task of wisdom, but for wisdom
 to discharge its work effectively, it needs direct access to the object
 as it is in itself, uncluttered by the conceptual elaborations.
 The task of right mindfulness is to clear up the cognitive field.
 Mindfulness brings to light experience in its pure immediacy.
 It reveals the object as it is before it has been plastered over with conceptua
l paint, overlaid with interpretations.
 To practice mindfulness is thus a matter not so much of doing but of undoing:
 not thinking, not judging, not associating, not planning, not imagining,
 not wishing.
 All these "doings" of ours are modes of interference, ways the mind manipulates
 experience and tries to establish its dominance.
 Mindfulness undoes the knots and tangles of these "doings" by simply noting.
 It does nothing but note, watching each occasion of experience as it arises,
 stands, and passes away.
 In the watching there is no room for clinging, no compulsion to saddle
 things with our desires.
 There is only a sustained contemplation of experience in its bare immediacy,
 carefully and precisely and persistently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness exercises a powerful grounding function.
 It anchors the mind securely in the present, so it does not float away
 into the past and future with their memories, regrets, fears, and hopes.
 The mind without mindfulness is sometimes compared to a pumpkin, the mind
 established in mindfulness to a stone.50 A pumpkin placed on the surface
 of a pond soon floats away and always remains on the water's surface.
 But a stone does not float away; it stays where it is put and at once sinks
 into the water until it reaches bottom.
 Similarly, when mindfulness is strong, the mind stays with its object and
 penetrates its characteristics deeply.
 It does not wander and merely skim the surface as the mind destitute of
 mindfulness does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness facilitates the achievement of both serenity and insight.
 It can lead to either deep concentration or wisdom, depending on the mode
 in which it is applied.
 Merely a slight shift in the mode of application can spell the difference
 between the course the contemplative process takes, whether it descends
 to deeper levels of inner calm culminating in the stages of absorption,
 the jhanas, or whether instead it strips away the veils of delusion to
 arrive at penetrating insight.
 To lead to the stages of serenity the primary chore of mindfulness is to
 keep the mind on the object, free from straying.
 Mindfulness serves as the guard charged with the responsibility of making
 sure that the mind does not slip away from the object to lose itself in
 random undirected thoughts.
 It also keeps watch over the factors stirring in the mind, catching the
 hindrances beneath their camouflages and expelling them before they can
 cause harm.
 To lead to insight and the realizations of wisdom, mindfulness is exercised
 in a more differentiated manner.
 Its task, in this phase of practice, is to observe, to note, to discern
 phenomena with utmost precision until their fundamental characteristics
 are brought to light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right mindfulness is cultivated through a practice called "the four foundations
 of mindfulness" (cattaro satipatthana), the mindful contemplation of four
 objective spheres: the body, feelings, states of mind, and phenomena.51
 As the Buddha explains:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what, monks, is right mindfulness? Herein, a monk dwells contemplating
 the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having
 put away covetousness and grief concerning the world.
 He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings...
 states of mind in states of mind...
 phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having
 put away covetousness and grief concerning the world.52
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha says that the four foundations of mindfulness form "the only
 way that leads to the attainment of purity, to the overcoming of sorrow
 and lamentation, to the end of pain and grief, to the entering upon the
 right path and the realization of Nibbana."53 They are called "the only
 way" (ekayano maggo), not for the purpose of setting forth a narrow dogmatism,
 but to indicate that the attainment of liberation can only issue from the
 penetrating contemplation of the field of experience undertaken in the
 practice of right mindfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the four applications of mindfulness, the contemplation of the body is
 concerned with the material side of existence; the other three are concerned
 principally (though not solely) with the mental side.
 The completion of the practice requires all four contemplations.
 Though no fixed order is laid down in which they are to be taken up, the
 body is generally taken first as the basic sphere of contemplation; the
 others come into view later, when mindfulness has gained in strength and
 clarity.
 Limitations of space do not allow for a complete explanation of all four
 foundations.
 Here we have to settle for a brief synopsis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Contemplation of the Body (kayanupassana)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha begins his exposition of the body with contemplation of the mindfulne
ss of breathing (anapanasati).
 Though not required as a starting point for meditation, in actual practice
 mindfulness of breathing usually serves as the "root meditation subject"
 (mulakammatthana), the foundation for the entire course of contemplation.
 It would be a mistake, however, to consider this subject merely an exercise
 for neophytes.
 By itself mindfulness of breathing can lead to all the stages of the path
 culminating in full awakening.
 In fact it was this meditation subject that the Buddha used on the night
 of his own enlightenment.
 He also reverted to it throughout the years during his solitary retreats,
 and constantly recommended it to the monks, praising it as "peaceful and
 sublime, an unadulterated blissful abiding, which banishes at once and
 stills evil unwholesome thoughts as soon as they arise" (MN 118).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness of breathing can function so effectively as a subject of meditation
 because it works with a process that is always available to us, the process
 of respiration.
 What it does to turn this process into a basis for meditation is simply
 to bring it into the range of awareness by making the breath an object
 of observation.
 The meditation requires no special intellectual sophistication, only awareness
 of the breath.
 One merely breathes naturally through the nostrils keeping the breath in
 mind at the contact point around the nostrils or upper lip, where the sensation
 of breath can be felt as the air moves in and out.
 There should be no attempt to control the breath or to force it into predetermi
ned rhythms, only a mindful contemplation of the natural process of breathing
 in and out.
 The awareness of breath cuts through the complexities of discursive thinking,
 rescues us from pointless wandering in the labyrinth of vain imaginings,
 and grounds us solidly in the present.
 For whenever we become aware of breathing, really aware of it, we can be
 aware of it only in the present, never in the past or the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha's exposition of mindfulness of breathing involves four basic
 steps.
 The first two (which are not necessarily sequential) require that a long
 inhalation or exhalation be noted as it occurs, and that a short inhalation
 or exhalation be noted as it occurs.
 One simply observes the breath moving in and out, observing it as closely
 as possible, noting whether the breath is long or short.
 As mindfulness grows sharper, the breath can be followed through the entire
 course of its movement, from the beginning of an inhalation through its
 intermediary stages to its end, then from the beginning of an exhalation
 through its intermediary stages to its end.
 This third step is called "clearly perceiving the entire (breath) body."
 The fourth step, "calming the bodily function," involves a progressive
 quieting down of the breath and its associated bodily functions until they
 become extremely fine and subtle.
 Beyond these four basic steps lie more advanced practices which direct
 mindfulness of breathing towards deep concentration and insight.54
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another practice in the contemplation of the body, which extends meditation
 outwards from the confines of a single fixed position, is mindfulness of
 the postures.
 The body can assume four basic postures — walking, standing, sitting, and
 lying down — and a variety of other positions marking the change from one
 posture to another.
 Mindfulness of the postures focuses full attention on the body in whatever
 position it assumes: when walking one is aware of walking, when standing
 one is aware of standing, when sitting one is aware of sitting, when lying
 down one is aware of lying down, when changing postures one is aware of
 changing postures.
 The contemplation of the postures illuminates the impersonal nature of
 the body.
 It reveals that the body is not a self or the belonging of a self, but
 merely a configuration of living matter subject to the directing influence
 of volition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next exercise carries the extension of mindfulness a step further.
 This exercise, called "mindfulness and clear comprehension" (satisampajañña),
 adds to the bare awareness an element of understanding.
 When performing any action, one performs it with full awareness or clear
 comprehension.
 Going and coming, looking ahead and looking aside, bending and stretching,
 dressing, eating, drinking, urinating, defecating, falling asleep, waking
 up, speaking, remaining silent — all become occasions for the progress
 of meditation when done with clear comprehension.
 In the commentaries clear comprehension is explained as fourfold: (1) understan
ding the purpose of the action, i.e., recognizing its aim and determining
 whether that aim accords with the Dhamma; (2) understanding suitability,
 i.e., knowing the most efficient means to achieve one's aim; (3) understanding
 the range of meditation, i.e., keeping the mind constantly in a meditative
 frame even when engaged in action; and (4) understanding without delusion,
 i.e., seeing the action as an impersonal process devoid of a controlling
 ego-entity.55 This last aspect will be explored more thoroughly in the last
 chapter, on the development of wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next two sections on mindfulness of the body present analytical contemplatio
ns intended to expose the body's real nature.
 One of these is the meditation on the body's unattractiveness, already
 touched on in connection with right effort; the other, the analysis of
 the body into the four primary elements.
 The first, the meditation on unattractiveness,56 is designed to counter
 infatuation with the body, especially in its form of sexual desire.
 The Buddha teaches that the sexual drive is a manifestation of craving,
 thus a cause of dukkha that has to be reduced and extricated as a precondition
 for bringing dukkha to an end.
 The meditation aims at weakening sexual desire by depriving the sexual
 urge of its cognitive underpinning, the perception of the body as sensually
 alluring.
 Sensual desire rises and falls together with this perception.
 It springs up because we view the body as attractive; it declines when
 this perception of beauty is removed.
 The perception of bodily attractiveness in turn lasts only so long as the
 body is looked at superficially, grasped in terms of selected impressions.
 To counter that perception we have to refuse to stop with these impressions
 but proceed to inspect the body at a deeper level, with a probing scrutiny
 grounded in dispassion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precisely this is what is undertaken in the meditation on unattractiveness,
 which turns back the tide of sensuality by pulling away its perceptual
 prop.
 The meditation takes one's own body as object, since for a neophyte to
 start off with the body of another, especially a member of the opposite
 sex, might fail to accomplish the desired result.
 Using visualization as an aid, one mentally dissects the body into its
 components and investigates them one by one, bringing their repulsive nature
 to light.
 The texts mention thirty-two parts: head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth,
 skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen,
 lungs, large intestines, small intestines, stomach contents, excrement,
 brain, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, snot, spittle,
 sinovial fluid, and urine.
 The repulsiveness of the parts implies the same for the whole: the body
 seen closeup is truly unattractive, its beautiful appearance a mirage.
 But the aim of this meditation must not be misapprehended.
 The aim is not to produce aversion and disgust but detachment, to extinguish
 the fire of lust by removing its fuel.57
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other analytical contemplation deals with the body in a different way.
 This meditation, called the analysis into elements (dhatuvavatthana), sets
 out to counter our innate tendency to identify with the body by exposing
 the body's essentially impersonal nature.
 The means it employs, as its name indicates, is the mental dissection of
 the body into the four primary elements, referred to by the archaic names
 earth, water, fire, and air, but actually signifying the four principal
 behavioral modes of matter: solidity, fluidity, heat, and oscillation.
 The solid element is seen most clearly in the body's solid parts — the
 organs, tissues, and bones; the fluid element, in the bodily fluids; the
 heat element, in the body's temperature; the oscillation element, in the
 respiratory process.
 The break with the identification of the body as "I" or "my self" is effected
 by a widening of perspective after the elements have come into view.
 Having analyzed the body into the elements, one then considers that all
 four elements, the chief aspects of bodily existence, are essentially identical
 with the chief aspects of external matter, with which the body is in constant
 interchange.
 When one vividly realizes this through prolonged meditation, one ceases
 to identify with the body, ceases to cling to it.
 One sees that the body is nothing more than a particular configuration
 of changing material processes which support a stream of changing mental
 processes.
 There is nothing here that can be considered a truly existent self, nothing
 that can provide a substantial basis for the sense of personal identity.58
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last exercise in mindfulness of the body is a series of "cemetery meditation
s," contemplations of the body's disintegration after death, which may be
 performed either imaginatively, with the aid of pictures, or through direct
 confrontation with a corpse.
 By any of these means one obtains a clear mental image of a decomposing
 body, then applies the process to one's own body, considering: "This body,
 now so full of life, has the same nature and is subject to the same fate.
 It cannot escape death, cannot escape disintegration, but must eventually
 die and decompose." Again, the purpose of this meditation should not be
 misunderstood.
 The aim is not to indulge in a morbid fascination with death and corpses,
 but to sunder our egoistic clinging to existence with a contemplation sufficien
tly powerful to break its hold.
 The clinging to existence subsists through the implicit assumption of permanenc
e.
 In the sight of a corpse we meet the teacher who proclaims unambiguously:
 "Everything formed is impermanent."

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Contemplation of Feeling (vedananupassana)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next foundation of mindfulness is feeling (vedana).
 The word "feeling" is used here, not in the sense of emotion (a complex
 phenomenon best subsumed under the third and fourth foundations of mindfulness)
, but in the narrower sense of the affective tone or "hedonic quality" of
 experience.
 This may be of three kinds, yielding three principal types of feeling:
 pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neutral feeling.
 The Buddha teaches that feeling is an inseparable concomitant of consciousness,
 since every act of knowing is colored by some affective tone.
 Thus feeling is present at every moment of experience; it may be strong
 or weak, clear or indistinct, but some feeling must accompany the cognition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feeling arises in dependence on a mental event called "contact" (phassa).
 Contact marks the "coming together" of consciousness with the object via
 a sense faculty; it is the factor by virtue of which consciousness "touches"
 the object presenting itself to the mind through the sense organ.
 Thus there are six kinds of contact distinguished by the six sense faculties
 — eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact,
 and mind-contact — and six kinds of feeling distinguished by the contact
 from which they spring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feeling acquires special importance as an object of contemplation because
 it is feeling that usually triggers the latent defilements into activity.
 The feelings may not be clearly registered, but in subtle ways they nourish
 and sustain the dispositions to unwholesome states.
 Thus when a pleasant feeling arises, we fall under the influence of the
 defilement greed and cling to it.
 When a painful feeling occurs, we respond with displeasure, hate, and fear,
 which are aspects of aversion.
 And when a neutral feeling occurs, we generally do not notice it, or let
 it lull us into a false sense of security — states of mind governed by
 delusion.
 From this it can be seen that each of the root defilements is conditioned
 by a particular kind of feeling: greed by pleasant feeling, aversion by
 painful feeling, delusion by neutral feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the link between feelings and the defilements is not a necessary one.
 Pleasure does not always have to lead to greed, pain to aversion, neutral
 feeling to delusion.
 The tie between them can be snapped, and one essential means for snapping
 it is mindfulness.
 Feeling will stir up a defilement only when it is not noticed, when it
 is indulged rather than observed.
 By turning it into an object of observation, mindfulness defuses the feeling
 so that it cannot provoke an unwholesome response.
 Then, instead of relating to the feeling by way of habit through attachment,
 repulsion, or apathy, we relate by way of contemplation, using the feeling
 as a springboard for understanding the nature of experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early stages the contemplation of feeling involves attending to the
 arisen feelings, noting their distinctive qualities: pleasant, painful,
 neutral.
 The feeling is noted without identifying with it, without taking it to
 be "I" or "mine" or something happening "to me." Awareness is kept at the
 level of bare attention: one watches each feeling that arises, seeing it
 as merely a feeling, a bare mental event shorn of all subjective references,
 all pointers to an ego.
 The task is simply to note the feeling's quality, its tone of pleasure,
 pain, or neutrality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as practice advances, as one goes on noting each feeling, letting it
 go and noting the next, the focus of attention shifts from the qualities
 of feelings to the process of feeling itself.
 The process reveals a ceaseless flux of feelings arising and dissolving,
 succeeding one another without a halt.
 Within the process there is nothing lasting.
 Feeling itself is only a stream of events, occasions of feeling flashing
 into being moment by moment, dissolving as soon as they arise.
 Thus begins the insight into impermanence, which, as it evolves, overturns
 the three unwholesome roots.
 There is no greed for pleasant feelings, no aversion for painful feelings,
 no delusion over neutral feelings.
 All are seen as merely fleeting and substanceless events devoid of any
 true enjoyment or basis for involvement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Contemplation of the State of Mind (cittanupassana)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this foundation of mindfulness we turn from a particular mental factor,
 feeling, to the general state of mind to which that factor belongs.
 To understand what is entailed by this contemplation it is helpful to look
 at the Buddhist conception of the mind.
 Usually we think of the mind as an enduring faculty remaining identical
 with itself through the succession of experiences.
 Though experience changes, the mind which undergoes the changing experience
 seems to remain the same, perhaps modified in certain ways but still retaining
 its identity.
 However, in the Buddha's teaching the notion of a permanent mental organ
 is rejected.
 The mind is regarded, not as a lasting subject of thought, feeling, and
 volition, but as a sequence of momentary mental acts, each distinct and
 discrete, their connections with one another causal rather than substantial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single act of consciousness is called a citta, which we shall render "a
 state of mind." Each citta consists of many components, the chief of which
 is consciousness itself, the basic experiencing of the object; consciousness
 is also called citta, the name for the whole being given to its principal
 part.
 Along with consciousness every citta contains a set of concomitants called
 cetasikas, mental factors.
 These include feeling, perception, volition, the emotions, etc.; in short,
 all the mental functions except the primary knowing of the object, which
 is citta or consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since consciousness in itself is just a bare experiencing of an object,
 it cannot be differentiated through its own nature but only by way of its
 associated factors, the cetasikas.
 The cetasikas color the citta and give it its distinctive character; thus
 when we want to pinpoint the citta as an object of contemplation, we have
 to do so by using the cetasikas as indicators.
 In his exposition of the contemplation of the state of mind, the Buddha
 mentions, by reference to cetasikas, sixteen kinds of citta to be noted:
 the mind with lust, the mind without lust, the mind with aversion, the
 mind without aversion, the mind with delusion, the mind without delusion,
 the cramped mind, the scattered mind, the developed mind, the undeveloped
 mind, the surpassable mind, the unsurpassable mind, the concentrated mind,
 the unconcentrated mind, the freed mind, the unfreed mind.
 For practical purposes it is sufficient at the start to focus solely on
 the first six states, noting whether the mind is associated with any of
 the unwholesome roots or free from them.
 When a particular citta is present, it is contemplated merely as a citta,
 a state of mind.
 It is not identified with as "I" or "mine," not taken as a self or as something
 belonging to a self.
 Whether it is a pure state of mind or a defiled state, a lofty state or
 a low one, there should be no elation or dejection, only a clear recognition
 of the state.
 The state is simply noted, then allowed to pass without clinging to the
 desired ones or resenting the undesired ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As contemplation deepens, the contents of the mind become increasingly rarefied.
 Irrelevant flights of thought, imagination, and emotion subside, mindfulness
 becomes clearer, the mind remains intently aware, watching its own process
 of becoming.
 At times there might appear to be a persisting observer behind the process,
 but with continued practice even this apparent observer disappears.
 The mind itself — the seemingly solid, stable mind — dissolves into a stream
 of cittas flashing in and out of being moment by moment, coming from nowhere
 and going nowhere, yet continuing in sequence without pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Contemplation of Phenomena (dhammanupassana)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of the fourth foundation of mindfulness, the multivalent
 word dhamma (here intended in the plural) has two interconnected meanings,
 as the account in the sutta shows.
 One meaning is cetasikas, the mental factors, which are now attended to
 in their own right apart from their role as coloring the state of mind,
 as was done in the previous contemplation.
 The other meaning is the elements of actuality, the ultimate constituents
 of experience as structured in the Buddha's teaching.To convey both senses
 we render dhamma as "phenomena," for lack of a better alternative.
 But when we do so this should not be taken to imply the existence of some
 noumenon or substance behind the phenomena.The point of the Buddha's teaching
 of anatta, egolessness, is that the basic constituents of actuality are
 bare phenomena (suddha-dhamma) occurring without any noumenal support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sutta section on the contemplation of phenomena is divided into five
 sub-sections, each devoted to a different set of phenomena: the five hindrances
, the five aggregates, the six inner and outer sense bases, the seven factors
 of enlightenment, and the Four Noble Truths.
 Among these, the five hindrances and the seven enlightenment factors are
 dhamma in the narrower sense of mental factors, the others are dhamma in
 the broader sense of constituents of actuality.
 (In the third section, however, on the sense bases, there is a reference
 to the fetters that arise through the senses; these can also be included
 among the mental factors.) In the present chapter we shall deal briefly
 only with the two groups that may be regarded as dhamma in the sense of
 mental factors.
 We already touched on both of these in relation to right effort (Chapter
 V); now we shall consider them in specific connection with the practice
 of right mindfulness.
 We shall discuss the other types of dhamma — the five aggregates and the
 six senses — in the final chapter, in relation to the development of wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment require special attention
 because they are the principal impediments and aids to liberation.
 The hindrances — sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessnes
s and worry, and doubt — generally become manifest in an early stage of
 practice, soon after the initial expectations and gross disturbances subside
 and the subtle tendencies find the opportunity to surface.
 Whenever one of the hindrances crops up, its presence should be noted;
 then, when it fades away, a note should be made of its disappearance.
 To ensure that the hindrances are kept under control an element of comprehensio
n is needed: we have to understand how the hindrances arise, how they can
 be removed, and how they can be prevented from arising in the future.59
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar mode of contemplation is to be applied to the seven factors of
 enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquillity,
 concentration, and equanimity.
 When any one of these factors arises, its presence should be noted.
 Then, after noting its presence, one has to investigate to discover how
 it arises and how it can be matured.60 When they first spring up, the enlightenm
ent factors are weak, but with consistent cultivation they accumulate strength.
 Mindfulness initiates the contemplative process.
 When it becomes well-established, it arouses investigation, the probing
 quality of intelligence.
 Investigation in turn calls forth energy, energy gives rise to rapture,
 rapture leads to tranquillity, tranquillity to one-pointed concentration,
 and concentration to equanimity.
 Thus the whole evolving course of practice leading to enlightenment begins
 with mindfulness, which remains throughout as the regulating power ensuring
 that the mind is clear, cognizant, and balanced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter VII: Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eighth factor of the path is right concentration, in Pali samma samadhi.
 Concentration represents an intensification of a mental factor present
 in every state of consciousness.
 This factor, one-pointedness of mind (citt'ekaggata), has the function
 of unifying the other mental factors in the task of cognition.
 It is the factor responsible for the individuating aspect of consciousness,
 ensuring that every citta or act of mind remains centered on its object.
 At any given moment the mind must be cognizant of something — a sight,
 a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch, or a mental object.
 The factor of one-pointedness unifies the mind and its other concomitants
 in the task of cognizing the object, while it simultaneously exercises
 the function of centering all the constituents of the cognitive act on
 the object.
 One-pointedness of mind explains the fact that in any act of consciousness
 there is a central point of focus, towards which the entire objective datum
 points from its outer peripheries to its inner nucleus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, samadhi is only a particular kind of one-pointedness; it is not
 equivalent to one-pointedness in its entirety.
 A gourmet sitting down to a meal, an assassin about to slay his victim,
 a soldier on the battlefield — these all act with a concentrated mind,
 but their concentration cannot be characterized as samadhi.Samadhi is exclusivel
y wholesome one-pointedness, the concentration in a wholesome state of mind.
 Even then its range is still narrower: it does not signify every form of
 wholesome concentration, but only the intensified concentration that results
 from a deliberate attempt to raise the mind to a higher, more purified
 level of awareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commentaries define samadhi as the centering of the mind and mental
 factors rightly and evenly on an object.
 Samadhi, as wholesome concentration, collects together the ordinarily dispersed
 and dissipated stream of mental states to induce an inner unification.
 The two salient features of a concentrated mind are unbroken attentiveness
 to an object and the consequent tranquillity of the mental functions, qualities
 which distinguish it from the unconcentrated mind.
 The mind untrained in concentration moves in a scattered manner which the
 Buddha compares to the flapping about of a fish taken from the water and
 thrown onto dry land.
 It cannot stay fixed but rushes from idea to idea, from thought to thought,
 without inner control.
 Such a distracted mind is also a deluded mind.
 Overwhelmed by worries and concerns, a constant prey to the defilements,
 it sees things only in fragments, distorted by the ripples of random thoughts.
 But the mind that has been trained in concentration, in contrast, can remain
 focused on its object without distraction.
 This freedom from distraction further induces a softness and serenity which
 make the mind an effective instrument for penetration.
 Like a lake unruffled by any breeze, the concentrated mind is a faithful
 reflector that mirrors whatever is placed before it exactly as it is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Development of Concentration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concentration can be developed through either of two methods — either as
 the goal of a system of practice directed expressly towards the attainment
 of deep concentration at the level of absorption or as the incidental accompani
ment of the path intended to generate insight.
 The former method is called the development of serenity (samatha-bhavana),
 the second the development of insight (vipassana-bhavana).
 Both paths share certain preliminary requirements.
 For both, moral discipline must be purified, the various impediments must
 be severed, the meditator must seek out suitable instruction (preferrably
 from a personal teacher), and must resort to a dwelling conducive to practice.
 Once these preliminaries have been dispensed with, the meditator on the
 path of serenity has to obtain an object of meditation, something to be
 used as a focal point for developing concentration.61
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the meditator has a qualified teacher, the teacher will probably assign
 him an object judged to be appropriate for his temperament.
 If he doesn't have a teacher, he will have to select an object himself,
 perhaps after some experimentation.
 The meditation manuals collect the subjects of serenity meditation into
 a set of forty, called "places of work" (kammatthana) since they are the
 places where the meditator does the work of practice.
 The forty may be listed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ten kasinas ten unattractive objects (dasa asubha) ten recollections (dasa
 anussatiyo) four sublime states (cattaro brahmavihara) four immaterial
 states (cattaro aruppa) one perception (eka sañña) one analysis (eka vavatthana
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kasinas are devices representing certain primordial qualities.
 Four represent the primary elements — the earth, water, fire, and air kasinas;
 four represent colors — the blue, yellow, red, and white kasinas; the other
 two are the light and the space kasinas.
 Each kasina is a concrete object representative of the universal quality
 it signifies.
 Thus an earth kasina would be a circular disk filled with clay.
 To develop concentration on the earth kasina the meditator sets the disk
 in front of him, fixes his gaze on it, and contemplates "earth, earth."
 A similar method is used for the other kasinas, with appropriate changes
 to fit the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ten "unattractive objects" are corpses in different stages of decomposition.
 This subject appears similar to the contemplation of bodily decay in the
 mindfulness of the body, and in fact in olden times the cremation ground
 was recommended as the most appropriate place for both.
 But the two meditations differ in emphasis.
 In the mindfulness exercise stress falls on the application of reflective
 thought, the sight of the decaying corpse serving as a stimulus for considerati
on of one's own eventual death and disintegration.
 In this exercise the use of reflective thought is discouraged.
 The stress instead falls on one-pointed mental fixation on the object,
 the less thought the better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ten recollections form a miscellaneous collection.
 The first three are devotional meditations on the qualities of the Triple
 Gem — the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; they use as their basis standard
 formulas that have come down in the Suttas.
 The next three recollections also rely on ancient formulas: the meditations
 on morality, generosity, and the potential for divine-like qualities in
 oneself.
 Then come mindfulness of death, the contemplation of the unattractive nature
 of the body, mindfulness of breathing, and lastly, the recollection of
 peace, a discursive meditation on Nibbana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four sublime states or "divine abodes" are the outwardly directed social
 attitudes — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity
 — developed into universal radiations which are gradually extended in range
 until they encompass all living beings.
 The four immaterial states are the objective bases for certain deep levels
 of absorption: the base of infinite space, the base of infinite consciousness,
 the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.
 These become accessible as objects only to those who are already adept
 in concentration.
 The "one perception" is the perception of the repulsiveness of food, a
 discursive topic intended to reduce attachment to the pleasures of the
 palate.
 The "one analysis" is the contemplation of the body in terms of the four
 primary elements, already discussed in the chapter on right mindfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When such a variety of meditation subjects is presented, the aspiring meditator
 without a teacher might be perplexed as to which to choose.
 The manuals divide the forty subjects according to their suitability for
 different personality types.
 Thus the unattractive objects and the contemplation of the parts of the
 body are judged to be most suitable for a lustful type, the meditation
 on loving-kindness to be best for a hating type, the meditation on the
 qualities of the Triple Gem to be most effective for a devotional type,
 etc.
 But for practical purposes the beginner in meditation can generally be
 advised to start with a simple subject that helps reduce discursive thinking.
 Mental distraction caused by restlessness and scattered thoughts is a common
 problem faced by persons of all different character types; thus a meditator
 of any temperament can benefit from a subject which promotes a slowing
 down and stilling of the thought process.
 The subject generally recommended for its effectiveness in clearing the
 mind of stray thoughts is mindfulness of breathing, which can therefore
 be suggested as the subject most suitable for beginners as well as veterans
 seeking a direct approach to deep concentration.
 Once the mind settles down and one's thought patterns become easier to
 notice, one might then make use of other subjects to deal with special
 problems that arise: the meditation on loving-kindness may be used to counterac
t anger and ill will, mindfulness of the bodily parts to weaken sensual
 lust, the recollection of the Buddha to inspire faith and devotion, the
 meditation on death to arouse a sense of urgency.
 The ability to select the subject appropriate to the situation requires
 skill, but this skill evolves through practice, often through simple trial-and-
error experimentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Stages of Concentration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concentration is not attained all at once but develops in stages.
 To enable our exposition to cover all the stages of concentration, we will
 consider the case of a meditator who follows the entire path of serenity
 meditation from start to finish, and who will make much faster progress
 than the typical meditator is likely to make.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After receiving his meditation subject from a teacher, or selecting it on
 his own, the meditator retires to a quiet place.
 There he assumes the correct meditation posture — the legs crossed comfortably,
 the upper part of the body held straight and erect, hands placed one above
 the other on the lap, the head kept steady, the mouth and eyes closed (unless
 a kasina or other visual object is used), the breath flowing naturally
 and regularly through the nostrils.
 He then focuses his mind on the object and tries to keep it there, fixed
 and alert.
 If the mind strays, he notices this quickly, catches it, and brings it
 back gently but firmly to the object, doing this over and over as often
 as is necessary.
 This initial stage is called preliminary concentration (parikkamma-samadhi)
 and the object the preliminary sign (parikkamma-nimitta).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the initial excitement subsides and the mind begins to settle into
 the practice, the five hindrances are likely to arise, bubbling up from
 the depths.
 Sometimes they appear as thoughts, sometimes as images, sometimes as obsessive
 emotions: surges of desire, anger and resentment, heaviness of mind, agitation,
 doubts.
 The hindrances pose a formidable barrier, but with patience and sustained
 effort they can be overcome.
 To conquer them the meditator will have to be adroit.
 At times, when a particular hindrance becomes strong, he may have to lay
 aside his primary subject of meditation and take up another subject expressly
 opposed to the hindrance.
 At other times he will have to persist with his primary subject despite
 the bumps along the road, bringing his mind back to it again and again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he goes on striving along the path of concentration, his exertion activates
 five mental factors which come to his aid.
 These factors are intermittently present in ordinary undirected consciousness,
 but there they lack a unifying bond and thus do not play any special role.
 However, when activated by the work of meditation, these five factors pick
 up power, link up with one another, and steer the mind towards samadhi,
 which they will govern as the "jhana factors," the factors of absorption
 (jhananga).
 Stated in their usual order the five are: initial application of mind (vitakka)
, sustained application of mind (vicara), rapture (piti), happiness (sukha),
 and one-pointedness (ekaggata).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial application of mind does the work of directing the mind to the object.
 It takes the mind, lifts it up, and drives it into the object the way one
 drives a nail through a block of wood.
 This done, sustained application of mind anchors the mind on the object,
 keeping it there through its function of examination.
 To clarify the difference between these two factors, initial application
 is compared to the striking of a bell, sustained application to the bell's
 reverberations.
 Rapture, the third factor, is the delight and joy that accompany a favorable
 interest in the object, while happiness, the fourth factor, is the pleasant
 feeling that accompanies successful concentration.
 Since rapture and happiness share similar qualities they tend to be confused
 with each other, but the two are not identical.
 The difference between them is illustrated by comparing rapture to the
 joy of a weary desert-farer who sees an oasis in the distance, happiness
 to his pleasure when drinking from the pond and resting in the shade.
 The fifth and final factor of absorption is one-pointedness, which has
 the pivotal function of unifying the mind on the object.62
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When concentration is developed, these five factors spring up and counteract
 the five hindrances.
 Each absorption factor opposes a particular hindrance.
 Initial application of mind, through its work of lifting the mind up to
 the object, counters dullness and drowsiness.
 Sustained application, by anchoring the mind on the object, drives away
 doubt.
 Rapture shuts out ill will, happiness excludes restlessness and worry,
 and one-pointedness counters sensual desire, the most alluring inducement
 to distraction.
 Thus, with the strengthening of the absorption factors, the hindrances
 fade out and subside.
 They are not yet eradicated — eradication can only be effected by wisdom,
 the third division of the path — but they have been reduced to a state
 of quiescence where they cannot disrupt the forward movement of concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time that the hindrances are being overpowered by the jhana
 factors inwardly, on the side of the object too certain changes are taking
 place.
 The original object of concentration, the preliminary sign, is a gross
 physical object; in the case of a kasina, it is a disk representing the
 chosen element or color, in the case of mindfulness of breathing the touch
 sensation of the breath, etc.
 But with the strengthening of concentration the original object gives rise
 to another object called the "learning sign" (uggaha-nimitta).
 For a kasina this will be a mental image of the disk seen as clearly in
 the mind as the original object was with the eyes; for the breath it will
 be a reflex image arisen from the touch sensation of the air currents moving
 around the nostrils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the learning sign appears, the meditator leaves off the preliminary
 sign and fixes his attention on the new object.
 In due time still another object will emerge out of the learning sign.
 This object, called the "counterpart sign" (patibhaga-nimitta), is a purified
 mental image many times brighter and clearer than the learning sign.
 The learning sign is compared to the moon seen behind a cloud, the counterpart
 sign to the moon freed from the cloud.
 Simultaneously with the appearance of the counterpart sign, the five absorption
 factors suppress the five hindrances, and the mind enters the stage of
 concentration called upacara-samadhi, "access concentration." Here, in access
 concentration, the mind is drawing close to absorption.
 It has entered the "neighbourhood" (a possible meaning of upacara) of absorptio
n, but more work is still needed for it to become fully immersed in the
 object, the defining mark of absorption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With further practice the factors of concentration gain in strength and
 bring the mind to absorption (appana-samadhi).
 Like access concentration, absorption takes the counterpart sign as object.
 The two stages of concentration are differentiated neither by the absence
 of the hindrances nor by the counterpart sign as object; these are common
 to both.
 What differentiates them is the strength of the jhana factors.
 In access concentration the jhana factors are present, but they lack strength
 and steadiness.
 Thus the mind in this stage is compared to a child who has just learned
 to walk: he takes a few steps, falls down, gets up, walks some more, and
 again falls down.
 But the mind in absorption is like a man who wants to walk: he just gets
 up and walks straight ahead without hesitation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concentration in the stage of absorption is divided into eight levels, each
 marked by greater depth, purity, and subtlety than its predecessor.
 The first four form a set called the four jhanas, a word best left untranslated
 for lack of a suitable equivalent, though it can be loosely rendered "meditativ
e absorption."63 The second four also form a set, the four immaterial states
 (aruppa).
 The eight have to be attained in progressive order, the achievement of
 any later level being dependent on the mastery of the immediately preceding
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four jhanas make up the usual textual definition of right concentration.
 Thus the Buddha says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what, monks, is right concentration? Herein, secluded from sense pleasures,
 secluded from unwholesome states, a monk enters and dwells in the first
 jhana, which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind
 and filled with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, with the subsiding of initial and sustained application of mind, by
 gaining inner confidence and mental unification, he enters and dwells in
 the second jhana, which is free from initial and sustained application
 but is filled with rapture and happiness born of concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the fading out of rapture, he dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly
 comprehending; and he experiences in his own person that bliss of which
 the noble ones say: "Happily lives he who is equanimous and mindful" —
 thus he enters and dwells in the third jhana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance
 of joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana, which has neither-p
leasure-nor-pain and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, monks, is right concentration.64
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The jhanas are distinguished by way of their component factors.
 The first jhana is constituted by the original set of five absorption factors:
 initial application, sustained application, rapture, happiness, and one-pointed
ness.
 After attaining the first jhana the meditator is advised to master it.
 On the one hand he should not fall into complacency over his achievement
 and neglect sustained practice; on the other, he should not become over-confide
nt and rush ahead to attain the next jhana.
 To master the jhana he should enter it repeatedly and perfect his skill
 in it, until he can attain it, remain in it, emerge from it, and review
 it without any trouble or difficulty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After mastering the first jhana, the meditator then considers that his attainmen
t has certain defects.
 Though the jhana is certainly far superior to ordinary sense consciousness,
 more peaceful and blissful, it still stands close to sense consciousness
 and is not far removed from the hindrances.
 Moreover, two of its factors, initial application and sustained application,
 appear in time to be rather coarse, not as refined as the other factors.
 Then the meditator renews his practice of concentration intent on overcoming
 initial and sustained application.
 When his faculties mature, these two factors subside and he enters the
 second jhana.
 This jhana contains only three component factors: rapture, happiness, and
 one-pointedness.
 It also contains a multiplicity of other constituents, the most prominent
 of which is confidence of mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second jhana the mind becomes more tranquil and more thoroughly unified,
 but when mastered even this state seems gross, as it includes rapture,
 an exhilarating factor that inclines to excitation.
 So the meditator sets out again on his course of training, this time resolved
 on overcoming rapture.
 When rapture fades out, he enters the third jhana.
 Here there are only two absorption factors, happiness and one-pointedness,
 while some other auxiliary states come into ascendency, most notably mindfulnes
s, clear comprehension, and equanimity.
 But still, the meditator sees, this attainment is defective in that it
 contains the feeling of happiness, which is gross compared to neutral feeling,
 feeling that is neither pleasant not painful.
 Thus he strives to get beyond even the sublime happiness of the third jhana.
 When he succeeds, he enters the fourth jhana, which is defined by two factors
 — one-pointedness and neutral feeling — and has a special purity of mindfulness
 due to the high level of equanimity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond the four jhanas lie the four immaterial states, levels of absorption
 in which the mind transcends even the subtlest perception of visualized
 images still sometimes persisting in the jhanas.
 The immaterial states are attained, not by refining mental factors as are
 the jhanas, but by refining objects, by replacing a relatively gross object
 with a subtler one.
 The four attainments are named after their respective objects: the base
 of infinite space, the base of infinite consciousness, the base of nothingness,
 and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.65 These states represent
 levels of concentration so subtle and remote as to elude clear verbal explanati
on.
 The last of the four stands at the apex of mental concentration; it is
 the absolute, maximum degree of unification possible for consciousness.
 But even so, these absorptions reached by the path of serenity meditation,
 as exalted as they are, still lack the wisdom of insight, and so are not
 yet sufficient for gaining deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kinds of concentration discussed so far arise by fixing the mind upon
 a single object to the exclusion of other objects.
 But apart from these there is another kind of concentration which does
 not depend upon restricting the range of awareness.
 This is called "momentary concentration" (khanika-samadhi).
 To develop momentary concentration the meditator does not deliberately
 attempt to exclude the multiplicity of phenomena from his field of attention.
 Instead, he simply directs mindfulness to the changing states of mind and
 body, noting any phenomenon that presents itself; the task is to maintain
 a continuous awareness of whatever enters the range of perception, clinging
 to nothing.
 As he goes on with his noting, concentration becomes stronger moment after
 moment until it becomes established one-pointedly on the constantly changing
 stream of events.
 Despite the change in the object, the mental unification remains steady,
 and in time acquires a force capable of suppressing the hindrances to a
 degree equal to that of access concentration.
 This fluid, mobile concentration is developed by the practice of the four
 foundations of mindfulness, taken up along the path of insight; when sufficient
ly strong it issues in the breakthrough to the last stage of the path, the
 arising of wisdom.

Chapter VIII: The Development of Wisdom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though right concentration claims the last place among the factors of the
 Noble Eightfold Path, concentration itself does not mark the path's culmination.
 The attainment of concentration makes the mind still and steady, unifies
 its concomitants, opens vast vistas of bliss, serenity, and power.
 But by itself it does not suffice to reach the highest accomplishment,
 release from the bonds of suffering.
 To reach the end of suffering demands that the Eightfold Path be turned
 into an instrument of discovery, that it be used to generate the insights
 unveiling the ultimate truth of things.
 This requires the combined contributions of all eight factors, and thus
 a new mobilization of right view and right intention.
 Up to the present point these first two path factors have performed only
 a preliminary function.
 Now they have to be taken up again and raised to a higher level.
 Right view is to become a direct seeing into the real nature of phenomena,
 previously grasped only conceptually; right intention, to become a true
 renunciation of defilements born out of deep understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we turn to the development of wisdom, it will be helpful to inquire
 why concentration is not adequate to the attainment of liberation.
 Concentration does not suffice to bring liberation because it fails to
 touch the defilements at their fundamental level.
 The Buddha teaches that the defilements are stratified into three layers:
 the stage of latent tendency, the stage of manifestation, and the stage
 of transgression.
 The most deeply grounded is the level of latent tendency (anusaya), where
 a defilement merely lies dormant without displaying any activity.
 The second level is the stage of manifestation (pariyutthana), where a
 defilement, through the impact of some stimulus, surges up in the form
 of unwholesome thoughts, emotions, and volitions.
 Then, at the third level, the defilement passes beyond a purely mental
 manifestation to motivate some unwholesome action of body or speech.
 Hence this level is called the stage of transgression (vitikkama).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path provide the check against
 this threefold layering of the defilements.
 The first, the training in moral discipline, restrains unwholesome bodily
 and verbal activity and thus prevents defilements from reaching the stage
 of transgression.
 The training in concentration provides the safeguard against the stage
 of manifestation.
 It removes already manifest defilements and protects the mind from their
 continued influx.
 But even though concentration may be pursued to the depths of full absorption,
 it cannot touch the basic source of affliction — the latent tendencies
 lying dormant in the mental continuum.
 Against these concentration is powerless, since to root them out calls
 for more than mental calm.
 What it calls for, beyond the composure and serenity of the unified mind,
 is wisdom (pañña), a penetrating vision of phenomena in their fundamental
 mode of being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wisdom alone can cut off the latent tendencies at their root because the
 most fundamental member of the set, the one which nurtures the others and
 holds them in place, is ignorance (avijja), and wisdom is the remedy for
 ignorance.
 Though verbally a negative, "unknowing," ignorance is not a factual negative,
 a mere privation of right knowledge.
 It is, rather, an insidious and volatile mental factor incessantly at work
 inserting itself into every compartment of our inner life.
 It distorts cognition, dominates volition, and determines the entire tone
 of our existence.
 As the Buddha says: "The element of ignorance is indeed a powerful element"
 (SN 14:13).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the cognitive level, which is its most basic sphere of operation, ignorance
 infiltrates our perceptions, thoughts, and views, so that we come to misconstru
e our experience, overlaying it with multiple strata of delusions.
 The most important of these delusions are three: the delusions of seeing
 permanence in the impermanent, of seing satisfaction in the unsatisfactory,
 and of seeing a self in the selfless.66 Thus we take ourselves and our world
 to be solid, stable, enduring entities, despite the ubiquitous reminders
 that everything is subject to change and destruction.
 We assume we have an innate right to pleasure, and direct our efforts to
 increasing and intensifying our enjoyment with an anticipatory fervor undaunted
 by repeated encounters with pain, disappointment, and frustration.
 And we perceive ourselves as self-contained egos, clinging to the various
 ideas and images we form of ourselves as the irrefragable truth of our
 identity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereas ignorance obscures the true nature of things, wisdom removes the
 veils of distortion, enabling us to see phenomena in their fundamental
 mode of being with the vivacity of direct perception.
 The training in wisdom centers on the development of insight (vipassana-bhavana
), a deep and comprehensive seeing into the nature of existence which fathoms
 the truth of our being in the only sphere where it is directly accessible
 to us, namely, in our own experience.
 Normally we are immersed in our experience, identified with it so completely
 that we do not comprehend it.
 We live it but fail to understand its nature.
 Due to this blindness experience comes to be misconstrued, worked upon
 by the delusions of permanence, pleasure, and self.
 Of these cognitive distortions, the most deeply grounded and resistant
 is the delusion of self, the idea that at the core of our being there exists
 a truly established "I" with which we are essentially identified.
 This notion of self, the Buddha teaches, is an error, a mere presupposition
 lacking a real referent.
 Yet, though a mere presupposition, the idea of self is not inconsequential.
 To the contrary, it entails consequences that can be calamitous.
 Because we make the view of self the lookout point from which we survey
 the world, our minds divide everything up into the dualities of "I" and
 "not I," what is "mine" and what is "not mine." Then, trapped in these dichotomi
es, we fall victim to the defilements they breed, the urges to grasp and
 destroy, and finally to the suffering that inevitably follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To free ourselves from all defilements and suffering, the illusion of selfhood
 that sustains them has to be dispelled, exploded by the realization of
 selflessness.
 Precisely this is the task set for the development of wisdom.
 The first step along the path of development is an analytical one.
 In order to uproot the view of self, the field of experience has to be
 laid out in certain sets of factors, which are then methodically investigated
 to ascertain that none of them singly or in combination can be taken as
 a self.
 This analytical treatment of experience, so characteristic of the higher
 reaches of Buddhist philosophical psychology, is not intended to suggest
 that experience, like a watch or car, can be reduced to an accidental conglomer
ation of separable parts.
 Experience does have an irreducible unity, but this unity is functional
 rather than substantial; it does not require the postulate of a unifying
 self separate from the factors, retaining its identity as a constant amidst
 the ceaseless flux.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of analysis applied most often is that of the five aggregates
 of clinging (panc'upadanakkhandha): material form, feeling, perception,
 mental formations, and consciousness.67 Material form constitutes the material
 side of existence: the bodily organism with its sense faculties and the
 outer objects of cognition.
 The other four aggregates constitute the mental side.
 Feeling provides the affective tone, perception the factor of noting and
 identifying, the mental formations the volitional and emotive elements,
 and consciousness the basic awareness essential to the whole occasion of
 experience.
 The analysis by way of the five aggregates paves the way for an attempt
 to see experience solely in terms of its constituting factors, without
 slipping in implicit references to an unfindable self.
 To gain this perspective requires the development of intensive mindfulness,
 now applied to the fourth foundation, the contemplation of the factors
 of existence (dhammanupassana).
 The disciple will dwell contemplating the five aggregates, their arising
 and passing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena, namely, of the five aggregate
s of clinging.
 He knows what material form is, how it arises, how it passes away; knows
 what feeling is, how it arises, how it passes away; knows what perception
 is, how it arises, how it passes away; knows what mental formations are,
 how they arise, how they pass away; knows what consciousness is, how it
 arises, how it passes away.68
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or the disciple may instead base his contemplation on the six internal and
 external spheres of sense experience, that is, the six sense faculties
 and their corresponding objects, also taking note of the "fetters" or defilemen
ts that arise from such sensory contacts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena, namely, of the six internal
 and external sense bases.
 He knows the eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odors, the
 tongue and tastes, the body and tangibles, the mind and mental objects;
 and he knows as well the fetter that arises in dependence on them.
 He understands how the unarisen fetter arises, how the arisen fetter is
 abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter does not arise again in the future.69
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The view of self is further attenuated by examining the factors of existence,
 not analytically, but in terms of their relational structure.
 Inspection reveals that the aggregates exist solely in dependence on conditions.
 Nothing in the set enjoys the absolute self-sufficiency of being attributed
 to the assumed "I." Whatever factors in the body-mind complex be looked
 at, they are found to be dependently arisen, tied to the vast net of events
 extending beyond themselves temporally and spatially.
 The body, for example, has arisen through the union of sperm and egg and
 subsists in dependence on food, water, and air.
 Feeling, perception, and mental formations occur in dependence on the body
 with its sense faculties.
 They require an object, the corresponding consciousness, and the contact
 of the object with the consciousness through the media of the sense faculties.
 Consciousness in its turn depends on the sentient organism and the entire
 assemblage of co-arisen mental factors.
 This whole process of becoming, moreover, has arisen from the previous
 lives in this particular chain of existences and inherit all the accumulated
 kamma of the earlier existences.
 Thus nothing possesses a self-sufficient mode of being.
 All conditioned phenomena exist relationally, contingent and dependent
 on other things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above two steps — the factorial analysis and the discernment of relations
 — help cut away the intellectual adherence to the idea of self, but they
 lack sufficient power to destroy the ingrained clinging to the ego sustained
 by erroneous perception.
 To uproot this subtle form of ego-clinging requires a counteractive perception:
 direct insight into the empty, coreless nature of phenomena.
 Such an insight is generated by contemplating the factors of existence
 in terms of their three universal marks — impermanence (aniccata), unsatisfacto
riness (dukkhata), and selflessness (anattata).
 Generally, the first of the three marks to be discerned is impermanence,
 which at the level of insight does not mean merely that everything eventually
 comes to an end.
 At this level it means something deeper and more pervasive, namely, that
 conditioned phenomena are in constant process, happenings which break up
 and perish almost as soon as they arise.
 The stable objects appearing to the senses reveal themselves to be strings
 of momentary formations (sankhara); the person posited by common sense
 dissolves into a current made up of two intertwining streams — a stream
 of material events, the aggregate of material form, and a stream of mental
 events, the other four aggregates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When impermanence is seen, insight into the other two marks closely follows.
 Since the aggregates are constantly breaking up, we cannot pin our hopes
 on them for any lasting satisfaction.
 Whatever expectations we lay on them are bound to be dashed to pieces by
 their inevitable change.
 Thus when seen with insight they are dukkha, suffering, in the deepest
 sense.
 Then, as the aggregates are impermanent and unsatisfactory, they cannot
 be taken as self.
 If they were self, or the belongings of a self, we would be able to control
 them and bend them to our will, to make them everlasting sources of bliss.
 But far from being able to exercise such mastery, we find them to be grounds
 of pain and disappointment.
 Since they cannot be subjected to control, these very factors of our being
 are anatta: not a self, not the belongings of a self, just empty, ownerless
 phenomena occurring in dependence on conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the course of insight practice is entered, the eight path factors become
 charged with an intensity previously unknown.
 They gain in force and fuse together into the unity of a single cohesive
 path heading towards the goal.
 In the practice of insight all eight factors and three trainings co-exist;
 each is there supporting all the others; each makes its own unique contribution
 to the work.
 The factors of moral discipline hold the tendencies to transgression in
 check with such care that even the thought of unethical conduct does not
 arise.
 The factors of the concentration group keep the mind firmly fixed upon
 the stream of phenomena, contemplating whatever arises with impeccable
 precision, free from forgetfulness and distraction.
 Right view, as the wisdom of insight, grows continually sharper and deeper;
 right intention shows itself in a detachment and steadiness of purpose
 bringing an unruffled poise to the entire process of contemplation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insight meditation takes as its objective sphere the "conditioned formations"
 (sankhara) comprised in the five aggregates.
 Its task is to uncover their essential characteristics: the three marks
 of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness.
 Because it still deals with the world of conditioned events, the Eightfold
 Path in the stage of insight is called the mundane path (lokiyamagga).
 This designation in no way implies that the path of insight is concerned
 with mundane goals, with achievements falling in the range of samsara.
 It aspires to transcendence, it leads to liberation, but its objective
 domain of contemplation still lies within the conditioned world.
 However, this mundane contemplation of the conditioned serves as the vehicle
 for reaching the unconditioned, for attaining the supramundane.
 When insight meditation reaches its climax, when it fully comprehends the
 impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of everything formed,
 the mind breaks through the conditioned and realizes the unconditioned,
 Nibbana.
 It sees Nibbana with direct vision, makes it an object of immediate realization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The breakthrough to the unconditioned is achieved by a type of consciousness
 or mental event called the supramundane path (lokuttaramagga).
 The supramundane path occurs in four stages, four "supramundane paths,"
 each marking a deeper level of realization and issuing in a fuller degree
 of liberation, the fourth and last in complete liberation.
 The four paths can be achieved in close proximity to one another — for
 those with extraordinarily sharp faculties even in the same sitting — or
 (as is more typically the case) they can be spread out over time, even
 over several lifetimes.70 The supramundane paths share in common the penetration
 of the Four Noble Truths.
 They understand them, not conceptually, but intuitively.
 They grasp them through vision, seeing them with self-validating certainty
 to be the invariable truths of existence.
 The vision of the truths which they present is complete at one moment.
 The four truths are not understood sequentially, as in the stage of reflection
 when thought is the instrument of understanding.
 They are seen simultaneously: to see one truth with the path is to see
 them all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the path penetrates the four truths, the mind exercises four simultaneous
 functions, one regarding each truth.
 It fully comprehends the truth of suffering, seeing all conditioned existence
 as stamped with the mark of unsatisfactoriness.
 At the same time it abandons craving, cuts through the mass of egotism
 and desire that repeatedly gives birth to suffering.
 Again, the mind realizes cessation, the deathless element Nibbana, now
 directly present to the inner eye.
 And fourthly, the mind develops the Noble Eightfold Path, whose eight factors
 spring up endowed with tremendous power, attained to supramundane stature:
 right view as the direct seeing of Nibbana, right intention as the mind's
 application to Nibbana, the triad of ethical factors as the checks on moral
 transgression, right effort as the energy in the path-consciousness, right
 mindfulness as the factor of awareness, and right concentration as the
 mind's one-pointed focus.
 This ability of the mind to perform four functions at the same moment is
 compared to a candle's ability to simultaneously burn the wick, consume
 the wax, dispel darkness, and give light.71
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The supramundane paths have the special task of eradicating the defilements.
 Prior to the attainment of the paths, in the stages of concentration and
 even insight meditation, the defilements were not cut off but were only
 debilitated, checked and suppressed by the training of the higher mental
 faculties.
 Beneath the surface they continued to linger in the form of latent tendencies.
 But when the supramundane paths are reached, the work of eradication begins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insofar as they bind us to the round of becoming, the defilements are classified
 into a set of ten "fetters" (samyojana) as follows: (1) personality view,
 (2) doubt, (3) clinging to rules and rituals, (4) sensual desire, (5) aversion,
 (6) desire for fine-material existence, (7) desire for immaterial existence,
 (8) conceit, (9) restlessness, and (10) ignorance.
 The four supramundane paths each eliminate a certain layer of defilements.
 The first, the path of stream-entry (sotapatti-magga), cuts off the first
 three fetters, the coarsest of the set, eliminates them so they can never
 arise again.
 "Personality view" (sakkaya-ditthi), the view of a truly existent self
 in the five aggregates, is cut off since one sees the selfless nature of
 all phenomena.
 Doubt is eliminated because one has grasped the truth proclaimed by the
 Buddha, seen it for oneself, and so can never again hang back due to uncertaint
y.
 And clinging to rules and rites is removed since one knows that deliverance
 can be won only through the practice of the Eightfold Path, not through
 rigid moralism or ceremonial observances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path is followed immediately by another state of supramundane consciousness
 known as the fruit (phala), which results from the path's work of cutting
 off defilements.
 Each path is followed by its own fruit, wherein for a few moments the mind
 enjoys the blissful peace of Nibbana before descending again to the level
 of mundane consciousness.
 The first fruit is the fruit of stream-entry, and a person who has gone
 through the experience of this fruit becomes a "stream-enterer" (sotapanna).
 He has entered the stream of the Dhamma carrying him to final deliverance.
 He is bound for liberation and can no longer fall back into the ways of
 an unenlightened worldling.
 He still has certain defilements remaining in his mental makeup, and it
 may take him as long as seven more lives to arrive at the final goal, but
 he has acquired the essential realization needed to reach it, and there
 is no way he can fall away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An enthusiastic practitioner with sharp faculties, after reaching stream-entry,
 does not relax his striving but puts forth energy to complete the entire
 path as swiftly as possible.
 He resumes his practice of insight contemplation, passes through the ascending
 stages of insight-knowledge, and in time reaches the second path, the path
 of the once-returner (sakadagami-magga).
 This supramundane path does not totally eradicate any of the fetters, but
 it attenuates the roots of greed, aversion, and delusion.
 Following the path the meditator experiences its fruit, then emerges as
 a "once-returner" who will return to this world at most only one more time
 before attaining full liberation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But our practitioner again takes up the task of contemplation.
 At the next stage of supramundane realization he attains the third path,
 the path of the non-returner (anagami-magga), with which he cuts off the
 two fetters of sensual desire and ill will.
 From that point on he can never again fall into the grip of any desire
 for sense pleasure, and can never be aroused to anger, aversion, or discontent.
 As a non-returner he will not return to the human state of existence in
 any future life.
 If he does not reach the last path in this very life, then after death
 he will be reborn in a higher sphere in the fine-material world (rupaloka)
 and there reach deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But our meditator again puts forth effort, develops insight, and at its
 climax enters the fourth path, the path of arahatship (arahatta-magga).
 With this path he cuts off the five remaining fetters — desire for fine-materia
l existence and desire for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness,
 and ignorance.
 The first is the desire for rebirth into the celestial planes made accessible
 by the four jhanas, the planes commonly subsumed under the name "the Brahma-wor
ld." The second is the desire for rebirth into the four immaterial planes
 made accessible by the achievement of the four immaterial attainments.
 Conceit (mana) is not the coarse type of pride to which we become disposed
 through an over-estimation of our virtues and talents, but the subtle residue
 of the notion of an ego which subsists even after conceptually explicit
 views of self have been eradicated.
 The texts refer to this type of conceit as the conceit "I am" (asmimana).
 Restlessness (uddhacca) is the subtle excitement which persists in any
 mind not yet completely enlightened, and ignorance (avijja) is the fundamental
 cognitive obscuration which prevents full understanding of the Four Noble
 Truths.
 Although the grosser grades of ignorance have been scoured from the mind
 by the wisdom faculty in the first three paths, a thin veil of ignorance
 overlays the truths even in the non-returner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path of arahatship strips away this last veil of ignorance and, with
 it, all the residual mental defilements.
 This path issues in perfect comprehension of the Four Noble Truths.
 It fully fathoms the truth of suffering; eradicates the craving from which
 suffering springs; realizes with complete clarity the unconditioned element,
 Nibbana, as the cessation of suffering; and consummates the development
 of the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the attainment of the fourth path and fruit the disciple emerges as
 an arahant, one who in this very life has been liberated from all bonds.
 The arahant has walked the Noble Eightfold Path to its end and lives in
 the assurance stated so often in the formula from the Pali canon: "Destroyed
 is birth; the holy life has been lived; what had to be done has been done;
 there is no coming back to any state of being." The arahant is no longer
 a practitioner of the path but its living embodiment.
 Having developed the eight factors of the path to their consummation, the
 Liberated One lives in the enjoyment of their fruits, enlightenment and
 final deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Epilogue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This completes our survey of the Noble Eightfold Path, the way to deliverance
 from suffering taught by the Buddha.
 The higher reaches of the path may seem remote from us in our present position,
 the demands of practice may appear difficult to fulfill.
 But even if the heights of realization are now distant, all that we need
 to reach them lies just beneath our feet.
 The eight factors of the path are always accessible to us; they are mental
 components which can be established in the mind simply through determination
 and effort.
 We have to begin by straightening out our views and clarifying our intentions.
 Then we have to purify our conduct — our speech, action, and livelihood.
 Taking these measures as our foundation, we have to apply ourselves with
 energy and mindfulness to the cultivation of concentration and insight.
 The rest is a matter of gradual practice and gradual progress, without
 expecting quick results.
 For some progress may be rapid, for others it may be slow, but the rate
 at which progress occurs should not cause elation or discouragement.
 Liberation is the inevitable fruit of the path and is bound to blossom
 forth when there is steady and persistent practice.
 The only requirements for reaching the final goal are two: to start and
 to continue.
 If these requirements are met there is no doubt the goal will be attained.
 This is the Dhamma, the undeviating law.

\begin_layout Standard
1.Ignorance is actually identical in nature with the unwholesome root "delusion"
 (moha).
 When the Buddha speaks in a psychological context about mental factors,
 he generally uses the word "delusion"; when he speaks about the causal
 basis of samsara, he uses the word "ignorance" (avijja).2.SN 56:11; Word

 Though kama usually means sensual desire, the context seems to allow a
 wider interpretation, as self-seeking desire in all its forms.16.AN 1:16.2.17.Strict
ly speaking, greed or desire (raga) becomes immoral only when it impels
 actions violating the basic principles of ethics, such as killing, stealing,
 adultery, etc.
 When it remains merely as a mental factor or issues in actions not inherently
 immoral — e.g., the enjoyment of good food, the desire for recognition, sexual
 relations that do not hurt others — it is not immoral but is still a form
 of craving causing bondage to suffering.18.For a full account of the dukkha
 tied up with sensual desire, see MN 13.19.This might appear to contradict
 what we said earlier, that metta is free from self-reference.
 The contradiction is only apparent, however, for in developing metta towards
 oneself one regards oneself objectively, as a third person.
 Further, the kind of love developed is not self-cherishing but a detached
 altruistic wish for one's own well-being.20.Any other formula found to be
 effective may be used in place of the formula given here.

 have to be passed through sequentially, such that there is no attainment
 of a higher path without first having reached the paths below it.
 This certainly seems to be the position of the Commentaries.
 However, the Suttas sometimes show individuals proceeding directly from
 the stage of worldling to the third or even the fourth path and fruit.
 Though the commentator explains that they passed through each preceding
 path and fruit in rapid succession, the canonical texts themselves give
 no indication that this has transpired but suggest an immediate realization
 of the higher stages without the intermediate attainment of the lower stages.71.S

In an age when the marketplace is teeming with spiritual books and teachings
 of every description, it is reassuring to know that the Buddha left behind
 clear guidelines by which we can judge the validity of a spiritual teaching.
 These eight principles, sometimes called the "Constitution of Buddhism,"
 show us that any teaching must finally be judged by the results that come
 from putting it into practice.

Stream-entry: "Stream-entry" (sotapatti) is the first of the four stages

 lead to the attainment of stream-entry and address questions of interest
 to all meditators, whether or not their practice aims all the way to Awakening.

 Selections from the Canon that explore stream-entry from several angles:
 How is stream-entry experienced? What transformations of mind and character
 occur as a result? What are its rewards? Once it is attained, what next?
 Also included is some helpful advice to meditators who have been "certified"

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An anthropologist once questioned an Eskimo shaman about his tribe's belief
 system.
 After putting up with the anthropologist's questions for a while, the shaman
 finally told him: "Look.
 We don't believe.
 We fear."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a similar way, Buddhism starts, not with a belief, but with a fear of
 very present dangers.
 As the Buddha himself reported, his initial impetus for leaving home and
 seeking Awakening was his comprehension of the great dangers that inevitably
 follow on birth: aging, illness, death, and separation.
 The Awakening he sought was one that would lead him to a happiness not
 subject to these things.
 After finding that happiness, and in attempting to show others how to find
 it for themselves, he frequently referred to the themes of aging, illness,
 death, and separation as useful objects for contemplation.
 Because of this, his teaching has often been called pessimistic, but this
 emphasis is actually like that of a doctor who focuses on the symptoms
 and causes of disease as part of an effort to bring about a cure.
 The Buddha is not afraid to dwell on these topics, because the Awakening
 he teaches brings about a total release from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study guide provides an introduction to the Buddha's teachings on aging,
 illness, death, and separation.
 The passages included here — all taken from the Pali canon — are arranged
 in five sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first section presents medical metaphors for the teaching, showing how
 the Buddha was like a doctor and how his teaching is like a course of therapy
 offering a cure for the great dangers in life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second section diagnoses the problems of aging, illness, death, and
 separation.
 This section touches briefly on the Buddha's central teaching, the four
 noble truths.
 For more information on this subject, see The Path to Freedom and the study
 guide, The Four Noble Truths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third section contains passages that use aging, illness, death, and
 separation, as reminders for diligence in the practice.
 The central passage here is a set of five recollections, in which recollection
 of aging, illness, death, and separation forms a background for a fifth
 recollection: the power of one's actions to shape one's experience.
 In other words, the first four recollections present the dangers of life;
 the fifth indicates the way in which those dangers may be overcome, through
 developing skill in one's own thoughts, words, and deeds.
 Useful articles to read in conjunction with this section are Affirming
 the Truths of the Heart, Karma, and The Road to Nirvana is Paved with Skillful
 Intentions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth section contains passages that give specific advice on how to
 deal with problems of aging, etc.
 The Buddha's teachings on kamma provide an important underpinning for how
 problems of pain and illness are approached in this section.
 Given the fact that the experience of the present moment is shaped both
 by past and by present intentions, it is possible that — if an illness
 is the result of present intentions — a change of mind can effect a cure
 in the illness; but if the illness is the result of past intentions, a
 change of mind may have no effect on the illness but can at least protect
 the mind from being adversely affected by it.
 Thus some of the passages focus how practicing the Dhamma can cure a person
 of illness, whereas others focus on how the Dhamma can ensure that, even
 though a person may die from an illness, the illness will make no inroads
 on the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fifth section gives examples of how the Buddha and his disciples skillfully
 negotiated the problems of aging, illness, death, and separation.

§3.
 Once the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa forest.
 Then, picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand, he asked the monks,
 "What do you think, monks: Which are more numerous, the few Simsapa leaves
 in my hand or those overhead in the Simsapa forest?"

 Those overhead in the forest are far more numerous."

\begin_layout Standard
"In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge
 but have not taught are far more numerous [than what I have taught].
 And why haven't I taught them? Because they are not connected with the
 goal, do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead
 to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge,
 to self-awakening, to Unbinding.
 That is why I have not taught them.

"And what have I taught? 'This is stress...
 This is the origination of stress...

 them well, considered them well, penetrated them well by means of discernment
 — so that in answering you will speak in line with what the Blessed One
 has said, will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual,
 will answer in line with the Dhamma, and no one whose thinking is in line

§10.
 On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove,
 Anathapindika's monastery.
 Then Rohitassa, the son of a deva, in the far extreme of the night, his
 extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, went to the
 Blessed One.
 On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he stood to one side.
 As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One: "Is it possible, lord,
 by traveling, to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one
 does not take birth, age, die, pass away or reappear?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I tell you, friend, that it is not possible by traveling to know or see
 or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth, age, die,
 pass away, or reappear."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is amazing, lord, and awesome, how well that has been said by the Blessed
 One: 'I tell you, friend, that it is not possible by traveling to know
 or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth,
 age, die, pass away, or reappear.' Once I was a seer named Rohitassa, a
 student of Bhoja, a powerful sky-walker.
 My speed was as fast as that of a strong archer — well-trained, a practiced
 hand, a practiced sharp-shooter — shooting a light arrow across the shadow
 of a palm tree.
 My stride stretched as far as the east sea is from the west.
 To me, endowed with such speed, such a stride, there came the desire: 'I
 will go traveling to the end of the cosmos.' I — with a one-hundred year
 life, a one-hundred year span — spent one hundred years traveling — apart
 from the time spent on eating, drinking, chewing & tasting, urinating &
 defecating, and sleeping to fight off weariness — but without reaching
 the end of the cosmos I died along the way.
 So it is amazing, lord, and awesome, how well that has been said by the
 Blessed One: 'I tell you, friend, that it is not possible by traveling
 to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take
 birth, age, die, pass away, or reappear.'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[When this was said, the Blessed One responded:] "I tell you, friend, that
 it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the
 cosmos where one does not take birth, age, die, pass away, or reappear.
 But at the same time, I tell you that there is no making an end of suffering
 & stress without reaching the end of the cosmos.
 Yet it is just within this fathom-long body, with its perception & intellect,
 that I declare that there is the cosmos, the origination of the cosmos,
 the cessation of the cosmos, and the path of practice leading to the cessation
 of the cosmos."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's not to be reached by traveling, the end of the cosmos — regardless.
 And it's not without reaching the end of the cosmos that there is release
 from suffering & stress.
 So, truly, the wise one, an expert with regard to the cosmos, a knower
 of the end of the cosmos, having fulfilled the holy life, calmed, knowing
 the cosmos' end, does not long for this cosmos or any other.

 I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi
 in the Game Refuge at Isipatana.
 There he addressed the group of five monks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who
 has gone forth.
 Which two? That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to
 sensual objects: base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unprofitable; and that
 which is devoted to self-affliction: painful, ignoble, unprofitable.
 Avoiding both of these extremes, the middle way realized by the Tathagata
 — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge,
 to self-awakening, to Unbinding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision,
 producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening,
 to Unbinding? Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right resolve,
 right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
 right concentration.
 This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision,
 producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening,
 to Unbinding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging
 is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress,
 & despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful, separatio
n from the loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful.
 In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And this, monks, is the noble truth of the origination of stress: the craving
 that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion & delight, relishing
 now here & now there — i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for becoming,
 craving for non-becoming.
\end_layout

 Now at that time the dear and beloved only son of a certain lay follower
 had died.
 So a large number of lay followers — their clothes wet, their hair wet
 — went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having
 bowed down to him, sat to one side.
 As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them: "Why have you
 come here — your clothes wet, your hair wet — in the middle of the day?"

§31.
 I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi
 at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery.
 Now at that time a certain householder's dear & beloved little son, his
 only child, had died.
 Because of his death, the father had no desire to work or to eat.
 He kept going to the cemetery and crying out, "Where have you gone, my
 only little child? Where have you gone, my only little child?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him,
 sat to one side.

 There is an aberration in your faculties."

"Lord, how could there not be an aberration in my faculties? My dear & beloved

[Ven.
 Ratthapala:]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I see in the world people with wealth who, from delusion, don't make a gift
 of the treasure they've gained.
 Greedy, they stash it away, hoping for even more sensual pleasures.
 A king who, by force, has conquered the world and rules over the earth
 to the edge of the sea, dissatisfied with the ocean's near shore, longs
 for the ocean's far shore as well.
 Kings & others — plenty of people — go to death with craving unabated.
 Unsated they leave the body behind, having not had enough of the world's
 sensual pleasures.
 One's relatives weep & pull out their hair.
 'Oh woe, our loved one is dead,' they cry.
 Carrying him off, wrapped in a piece of cloth, they place him on a pyre,
 then set him on fire.
 So he burns, poked with sticks, in just one piece of cloth, leaving all
 his possessions behind.
 They are not shelters for one who has died — not relatives, friends, or
 companions.
 His heirs take over his wealth, while the being goes on, in line with his
 kamma.
 No wealth at all follows the dead one — not children, wives, dominion,
 or riches.
 Long life can't be gotten with wealth, nor aging warded off with treasure.
 The wise say this life is next to nothing — impermanent, subject to change.
 The rich & the poor touch the touch of Death.
 The foolish & wise are touched by it, too.
 But while fools lie as if slain by their folly, the wise don't tremble
 when touched by the touch.
 Thus the discernment by which one attains to mastery, is better than wealth
 — for those who haven't reached mastery go from existence to existence,
 out of delusion, doing bad deeds.
 One goes to a womb & to the next world, falling into the wandering on —

 one, also go to a womb & to the next world.
 Just as an evil thief caught at the break-in is destroyed by his own act,
 so evil people — after dying, in the next world — are destroyed by their
 own acts.
 Sensual pleasures — variegated, enticing, sweet — in various ways disturb
 the mind.
 Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects: that's why, O king, I went forth.
 Just like fruits, people fall — young & old — at the break-up of the body.
 Knowing this, O king, I went forth.

Going forth through conviction from home into homelessness, I wandered this
 place & that, greedy for gain & offerings.
 Missing out on the foremost goal, I pursued a lowly one.
 Under the sway of defilements I surrendered the goal of the contemplative
 life.
 Then, sitting in my dwelling, I suddenly came to my senses: I'm following
 a miserable path.
 I'm under the sway of craving.
 Next to nothing, my life, crushed by aging & illness.
 Before the body breaks apart, I have no time for heedlessness.
 After watching, as it actually was, the rising & falling of aggregates,
 I stood up with mind released, the Awakened One's bidding done.

1.Rahula: the Buddha's son, who according to the Commentary was seven years
 old when this discourse was delivered to him.2.Samañña.
 Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe
 the moral quality of people and acts.
 Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors
 for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments were metaphors
 for good.
 In Pali, the termsama — "even" — described an instrument tuned on-pitch.
 There is a famous passage where the Buddha reminds Sona Kolivisa — who
 had been over-exerting himself in the practice — that a lute sounds appealing
 only if the strings are neither too taut or too lax, but "evenly" tuned.
 This image would have special resonance with the Buddha's teaching on the
 middle way.
 It also adds meaning to the termsamana — monk or contemplative — which
 the texts frequently mention as being derived fromsama.
 The wordsamañña — "evenness," the quality of being in tune — also means
 the quality of being a contemplative: the true contemplative is always
 in tune with what is proper and good.

When a house is on fire, the vessel salvaged is the one that will be of
 use, not the one left there to burn.
 So when the world is on fire with aging & death, one should salvage [one's

 What's given bears fruit as pleasure.
 What isn't given does not: thieves take it away, or kings; it gets burnt
 by fire or lost.
 Then in the end one leaves the body together with one's possessions.
 Knowing this, the intelligent man enjoys possessions & gives.

 They don't exist when there's nothing dear.
 And thus blissful & sorrowless are those for whom nothing in the world
 is anywhere dear.
 So one who aspires to be stainless & sorrowless shouldn't make anything
 in the world dear anywhere.

 On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove,
 Anathapindika's monastery.
 Now at that time Ven.
 Sariputta was staying among the Magadhans in Nalaka village — diseased,
 in pain, severely ill.
 Cunda the novice was his attendant.
 Then, because of that illness, Ven.
 Sariputta attained total Unbinding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Cunda the novice, taking Ven.
 Sariputta's bowl & robes, went to Ven.
 Ananda in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery, near Savatthi, and on
 arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.
 As he was sitting there he said to Ven.
 Ananda: "Venerable sir, Ven.
 Sariputta has attained total Unbinding.
 Here are his bowl & robes."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Cunda, my friend, this news is reason for seeing the Blessed One.
 Come, let's go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him."

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes, venerable sir," Cunda the novice replied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Ven.
 Ananda & Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having
 bowed down to him, sat to one side.
 As they were sitting there, Ven.
 Ananda said to him, "Lord, just now Cunda the novice said to me, 'Venerable
 sir, Ven.
 Sariputta has attained total Unbinding.
 Here are his bowl & robes.' It was as if my body were drugged, I lost my
 bearings, things weren't clear to me, on hearing that Ven.
 Sariputta had attained total Unbinding."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But, Ananda, when he attained total Unbinding, did Sariputta take the aggregate

 discernment...
 release...
 the aggregate of knowledge & vision of release along with him?"

\begin_layout Standard
"No, lord, when he attained total Unbinding, Ven.
 Sariputta didn't take the aggregate of virtue...
 concentration...

 release...
 the aggregate of knowledge & vision of release along with him.
 It's just that he was my instructor & counselor, one who exhorted, urged,
 roused, & encouraged me.
 He was tireless in teaching the Dhamma, a help to his companions in the
 holy life.
 We miss the nourishment of his Dhamma, the wealth of his Dhamma, his help
 in the Dhamma."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But, Ananda, haven't I already taught you the state of growing different
 with regard to all things dear & appealing, the state of becoming separate,
 the state of becoming otherwise? What else is there to expect? It's impossible
 that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated, & subject to
 disintegration from disintegrating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Just as if the largest limb were to fall off of a great tree composed of
 heartwood, standing firm; in the same way, Sariputta has attained total
 Unbinding from this great community of monks composed of heartwood, standing

Ten children I bore from this physical heap.
 Then weak from that, aged, I went to a nun.
 She taught me the Dhamma: aggregates, sense spheres, & elements.
 Hearing the Dhamma, I cut off my hair and ordained.
 Having purified the divine eye while still a probationer, I know my previous
 lives, where I lived in the past.
 I develop the theme-less meditation, well-focused singleness.
 I gain the liberation of immediacy — from lack of clinging, unbound.
 The five aggregates, comprehended, stand like a tree with its root cut
 through.
 I spit on old age.
 There is now no further becoming.

 Maha Kassapa went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down

 As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him, "You are now old,

 So wear robes donated by householders, eat invitational meals, and live
 close by me."

 I have worn only one set of the triple robe and have extolled wearing only

§95.
 Then, when the Blessed One had entered the Rains Retreat, there arose a
 severe illness within him.
 Sharp & deadly were the pains, but he bore them mindfully, alert, & unperturbed.
 The thought occurred to him, "It would not be proper for me to enter total
 Unbinding without addressing my attendants & without taking leave of the
 community of monks.
 Why don't I, suppressing this illness with persistence, remain resolved
 on the fabrication of life?" So he suppressed the illness with persistence
 & remained resolved on the fabrication of life.
 His illness abated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he recovered from the illness.
 Soon after his recovery he came out of his dwelling & sat down in the shade
 of the building, on a seat prepared for him.
 Then Ven.
 Ananda approached him and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to
 one side.
 As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "What a happy sight
 to see the Blessed One in comfort! What a happy sight to see the Blessed
 One at ease! Because of the Blessed One's sickness my own body felt as
 if it were drugged.
 I lost my bearings.
 Things were unclear to me.
 Yet I still took a measure of comfort in the thought that the Blessed One
 would not enter total Unbinding as long as he hadn't given at least some
 pronouncement concerning the community of monks."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What more does the community of monks want from me, Ananda? I have taught
 the Dhamma without an inner or an outer version.
 The Tathagata has no closed fist with regard to teachings.
 Whoever has the thought, 'I will rule the community of monks,' or 'The
 community of monks is dedicated to me,'he should give some pronouncement
 concerning the community of monks.
 But the Tathagata has no such thoughts.
 So why should he give some pronouncement concerning the community of monks?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I am old now, Ananda, & aged.
 My years have turned eighty.
 Just as an old cart is kept going with the help of bamboo strips, it seems
 to me as if the Tathagata's body is kept going with the help of bamboo
 strips.
 The only time the Tathagata's body feels at ease is when, not attending
 to any theme at all, and with the cessation of certain feelings, he enters
 & remains in the theme-less concentration of awareness.
 Therefore each of you should remain with your self as an island, your self
 as your refuge, without anything else as a refuge.
 Remain with the Dhamma as an island, the Dhamma as your refuge, without
 anything else as a refuge.
 And how does a monk remain with his self as an island, his self as his
 refuge, without anything else as a refuge? How does he remain with the
 Dhamma as an island, the Dhamma as his refuge, without anything else as

 For those who — now or after I am gone — remain with their self as an island...

 The rock is diverted and shattered, but a splinter of the rock pierces

 is no fear in death.
 I have lived well the holy life, well-developed the path.
 Death holds no fear for me.
 It's like the end of a disease.
 I have lived well the holy life, well-developed the path.
 I have seen states of becoming as devoid of allure, like poison spit out

 One gone to the far shore without clinging without effluent his task completed,
 welcomes the ending of life, as if freed from a place of execution.
 Having attained the supreme Rightness, unconcerned with all the world,
 as if released from a burning house, he does not sorrow at death.
 Whatever is compounded, wherever a state of becoming is obtained, all that
 has no one in charge: so says the Great Seer.
 Whoever discerns this, as taught by the Awakened One, would no more grasp
 hold of any state of becoming than he would a hot iron ball.
 I have no "I was," no "I will be." Processes will simply go out of existence.
 What's to lament there in that? For one who sees, as it actually is, the
 pure arising of phenomena, the pure seriality of processes, there's no
 fear.
 When seeing the world with discernment as on a par with grass & twigs,
 finding no "mine-ness," thinking, "There is nothing of mine," he feels
 no sorrow.
 I am dissatisfied with this carcass, unconcerned with becoming.

 'I am the tongue' or 'The tongue is mine,'...
 'I am the intellect' or 'The intellect is mine.' So what alteration should
 there be in my body, what change should there be in my faculties?"

Now, Ven.
 Upasena's I-making, my-making, & obsession with conceit had already been

 "I am the tongue" or "The tongue is mine,"...

 Revata's Farewell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since I went forth from home into homelessness, I haven't known an ignoble,
 aversive resolve.
 "May these beings be destroyed, be slaughtered, fall into pain" — I've
 not known this resolve in this long, long time.
 But I have known good will, unlimited, fully developed, nurtured step after
 step, as taught by the One Awake: to all, a friend; to all, a comrade;
 for all beings, sympathetic.
 And I develop a mind of good will, delighting in non-malevolance — always.
 Unvanquised, unshaken, I gladden the mind.
 I develop the sublime abiding, not frequented by the lowly.
 Attaining no-thinking, the disciple of the Rightly Self-awakened One is
 endowed with noble silence straightaway.
 As a mountain of rock is unmoving, firmly established, so a monk, with
 the ending of delusion, like a mountain, doesn't quake.
 To a person without blemish, constantly in search of what's pure, a hair-tip
 of evil seems a storm cloud.
 As a frontier fortress is guarded within & without, you should safeguard
 yourselves.
 Don't let the moment pass you by.
 I don't delight in death, don't delight in living.
 I await my time like a worker his wage.
 I don't delight in death, don't delight in living.
 I await my time mindful, alert.
 The Teacher has been served by me; the Awakened One's bidding, done; the
 heavy load, laid down; the guide to becoming, uprooted.
 And the goal for which I went forth from home life into homelessness I've
 reached: the end of all fetters.
 Attain completion through heedfulness: that is my message.
 So then, I'm about to be unbound.
 I'm released everywhere.

 Now, when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and, sitting cross-legged

 ashes nor soot could be discerned.

 Then [after relinquishing the will to continue fabricating his life processes]
 the Blessed One went to the audience hall and on arrival sat down on the
 seat prepared for him.
 When he was seated, he addressed the monks: "The qualities I have pointed
 out, having known them directly: You should grasp them thoroughly, cultivate
 them, develop them, & pursue them so that this holy life may long endure
 & remain steadfast for the benefit, welfare, & happiness of the multitude,
 out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, & happiness of
 human & celestial beings.
 And what are those qualities? The four frames of reference, the four right
 exertions, the four bases of power, the five faculties, the five strengths,
 the seven factors for Awakening, the noble eightfold path.
 These are the qualities I have pointed out, having known them directly,
 that you should grasp thoroughly, cultivate, develop, & pursue...
 for the benefit, welfare, & happiness of human & celestial beings." Then
 the Blessed One addressed the monks, "I exhort you, monks: All fabrications

 Bring about completion by means of heedfulness.
 It will not be long before the Tathagata's total Unbinding.
 He will attain total Unbinding in three month's time."

Then the Blessed One with a large community of monks went to the far shore

 Heavenly coral-tree blossoms are falling from the sky...
 Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky...
 Heavenly music is playing in the sky...
 Heavenly songs are sung in the sky, in homage to the Tathagata.
 But it is not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped, honored, respected

 Rather, the monk, nun, male lay follower, or female lay follower who keeps
 practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, who keeps practicing
 masterfully, who lives in accordance with the Dhamma: that is the person
 who worships, honors, respects, venerates, & pays homage to the Tathagata

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total
 Unbinding, some of the monks present who were not without passion wept,
 uplifting their arms.
 As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fell down and rolled
 back & forth, crying, "All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound!
 All too soon is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One
 with Eyes has disappeared from the world!" But those monks who were free
 from passion acquiesced, mindful & alert: "Fabrications are inconstant.
 What else is there to expect?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Ven.
 Anuruddha addressed the monks, "Enough, friends.
 Don't grieve.
 Don't lament.
 Hasn't the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with
 regard to all things dear & appealing, the state of becoming separate,
 the state of becoming otherwise? What else is there to expect? It's impossible
 that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated, & subject to
 disintegration from disintegrating.
 The devatas, friends, are complaining."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Ananda:] "But, Ven.
 Anuruddha, what is the state of the devatas the Blessed One is referring
 to?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Friend Ananda, there are devatas who perceive space to be earth.
 Tearing at their hair, they are weeping.
 Uplifting their arms, they are weeping.
 As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fall down and roll

 All too soon is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although early Buddhism is widely believed to take a negative attitude toward
 the body, the texts of the Pali canon do not support this belief.
 They approach the body both in its positive role, as an object of meditation
 to develop mindfulness, concentration, and the mental powers based on concentra
tion; and in its negative role as an object for unskillful states of mind.
 Even in its negative role, the body is not the culprit: the problem is
 the mind's attachment to the body.
 Once the body can be used in its positive role, to develop mindfulness
 and concentration, those mental qualities can be used to free the mind
 of its attachments to the body.
 Then, as many a modern meditation master has noted, the mind and body can
 live in peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study guide focuses on the primary sutta in the Pali canon dealing
 with the contemplation of the body: The Discourse on Mindfulness Immersed
 in the Body (MN 119).
 The first section, The Context, establishes the general principles underlying
 the practice of mindfulness immersed in the body, showing why attachment
 to the body is considered problematic in the first place.
 The second section presents the sutta itself.
 The remaining sections expand on points raised in the sutta: Section Three
 dealing with the advantages of practicing mindfulness immersed in the body,
 and Section Four expanding on the drawbacks of attachment to the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the sutta treats the body both as an object of mindfulness and as
 an object of jhana, or mental absorption, it raises questions concerning
 the relationship between these two mental qualities in the practice of
 meditation.
 There is a widespread belief that they represent two sides of a great divide
 in Buddhist meditation practice, with mindfulness on one side, joined with
 vipassana (insight) and discernment; and jhana on the other side joined
 with samatha (tranquillity).
 The Pali canon, however, presents a much more complex picture of the interrelat
ed roles these mental qualities in the pursuit of Awakening.
 And in fact, the "Great Divide" picture of Buddhist meditation practice
 conflates what the Pali canon treats as three separate, albeit related
 issues: the relationship between samatha and vipassana, the relationship
 between mindfulness and jhana, and the relationship between jhana and discernme
nt.
 To convey the original parameters of these issues, this study guide ends
 with three sections focused on precisely these relationships.

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi
 at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery.
 Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning
 from their alms round, had gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion
 arose: "Isn't it amazing, friends! Isn't it astounding! — the extent to
 which mindfulness immersed in the body, when developed & pursued, is said
 by the Blessed One who knows, who sees — the worthy one, rightly self-awakened
 — to be of great fruit & great benefit." And this discussion came to no
 conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon,
 went to the meeting hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready.

Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.To the fore (parimukham): The Abhidhamma takes an etymological approach
 to this term, defining it as around (pari-) the mouth (mukham).
 In the Vinaya, however, it is used in a context (Cv.V.27.4) where it undoubtedly
 means the front of the chest.
 There is also the possibility that the term could be used idiomatically
 as "to the front," which is how I have translated it here.2.The commentaries
 insist that "body" here means the breath, but this is unlikely in this
 context, for the next step — without further explanation — refers to the
 breath as "bodily fabrication." If the Buddha were using two different terms
 to refer to the breath in such close proximity, he would have been careful
 to signal that he was redefining his terms (as he does below, when explaining
 that the first four steps in breath meditation correspond to the practice
 of focusing on the body in and of itself as a frame of reference).
 The step of breathing in and out sensitive to the entire body relates to
 the many similes in the suttas depicting jhana as a state of whole-body
 awareness (see MN 119).3."In-&-out breaths are bodily; these are things tied
 up with the body.
 That's why in-&-out breaths are bodily fabrications." — MN 44.4."Perceptions
 & feelings are mental; these are things tied up with the mind.
 That's why perceptions & feelings are mental fabrications." — MN 44.5.AN 9.34
 shows how the mind, step by step, is temporarily released from burdensome
 mental states of greater and greater refinement as it advances through
 the stages of jhana.6.As this shows, a meditator focusing on feelings in
 themselves as a frame of reference should not abandon the breath as the
 basis for his/her concentration.

 of a fawn, like those of a sprite in the mountains.
 Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the more.
 Like tips they are, of blue lotuses, in your golden face — spotless: Seeing
 your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the more.
 Even if you should go far away, I will think only of your pure, long-lashed
 gaze, for there is nothing dearer to me than your eyes, O nymph with the
 languid regard.' 'You want to stray from the road, you want the moon as
 a plaything, you want to jump over Mount Sineru, you who have designs on
 one born of the Buddha.
 For there is nothing anywhere at all in the cosmos with its gods, that
 would be an object of passion for me.
 I don't even know what that passion would be, for it's been killed, root
 & all, by the path.
 Like embers from a pit — scattered, like a bowl of poison — evaporated,
 I don't even see what that passion would be, for it's been killed, root
 & all, by the path.
 Try to seduce one who hasn't reflected on this, or who has not followed
 the Master's teaching.
 But try it with this one who knows and you suffer.
 For in the midst of praise & blame, pleasure & pain, my mindfulness stands
 firm.
 Knowing the unattractiveness of things compounded, my mind cleaves to nothing
 at all.
 I am a follower of the one well-gone, riding the vehicle of the eightfold
 way: My arrow removed, effluent-free, I delight, having gone to an empty
 dwelling.
 For I have seen well-painted puppets, hitched up with sticks & strings,
 made to dance in various ways.
 When the sticks & strings are removed, thrown away, scattered, shredded,
 smashed into pieces, not to be found, in what will the mind there make
 its home? This body of mine, which is just like that, when devoid of dhammas
 doesn't function.
 When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn't function, in what will the mind there
 make its home? Like a mural you've seen, painted on a wall, smeared with
 yellow orpiment, there your vision has been distorted, meaningless your
 human perception.
 Like an evaporated mirage, like a tree of gold in a dream, like a magic
 show in the midst of a crowd — you run blind after what is unreal.
 Resembling a ball of sealing wax, set in a hollow, with a bubble in the
 middle and bathed with tears, eye secretions are born there too: The parts
 of the eye are rolled all together in various ways.' Plucking out her lovely
 eye, with mind unattached she felt no regret.
 'Here, take this eye.
 It's yours.' Straightaway she gave it to him.
 Straightaway his passion faded right there, and he begged her forgiveness.
 'Be well, follower of the holy life.
 This sort of thing won't happen again.
 Harming a person like you is like embracing a blazing fire, It is as if
 I have seized a poisonous snake.
 So may you be well.
 Forgive me.' And released from there, the nun went to the excellent Buddha's
 presence.
 When she saw the mark of his excellent merit, her eye became as it was
 before.

 lac, she wore slippers: a courtesan.
 Stepping out of her slippers — her hands raised before me, palm-to-palm
 over her heart — she softly, tenderly, in measured words spoke to me first:
 "You are young, recluse.
 Heed my message: Partake of human sensuality.
 I will give you luxury.
 Truly I vow to you, I will tend to you as to a fire.
 When we are old, both leaning on canes, then we will both become contemplatives

 Headed surely to death, in the presence of the King of Mortality, the man

 Covered with ignorance, the body's tied down with a four-fold tie,[1] sunk

 That's how the body functions, compelled by the compulsion of kamma, but

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four noble truths are the most basic expression of the Buddha's teaching.
 As Ven.
 Sariputta once said, they encompass the entire teaching, just as the footprint
 of an elephant can encompass the footprints of all other footed beings
 on earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These four truths are best understood, not as beliefs, but as categories
 of experience.
 They offer an alternative to the ordinary way we categorize what we can
 know and describe, in terms of me/not me, and being/not being.
 These ordinary categories create trouble, for the attempt to maintain full
 being for one's sense of "me" is a stressful effort doomed to failure,
 in that all of the components of that "me" are inconstant, stressful, and
 thus not worthy of identifying as "me" or "mine."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To counter this problem, the four noble truths drop ideas of me/not me,
 and being/not being, and replace them with two sets of variables: cause
 and effect, skillful and unskillful.
 In other words, there is the truth of stress and suffering (unskillful
 effect), the truth of the origination of stress (unskillful cause), the
 truth of the cessation of stress (skillful effect), and the truth of the
 path to the cessation of stress (skillful cause).
 Each of these truths entails a duty: stress is to be comprehended, the
 origination of stress abandoned, the cessation of stress realized, and
 the path to the cessation of stress developed.
 When all of these duties have been fully performed, the mind gains total
 release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many people have charged Buddhism with being pessimistic because the four
 truths start out with stress and suffering, but this charge misses the
 fact that the first truth is part of a strategy of diagnosis and therapy
 focusing on the basic problem in life so as to offer a solution to it.
 Thus the Buddha was like a doctor, focusing on the disease he wanted to
 cure.
 Charging him with pessimism is like charging a doctor with pessimism when
 he asks, "Where does it hurt?" The total cure the Buddha promised as a
 result of his course of therapy shows that, in actuality, he was much less
 pessimistic than the vast majority of the world, for whom wisdom means
 accepting the bad things in life with the good, assuming that there is
 no chance in this life for unalloyed happiness.
 The Buddha was an extremely demanding person, unwilling to bend to this
 supposed wisdom or to rest with anything less than absolute happiness.
 His course of therapy points to the fact that such a happiness is possible,
 and can be attained through our own efforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another charge often leveled at Buddhism is that its focus is narrow, aiming
 only at the issue of stress and pain, and ignoring the larger or more uplifting
 issues of spiritual life.
 This, again, misses the thrust of the Buddha's cure for the ills of the
 heart and mind.
 One of the most important insights leading up to the Buddha's Awakening
 was his realization that the act of comprehending pain lay at the essence
 of the spiritual quest.
 In trying to comprehend pain, one begins to delve into the non-verbal,
 subconscious levels of the mind, bringing to light many ill-formed and
 hidden processes of which one was previously unaware.
 In this sense, pain is like a watering hole where all the animals in the
 forest — all the mind's subconscious tendencies — will eventually come
 to drink.
 Just as a naturalist who wants to make a survey of the wildlife in a particular
 area can simply station himself near a watering hole, in the same way,
 a meditator who wants to understand the mind can simply keep watch right
 at pain in order to see what subconscious reactions will appear.
 Thus the act of trying to comprehend pain leads not only to an improved
 understanding of pain itself, but also to an increased awareness of the
 most basic processes at work in the mind.
 As one fully comprehends pain, one gains a full comprehension of other
 spiritual issues as well, realizing which questions were worth asking and
 which ones weren't, at the same time gaining answers to the first set of
 questions and learning how to put the second set aside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the study of the four noble truths is aimed first at understanding
 these four categories, and then at applying them to experience so that
 one may act properly toward each of the categories and thus attain the
 highest, most total happiness possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The material in this study guide starts with a basic exercise in categorizing
 one's actions in terms of the variables at the heart of the four noble
 truths: cause and effect, and skillful and unskillful.
 It then builds on this understanding by discussing the role of the four
 noble truths in the course of the practice, and then analyzing in detail
 each of the truths, together with the duty appropriate to each.
 Further related readings can be found in the book, The Wings to Awakening.

The Buddha: "In the same way, Rahula, bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental
 acts are to be done with repeated reflection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Whenever you want to perform a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This
 bodily act I want to perform — would it lead to self-affliction, to the
 affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with
 painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that
 it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both;
 it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful
 results, then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to
 do.
 But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction...
 it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results,
 then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do.

 the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life.
 Having confessed it...
 you should exercise restraint in the future.

 it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then
 you should stay mentally refreshed & joyful, training day & night in skillful

Once the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa tree grove.
 Then, picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand, he asked the monks,
 "What do you think, monks: Which are more numerous, the few Simsapa leaves
 in my hand or those overhead in the Simsapa grove?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number, lord.
 Those overhead in the grove are far more numerous."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge
 but have not taught are far more numerous than the things I have taught.
 And why haven't I taught them? Because they are not connected with the
 goal, do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead
 to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge,
 to self-awakening, to Unbinding.
 That is why I have not taught them.

"And what have I taught? 'This is stress...
 This is the origination of stress...

"And what is the result of stress? There are some cases in which a person
 overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats
 his breast, & becomes bewildered.

 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?' I tell you, monks, that stress
 results either in bewilderment or in search.

\begin_layout Standard
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all the concepts central to Buddhism, merit (puñña) is one of the least
 known and least appreciated in the West.
 This is perhaps because the pursuit of merit seems to be a lowly practice,
 focused on getting and "selfing," whereas higher Buddhist practice focuses
 on letting go, particularly of any sense of self.
 Because we in the West often feel pressed for time, we don't want to waste
 our time on lowly practices, and instead want to go straight to the higher
 levels.
 Yet the Buddha repeatedly warns that the higher levels cannot be practiced
 in a stable manner unless they develop on a strong foundation.
 The pursuit of merit provides that foundation.
 To paraphrase a modern Buddhist psychologist, one cannot wisely let go
 of one's sense of self until one has developed a wise sense of self.
 The pursuit of merit is the Buddhist way to develop a wise sense of self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following readings show how this is done.
 They begin with a section on basic wisdom, which shows how the questions
 that lead ultimately to the wisdom of letting go first focus on things
 to hold onto: the skillful traits that, on the beginning level, provide
 a secure place to stand while letting go of character traits that are obviously
 harmful.
 Buddhist wisdom famously focuses in the characteristics of inconstancy,
 stress, and not-self, but the application of that wisdom grows out of the
 pursuit of what is relatively constant and pleasant, and requires a mature
 sense of self: able to plan for the future, to sacrifice short-term happiness
 for long-term happiness, to consider the needs of others, and to develop
 a strong sense of self-reliance in the pursuit of a happiness that is wise,
 pure, and compassionate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The section on merit then sets out in general terms the types of meritorious
 activities that conduce to that happiness, focusing primarily on three:
 giving, virtue, and meditation.
 The next three sections focus on the ways in which each of these activities
 can be pursued so as to produce the most happiness.
 For instance, the section on giving discusses how the happiness of generosity
 can be maximized by wisely choosing the proper motivation for giving a
 gift, a proper gift, and a proper recipient for one's gift.
 The section of virtue shows how to learn from one's past mistakes without
 succumbing to debilitating feelings of guilt.
 The section on meditation discusses not only how the development of good
 will — the meditative practice most often cited in conjunction with merit
 — can lead to happiness both now and in the present, but also how it can
 help minimize the bad results of one's past unwise actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All three of these forms of merit conduce to the highest form of merit:
 the realization of stream-entry, the first glimpse of the deathless.
 Thus the penultimate section of this study guide focuses on the happiness
 and well-being that derive from this attainment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all the rewards of meritorious action, however, the concluding section
 serves as a reminder that the pursuit of happiness ultimately leads beyond
 the pursuit of merit.
 In fact, this study guide is planned as part of a two-part study guide
 covering the Buddhist approach to the pursuit of happiness, with the second
 part discussing the teachings on the three characteristics as the next
 stage in this approach as they lead to the deathless happiness attained
 with arahantship.
 Still, it would be a mistake to view the two stages as radically separate.
 In the course of developing a wise sense of self in the pursuit of merit,
 one is already learning how to let go of unwise ways of "selfing" as one
 learns to overcome stinginess, apathy, and hard-heartedness through the
 development of giving, virtue, and good will.
 The teachings on the three characteristics simply carry this same process
 of "de-selfing" for the sake of an even truer happiness to a higher pitch.

 will be aroused & not lax; my mindfulness established & not confused; my
 body calm & not aroused; my mind centered & unified.' Having made himself
 his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what
 is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy,

So, aiming at Suppabuddha the leper, the Blessed One gave a step-by-step
 talk, i.e., a talk on generosity, on virtue, on heaven; he declared the drawbacks
, degradation, & corruption of sensual passions, and the rewards of renunciation.
 Then when he saw that Suppabuddha the leper's mind was ready, malleable,
 free from hindrances, elated, & bright, he then gave the Dhamma-talk peculiar
 to Awakened Ones, i.e., stress, origination, cessation, & path.
 And just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would properly absorb a dye,

 — to say nothing of the times I was a local king.
 The thought occurred to me: 'Of what action of mine is this the fruit,
 of what action the result, that I now have such great power & might?' Then

 He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful,

 Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what
 is not given.
 He does not take the ungiven property of another, whether in a village

 Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.
 He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their
 mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives,

 If he doesn't know, he says, 'I don't know.' If he does know, he says, 'I
 know.' If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says,
 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake,
 for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward.
 Abandoning divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech.
 What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart
 from these people here.
 What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart
 from those people there.
 Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are
 united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things
 that create concord.
 Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech.
 He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that
 go to the heart, that are polite, appealing & pleasing to people at large.
 Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter.
 He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with

 the state of peace: Be capable, upright, & straightforward, easy to instruct,
 gentle, & not conceited, content & easy to support, with few duties, living
 lightly, with peaceful faculties, masterful, modest, & no greed for supporters.
 Do not do the slightest thing that the wise would later censure.
 Think: Happy, at rest, may all beings be happy at heart.
 Whatever beings there may be, weak or strong, without exception, long,
 large, middling, short, subtle, blatant, seen & unseen, near & far, born
 & seeking birth: May all beings be happy at heart.
 Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere, or through anger
 or irritation wish for another to suffer.
 As a mother would risk her life to protect her child, her only child, even
 so should one cultivate a limitless heart with regard to all beings.
 With good will for the entire cosmos, cultivate a limitless heart: Above,
 below, & all around, unobstructed, without hostility or hate.
 Whether standing, walking, sitting, or lying down, as long as one is alert,
 one should be resolved on this mindfulness.

\begin_layout Standard
1.The Abhassara, Subhakinha, and Vehapphala devas are all Brahmas on the
 level of form.2.This sutta, read in conjunction with AN 4.123, has given rise
 to the belief that the development of good will as an immeasurable state
 can lead only to the first jhana, and that the next two immeasurable states
 — compassion and appreciation — can lead, respectively, only to the second
 and third jhanas.
 However, as AN 8.63 shows below, all four immeasurable states can lead all
 the way to the fourth jhana.
 The difference between that discourse and this lies in how the person practicin
g these states relates to them.
 In that sutta, the person deliberately uses the state as a basis for developing
 all the jhanas.
 In this sutta, the person simply enjoys the state and remains in it.

"This is the purpose for conversation, this is the purpose for consultation,

 ear: the liberation of the mind through non-clinging."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This quotation from chapter 12 of the Parivara, the appendix to the Vinaya,
 is obviously not talking about ordinary conversation.
 It's talking about the ideal type of conversation among meditators, the
 very opposite of idle chatter:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abandoning idle chatter, one abstains from idle chatter.
 One speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with
 the goal, the Dhamma, & the Vinaya.
 One speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed,
 connected with the goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several passages in the Canon list ten ideal topics for such conversation:
 modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence,
 virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge & vision
 of release.
 The purpose of this study guide is to illustrate each of these topics with
 passages from the Canon, and to provide meditators with the incentive to
 integrate conversation of this sort into their practice.
 There is some overlap between the topics listed here and those listed in
 two other study guides: Recognizing the Dhamma and The Ten Perfections.
 Thus some redundancy has been inevitable, but wherever possible I have
 also included material unavailable in those two guides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first passage included here, in addition to listing the ten ideal topics,
 also lists topics that monks and serious meditators should avoid, ranging
 from politics and food to theories about the creation of the world.
 The Commentary qualifies this list, saying that if one discusses these
 topics in a way connected with Dhamma — for example, pointing out the ephemeral
 nature of political power so as to engender a feeling of dispassion for
 it — then that would count as right speech, and an aid to the liberation
 of the mind.

 I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi
 at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery.
 Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning
 from their alms round, had gathered at the meeting hall and were engaged
 in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation: conversation about kings,
 robbers, & ministers of state; armies, alarms, & battles; food & drink;
 clothing, furniture, garlands, & scents; relatives; vehicles; villages,
 towns, cities, the countryside; women & heroes; the gossip of the street
 & the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the
 world & of the sea; talk of whether things exist or not.

Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon,
 went to the meeting hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready.

 have you been interrupted?"

 modest, doesn't want it to be known that 'He is modest.' Being content,
 he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is content.' Being reclusive, he
 doesn't want it to be known that 'He is reclusive.' His persistence being
 aroused, he doesn't want it to be known that 'His persistence is aroused.'
 His mindfulness being established, he doesn't want it to be known that
 'His mindfulness is established.' His mind being centered, he doesn't want
 it to be known that 'His mind is centered.' Being endowed with discernment,
 he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is endowed with discernment.' Enjoying
 non-complication, he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is enjoying non-compl

 Live, good sir! Life is better.
 Alive, you can do acts of merit.
 Your living the holy life, performing the fire sacrifice, will heap up

 What use is exertion to you? Hard to follow — the path of exertion — hard

 And to that Mara, speaking thus, the Blessed One said this: "Kinsman of

 As he remains thus focused on the body in & of itself, a fever based on

 He should then direct his mind to any inspiring theme [Comm: such as recollecti

 As his mind is directed to any inspiring theme, delight arises within him.
 In one who feels delight, rapture arises.
 In one whose mind is enraptured, the body grows serene.
 His body serene, he feels pleasure.
 As he feels pleasure, his mind grows concentrated.
 He reflects, 'I have attained the aim to which my mind was directed.

 Don't misrepresent the Blessed One, for it's not right to misrepresent
 the Blessed One, and the Blessed One wouldn't say that.
 It's impossible, there is no way that — when "I am" is gone, and "I am
 this" is not assumed — the arrow of uncertainty & perplexity would keep
 overpowering the mind.
 That possibility doesn't exist, for this is the escape from the arrow of
 uncertainty & perplexity: the uprooting of the conceit, "I am".'

 On one occasion Ven.
 Godatta was living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango Grove.
 Then Citta the householder went to him and, on arrival, having bowed down
 to him, sat to one side.
 As he was sitting there, Ven.
 Godatta said to him, "Householder, the immeasurable awareness-release,
 the nothingness awareness-release, the emptiness awareness-release, the
 themeless awareness-release: Are these phenomena different in meaning and
 different in name, or are they one in meaning and different only in name?"

"And what is the line of reasoning by which they are different in meaning
 and different in name? There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the
 first direction [the east] with an awareness imbued with good will, likewise
 the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.
 Thus above, below, & all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps
 pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good
 will — abundant, expansive, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill
 will.
 He keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion

 Thus above, below, & all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps

 Then, on the attainment of arahantship, this thought occurred to Ven.
 Sona: "What if I were to go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, to declare
 gnosis in his presence?" So he then went to the Blessed One and, on arrival,
 having bowed down to him, sat to one side.
 As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "When a monk is an
 arahant, with his fermentations ended, one who has reached fulfillment,
 done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed

Meditation Instructions in the Thai Theravada Tradition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meditation is a centrepiece of Buddhist practice.
 It is a method to develop the mind.
 The emphasis is on concentration, focus, clarity, calmness, and insight.
 There are different techniques; most of them are easy to learn and very
 useful in daily life.
 The following is an introduction to samatha-vipassana meditation in the
 Thai Theravada tradition (adapted with minor amendments from the Bung Wai
 Forest Monastery, Thailand).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Introduction to Insight Meditation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of Insight Meditation is not to create a system of beliefs,
 but rather to give guidance on how to see clearly into the nature of the
 mind.
 In this way one gains first-hand understanding of the way things are, without
 reliance on opinions or theories - a direct experience, which has its own
 vitality.
 It also gives rise to the sense of deep calm that comes from knowing something
 for oneself beyond any doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term Insight Meditation (samatha-vipassana) refers to practices for
 the mind that develop calm (samatha) through sustained attention and insight
 (vipassana) through reflection.
 A fundamental technique for sustaining attention is focusing awareness
 on the body; traditionally, this is practised while sitting or walking.
 This guide begins with some advice on this technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reflection occurs quite naturally afterwards, when one is 'comfortable'
 within the context of the meditation exercise.
 There will be a sense of ease and interest, and one begins to look around
 and become acquainted with the mind that is meditating.
 This 'looking around' is called contemplation, a personal and direct seeing
 that can only be suggested by any technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sustaining Attention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Focusing the mind on the body can be readily accomplished while sitting.
 You need to find a time and a place which affords you calm and freedom
 from disturbance.
 A quite room with not much in it to distract the mind is ideal.
 Timing is also important.
 It is not especially productive to meditate when you have something else
 to do or when you're pressed for time.
 It's better to set aside a period - say in the early morning or in the
 evening after work-when you can really give your full attention to the
 practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Begin with fifteen minutes or so.
 Practice sincerely with the limitations of time and available energy, and
 avoid becoming mechanical about the routine.
 Meditation practice, supported by genuine willingness to investigate and
 make peace with oneself, will develop naturally in terms of duration and
 skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Awareness of the Body
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of calm is aided by stability, and by a steady but peaceful
 effort.
 If you can't feel settled, there is no peacefulness; if there is no effort,
 you tend to daydream.
 One of the most effective postures for the cultivation of the proper balance
 of stillness and energy is the sitting posture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use a posture that will keep your back straight without strain.
 A simple upright chair may be helpful, or you may be able to use the lotus
 posture.
 These postures may look awkward at first, but in time they can provide
 a unique balance of gentle firmness that gladdens the mind without tiring
 the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the chin is tilted very slightly down this will help but do not allow
 the head to loll forward as this encourages drowsiness.
 Place the hands on your lap, palm upwards, one gently resting on the other
 with the thumb-tips touching.
 Take your time and get the right balance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, collect your attention, and begin to move it slowly down your body.
 Notice the sensations in each part of your body.
 Relax any tensions, particularly in the face, neck and hands.
 Allow the eyelids to close or half close.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Investigate how you are feeling.
 Are you expectant or tense? Then relax your attention a little.
 With this, the mind will probably calm down and you may find some thoughts
 drifting in - reflections, daydreams, memories, or doubts about whether
 you are doing it right! Instead of following or contending with these thought
 patterns, bring more attention to the body, which is a useful anchor for
 a wandering mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cultivate a spirit of inquiry in your meditation attitude.
 Take your time.
 Move your attention, for example, systematically from the crown of the
 head down over the whole body.
 Notice the different sensations - such as warmth, pulsing, numbness, and
 sensitivity - in the joints of each finger, the moisture of the palms,
 and the pulse in the wrist.
 Even areas that may have no particular sensation, such as the forearms
 or the earlobes can be "swept over" in an attentive way.
 Notice how even the lack of sensation is something the mind can be aware
 of.
 This constant and sustained investigation is called mindfulness (sati)
 and is one of the primary tools of Insight Meditation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness of breathing - anapanasati
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of "body sweeping", or after a preliminary period of this practice,
 mindfulness can be developed through attention on the breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, follow the sensation of your ordinary breath as it flows in through
 the nostrils and fills the chest and abdomen.
 Then try maintaining your attention at one point, either at the diaphragm
 or - a more refined location - at the nostrils.
 Breath has a tranquilising quality, steady and relaxing if you don't force
 it; this is helped by an upright posture.
 Your mind may wander, but keep patiently returning to the breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not necessary to develop concentration to the point of excluding everythin
g else except the breath.
 Rather than to create a trance, the purpose here is to allow you to notice
 the workings of the mind, and to bring a measure of peaceful clarity into
 it.
 The entire process - gathering your attention, noticing the breath, noticing
 that the mind has wandered, and re-establishing your attention - develops
 mindfulness, patience and insightful understanding.
 So don't be put off by apparent "failure" - simply begin again.
 Continuing in this way allows the mind eventually to calm down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you get very restless or agitated, just relax.
 Practice being at peace with yourself, listening to - without necessarily
 believing in - the voices of the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you feel drowsy, then put more care and attention into your body and
 posture.
 Refining your attention or pursuing tranquillity at such times will only
 make matters worse!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Walking and Standing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many meditation exercises, such as the above "mindfulness of breathing",
 are practised while sitting.
 However, walking is commonly alternated with sitting as a form of meditation.
 Apart from giving you different things to notice, it is a skilful way to
 energise the practice if the calming effect of sitting is making you dull.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have access to some open land, measure off about 25-30 paces' length
 of level ground (r a clearly defined pathway between two trees), as your
 meditation path.
 Stand at one end of the path, and compose your mind on the sensations of
 the body.
 First, let the attention rest on the feeling of the body standing upright,
 with the arms hanging naturally and the hands lightly clasped in front
 or behind.
 Allow the eyes to gaze at a point about three meters in front of you at
 ground level, thus avoiding visual distraction.
 Now, walk gently, at a deliberate but 'normal' pace, to the end of the
 path.
 Stop.
 Focus on the body standing for the period of a couple of breaths.
 Turn, and walk back again.
 While walking, be aware of the general flow of physical sensations, or
 more closely direct your attention to the feet.
 The exercise for the mind is to keep bringing its attention back to the
 sensation of the feet touching the ground, the spaces between each step,
 and the feelings of stopping and starting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the mind will wander.
 So it is important to cultivate patience, and the resolve to begin again.
 Adjust the pace to suit your state of mind - vigorous when drowsy or trapped
 in obsessive thought, firm but gentle when restless and impatient.
 At the end of the path, stop; breathe in and out; 'let go' of any restlessness,
 worry, calm, bliss, memories or opinions about yourself.
 The 'inner chatter' may stop momentarily, or fade out.
 Begin again.
 In this way you continually refresh the mind, and allow it to settle at
 its own rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In more confined spaces, alter the length of the path to suit what is available.
 Alternatively, you can circumambulate a room, pausing after each circumambulati
on for a few moments of standing.
 This period of standing can be extended to several minutes, using 'body
 sweeping'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Walking brings energy and fluidity into the practice, so keep your pace
 steady and just let changing conditions pass through the mind.
 Rather than expecting the mind to be as still as it might be while sitting,
 contemplate the flow of phenomena.
 It is remarkable how many times we can become engrossed in a train of thought
 - arriving at the end of the path and 'coming to' with a start! - but it
 is natural for our untrained minds to become absorbed in thoughts and moods.
 So instead of giving in to impatience, learn how to let go, and begin again.
 A sense of ease and calm may then arise, allowing the mind to become open
 and clear in a natural, unforced way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lying Down
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reclining at the end of a day, spend a few minutes meditating while lying
 on one side.
 Keep the body quite straight and bend one arm up so that the hand acts
 as a support for the head.
 Sweep through the body, resting its stresses; or collect your attention
 on the breath, consciously putting aside memories of the day just past
 and expectations of tomorrow.
 In a few minutes, with your mind clear, you'll be able to rest well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cultivating The Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cultivating goodwill (metta) gives another dimension to the practice of
 Insight.
 Meditation naturally teaches patience and tolerance or at least it shows
 the importance of these qualities.
 So you may well wish to develop a more friendly and caring attitude towards
 yourself and other people.
 In meditation, you can cultivate goodwill very realistically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Focus attention on the breath, which you will now be using as the means
 of spreading kindness and goodwill.
 Begin with yourself, with your body.
 Visualise the breath as a light, or see your awareness as being a warm
 ray and gradually sweep it over your body.
 Lightly focus your attention on the centre of the chest, around the heart
 region.
 As you breath in, direct patient kindness towards yourself, perhaps with
 the thought, "May I be well", or "Peace".
 As you breathe out, let the mood of that thought, or the awareness of light,
 spread outwards from the heart, through the body, through the mind and
 beyond yourself.
 "May others be well".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are experiencing negative states of mind, breathe in the qualities
 of tolerance and forgiveness.
 Visualizing the breath as having a healing colour may be helpful.
 On the out-breath, let go of any stress, worry or negativity, and extend
 the sense of release through the body, the mind, and beyond, as before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This practice can form all or part of a period of meditation - you have
 to judge for yourself what is appropriate.
 The calming effect of meditating with a kind attitude is good for beginning
 a sitting but there will no doubt be times to use this approach for long
 periods, to go deeply into the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Always begin with what you are aware of, even if it seems trivial or confused.
 Let your mind rest calmly on that-whether it's boredom, an aching knee,
 or the frustration of not feeling particularly kindly.
 Allow these to be; practice being at peace with them.
 Recognise and gently put aside any tendencies towards laziness, doubt or
 guilt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peacefulness can develop into a very nourishing kindness towards yourself,
 if you first of all accept the presence of what you dislike.
 Keep the attention steady, and open the heart to whatever you experience.
 This does not imply the approval of negative states, but allows them a
 space wherein they can come and go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generating goodwill toward the world beyond yourself follows much the same
 pattern.
 A simple way to spread kindness is to work in stages.
 Start with yourself, joining the sense of loving acceptance to the movement
 of the breath.
 "May I be well." Then, reflect on people you love and respect, and wish
 them well, one by one.
 Move on to friendly acquaintances, then to those towards whom you feel
 indifferent.
 "May they be well." Finally, bring to mind those people you fear or dislike,
 and continue to send out wishes of goodwill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This meditation can expand, in a movement of compassion, to include all
 people in the world, in their many circumstances.
 And remember, you don't have to feel that you love everyone in order to
 wish them well!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kindness and compassion originate from the same source of good will, and
 they broaden the mind beyond the purely personal perspective.
 If you're not always trying to make things go the way you want them to:
 if you're more accepting and receptive to yourself and others as they are,
 compassion arises by itself.
 Compassion is the natural sensitivity of the heart.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When embraced, the rod of violence breeds danger & fear: Look at people
 quarreling.
 I will tell of how I experienced dismay.
 Seeing people floundering like fish in small puddles, competing with one
 another — as I saw this, fear came into me.
 The world was entirely without substance.
 All the directions were knocked out of line.
 Wanting a haven for myself, I saw nothing that wasn't laid claim to.
 Seeing nothing in the end but competition, I felt discontent.
 And then I saw an arrow here, so very hard to see, embedded in the heart.
 Overcome by this arrow you run in all directions.
 But simply on pulling it out you don't run, you don't sink...
 Whatever things are tied down in the world, you shouldn't be set on them.
 Having totally penetrated sensual pleasures, sensual passions, you should
 train for your own Unbinding.

\begin_layout Standard
In this short autobiographical passage, the Buddha describes his sense of
 dismay at the violence in the world, together with his important discovery:
 that the only escape from violence is to remove the causes of violence
 from one's own heart.
 To remove these causes, one must first refrain from violence on the external
 level so as to create the proper karmic context — more peaceful and honest
 — for extracting the causes of violence on the internal level.
 The following passages from the Pali canon illustrate these two levels
 of the practice, starting first with a few considerations on the principle
 of kamma (karma).
 For a more complete background on kamma, see the study guide on that topic.
 The concluding passages in this collection focus on the concept of "papañca,"
 or complication, as the internal cause of conflict.
 For a discussion of this concept, see the Introduction to MN 18.

All tremble at the rod, all are fearful of death.
 Drawing the parallel to yourself, neither kill nor get others to kill.
 All tremble at the rod, all hold their life dear.
 Drawing the parallel to yourself, neither kill nor get others to kill.
 Whoever takes a rod to harm living beings desiring ease, when he himself
 is looking for ease, will meet with no ease after death.
 Whoever doesn't take a rod to harm living beings desiring ease, when he
 himself is looking for ease, will meet with ease after death.
 Speak harshly to no one, or the words will be thrown right back at you.
 Contentious talk is painful, for you get struck by rods in return.

 in you there's found no contention.

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika
 Mango Grove.
 Then Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival,
 having bowed down to him, sat to one side.
 As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "The brahmans of the
 Western lands, lord — those who carry water pots, wear garlands of water
 plants, purify with water, & worship fire — can take [the spirit of] a
 dead person, lift it out, instruct it, & send it to heaven.
 But the Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so
 that all the world, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappears
 in a good destination, the heavenly world."

"Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter.
 Answer as you see fit.
 What do you think: There is the case where a man is one who takes life,
 steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech,
 harsh speech, & idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &
 holds to wrong views.
 Then a great crowd of people, gathering & congregating, would pray, praise,
 & circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,]
 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a
 good destination, the heavenly world!' What do you think: would that man

 case where a certain person takes life, is brutal, bloody-handed, devoted
 to killing & slaying, showing no mercy to living beings.
 He takes what is not given.
 He takes, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness
 that belong to others and have not been given by them.
 He engages in sensual misconduct.
 He gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers,
 their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their
 Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those
 crowned with flowers by another man.

 where a certain person engages in false speech.
 When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering
 of his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty [i.e., a royal court proceeding],
 if he is asked as a witness, 'Come & tell, good man, what you know': If
 he doesn't know, he says, 'I know.' If he does know, he says, 'I don't know.'
 If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I have seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I haven't
 seen.' Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake, for the sake of
 another, or for the sake of a certain reward.
 He engages in divisive speech.
 What he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from
 these people here.
 What he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from

 Thus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between
 those who have broken apart, he loves factionalism, delights in factionalism,
 enjoys factionalism, speaks things that create factionalism.
 He engages in abusive speech.
 He speaks words that are harsh, cutting, bitter to others, abusive of others,
 provoking anger and destroying concentration.
 He engages in idle chatter.
 He speaks out of season, speaks what isn't factual, what isn't in accordance
 with the goal, the Dhamma, & the Vinaya, words that are not worth treasuring.

1.The devas & asuras were two groups of deities who fought for control of
 heaven (like the gods & titans in Greek mythology).
 The devas eventually won.
 The asuras, known for their fierce anger, later became classed as angry
 demons and, in some Buddhist cosmologies, are regarded as a class of being
 lower than human.2.Vasava — "Powerful" — is one of Sakka's epithets.

These seven things — pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim
 — come to a man or woman who is angry.
 Which seven?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is the case where an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person
 be ugly!' Why is that? An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's good looks.
 Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger
 — then even though that he may be well-bathed, well-anointed, dressed in
 white clothes, his hair & beard neatly trimmed, he is ugly nevertheless,
 all because he is overcome with anger.
 This is the first thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's
 aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person sleep badly!'
 Why is that? An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's restful sleep.
 Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger
 — then even though he sleeps on a bed spread with a white blanket, spread
 with a woolen coverlet, spread with a flower-embroidered bedspread, covered
 with a rug of deerskins, with a canopy overhead, or on a sofa with red
 cushions at either end, he sleeps badly nevertheless, all because he is
 overcome with anger.
 This is the second thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's
 aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not profit!'
 Why is that? An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's profits.
 Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger
 — then even when he suffers a loss, he thinks, 'I've gained a profit';
 and even when he gains a profit, he thinks, 'I've suffered a loss.' When
 he has grabbed hold of these ideas that work in mutual opposition [to the
 truth], they lead to his long-term suffering & loss, all because he is
 overcome with anger.
 This is the third thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's
 aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not have any
 wealth!' Why is that? An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's wealth.
 Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger
 — then whatever his wealth, earned through his efforts & enterprise, amassed
 through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his
 brow — righteous wealth righteously gained — the king orders it sent to
 the royal treasury [in payment of fines levied for his behavior] all because
 he is overcome with anger.
 This is the fourth thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's
 aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not have any
 reputation!' Why is that? An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's reputation.
 Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger
 — whatever reputation he has gained from being heedful, it falls away,
 all because he is overcome with anger.
 This is the fifth thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's
 aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not have any
 friends!' Why is that? An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's having friends.
 Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger
 — his friends, companions, & relatives will avoid him from afar, all because
 he is overcome with anger.
 This is the sixth thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's
 aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person, on the break-up
 of the body, after death, reappear in the plane of deprivation, the bad
 bourn, the lower realms, in hell!' Why is that? An enemy is not pleased
 with an enemy's going to heaven.
 Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger
 — he engages in misconduct with the body, misconduct with speech, misconduct
 with the mind.
 Having engaged in misconduct with the body, misconduct with speech, misconduct
 with the mind, then — on the break-up of the body, after death — he reappears
 in the plane of deprivation, the bad bourn, the lower realms, in hell,
 all because he was overcome with anger.
 This is the seventh thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's
 aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.

An angry person is ugly & sleeps poorly.
 Gaining a profit, he turns it into a loss, having done damage with word
 & deed.
 A person overwhelmed with anger destroys his wealth.
 Maddened with anger, he destroys his status.
 Relatives, friends, & colleagues avoid him.
 Anger brings loss.
 Anger inflames the mind.
 He doesn't realize that his danger is born from within.
 An angry person doesn't know his own benefit.
 An angry person doesn't see the Dhamma.
 A man conquered by anger is in a mass of darkness.
 He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good, but later, when his
 anger is gone, he suffers as if burned with fire.
 He is spoiled, blotted out, like fire enveloped in smoke.
 When anger spreads, when a man becomes angry, he has no shame, no fear
 of evil, is not respectful in speech.
 For a person overcome with anger, nothing gives light.
 I'll list the deeds that bring remorse, that are far from the teachings.
 Listen! An angry person kills his father, kills his mother, kills Brahmans
 & people run-of-the-mill.
 It's because of a mother's devotion that one sees the world, yet an angry
 run-of-the-mill person can kill this giver of life.
 Like oneself, all beings hold themselves most dear, yet an angry person,
 deranged, can kill himself in many ways: with a sword, taking poison, hanging
 himself by a rope in a mountain glen.
 Doing these deeds that kill beings and do violence to himself, the angry
 person doesn't realize that he's ruined.
 This snare of Mara, in the form of anger, dwelling in the cave of the heart:
 cut it out with self-control, discernment, persistence, right view.
 The wise man would cut out each & every form of unskillfulness.
 Train yourselves: 'May we not be blotted out.' Free from anger & untroubled,
 free from greed, without longing, tamed, your anger abandoned, free from
 fermentation, you will be unbound.

Now as for a person who is impure in his bodily behavior but pure in his

 who makes use of things that are thrown away sees a rag in the road: Taking
 hold of it with his left foot and spreading it out with his right, he would
 tear off the sound part and go off with it.
 In the same way, when the individual is impure in his bodily behavior but
 pure in his verbal behavior, one should at that time pay no attention to
 the impurity of his bodily behavior, and instead pay attention to the purity
 of his verbal behavior.
 Thus the hatred for him should be subdued.

 bodily behavior, how should one subdue hatred for him? Just as when there

 He would jump into the pool, part the slime & water plants with both hands,
 and then, cupping his hands, drink the water and go on his way.
 In the same way, when the individual is impure in his verbal behavior but

 The thought would occur to him, 'Here is this little puddle in a cow's
 footprint.
 If I tried to drink the water using my hand or cup, I would disturb it,
 stir it up, & make it unfit to drink.
 What if I were to get down on all fours and slurp it up like a cow, and
 then go on my way?' So he would get down on all fours, slurp up the water
 like a cow, and then go on his way.
 In the same way, when an individual is impure in his bodily behavior &

 from the last, unable to get the food he needs, unable to get the medicine
 he needs, unable to get a suitable assistant, unable to get anyone to take
 him to human habitation.
 Now suppose another person were to see him coming along the road.
 He would do what he could out of compassion, pity, & sympathy for the man,
 thinking, 'O that this man should get the food he needs, the medicine he
 needs, a suitable assistant, someone to take him to human habitation.
 Why is that? So that he won't fall into ruin right here.' In the same way,
 when a person is impure in his bodily behavior & verbal behavior, and who

 one can out of compassion, pity, & sympathy for him, thinking, 'O that
 this man should abandon wrong bodily conduct and develop right bodily conduct,
 abandon wrong verbal conduct and develop right verbal conduct, abandon
 wrong mental conduct and develop right mental conduct.
 Why is that? So that, on the break-up of the body, after death, he won't
 fall into the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms,
 purgatory.' Thus the hatred for him should be subdued.

 of many kinds — and a person comes along, burning with heat, covered with
 sweat, exhausted, trembling, & thirsty.
 Having plunged into the pool, having bathed & drunk & come back out, he
 would sit down or lie down right there in the shade of the trees.
 In the same way, when an individual is pure in his bodily behavior & verbal

\begin_layout Standard
1.Complication = papañca.
 As one writer has noted, the word papañca has had a wide variety of meanings
 in Indian thought, with only one constant: in Buddhist philosophical discourse
 it carries negative connotations, usually of falsification and distortion.
 The word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness, spreading,
 proliferating.
 The Pali Commentaries define papañca as covering three types of thought:
 craving, conceit, and views.
 They also note that it functions to slow the mind down in its escape from
 the cycle of rebirth, to create baneful distinctions and unnecessary issues.
 For these reasons, I have chosen to render the word as "complication,"
 although some of the following alternatives might be acceptable as well:
 self-reflexive thinking, reification, proliferation, exaggeration, elaboration,
 distortion.
 The word offers some interesting parallels to the postmodern notion of
 logocentric thinking, but it's important to note that the Buddha's program
 of deconstructing this process differs sharply from that of postmodern
 thought.

\begin_layout Standard
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Sakyans
 near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park.
 Then in the early morning, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl
 & outer robe, he went into Kapilavatthu for alms.
 Having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu, after the meal, returning from his
 alms round, he went to the Great Wood for the day's abiding.
 Plunging into the Great Wood, he sat down at the root of a bilva sapling
 for the day's abiding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dandapani ("Stick-in-hand") the Sakyan, out roaming & rambling for exercise,
 also went to the Great Wood.
 Plunging into the Great Wood, he went to where the Blessed One was under
 the bilva sapling.
 On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with him.
 After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side.
 As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, "What is the contemplativ
e's doctrine? What does he proclaim?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The sort of doctrine, friend, where one does not keep quarreling with anyone
 in the cosmos with its deities, Maras, & Brahmas, with its contemplatives
 & priests, its royalty & commonfolk; the sort [of doctrine] where perceptions
 no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensual pleasures,
 free from perplexity, his uncertainty cut away, devoid of craving for becoming
 & non-.
 Such is my doctrine, such is what I proclaim."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this was said, Dandapani the Sakyan — shaking his head, wagging his
 tongue, raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was wrinkled in three
 furrows — left, leaning on his stick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from his seclusion and went
 to the Banyan Park.
 On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready.
 As he was sitting there, he [told the monks what had happened].
 When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, "Lord, what
 sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in
 the cosmos with its deities, Maras, & Brahmas, with its contemplatives
 & priests, its royalty & commonfolk; where perceptions no longer obsess
 the brahman who remains dissociated from sensual pleasures, free from perplexit
y, his uncertainty cut away, devoid of craving for becoming & non-?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If, monk, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories
 of complication assail a person, there is nothing there to relish, welcome,
 or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the obsessions of passion,
 the obsessions of resistance, the obsessions of views, the obsessions of
 uncertainty, the obsessions of conceit, the obsessions of passion for becoming,
 & the obsessions of ignorance.
 That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels,
 disputes, accusations, divisive tale-bearing, & false speech.
 That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder." That
 is what the Blessed One said.
 Having said it, the One Well-gone got up from his seat and went into his
 dwelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, this thought occurred to
 the monks: "This brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he went
 into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning — i.e., 'If, with
 regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of complication
 assail a person, there is nothing to relish...
 that is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder': now
 who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement?"
 Then the thought occurred to them, "Ven.
 Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his knowledgeable
 companions in the holy life.
 He is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief
 statement.

So the monks went to Ven.
 Maha Kaccana and, on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him.

Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.As other passages in this poem indicate (see note 5, below), the goal is
 not measured in terms of knowledge, but as this passage points out, knowledge
 is a necessary part of the path to the goal.2.According to Nd.I, this passage
 is describing the four formless jhanas, but as the first three of the formless
 jhanas involve perception (of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and
 nothingness), only the fourth of the formless jhanas — the dimension of
 neither perception nor non-perception — would fit this description.3.Complication
-classifications (papañca-sankha): The mind's tendency to read distinctions
 and differentiations even into the simplest experience of the present,
 thus giving rise to views that can issue in conflict.
 As Sn 4.14 points out, the root of these classifications is the perception,
 "I am the thinker." For further discussion of this point, see note 1 to
 that discourse and the introduction to MN 18.4."Spirit" is the usual rendering
 of the Pali word, yakkha.
 According to Nd.I, however, in this context the word yakkha means person,
 individual, human being, or living being.5.In other words, the sage knows
 that both groups in the previous stanza fall back on their knowledge as
 a measure of the goal, without comprehending the dependency still latent
 in their knowledge.
 The sages in the first group are mistaking the experience of neither perception
 nor non-perception as the goal, and so they are still dependent on that
 state of concentration.
 The sages in the second group, by the fact that they claim to be skilled,
 show that there is still a latent conceit in their Awakening-like experience,
 and thus it is not totally independent of clinging.
 (For more on this point, see MN 102, quoted in The Mind Like Fire Unbound,
 pp.
 81-82.) Both groups still maintain the concept of a "spirit" that is purified
 in the realization of purity.
 Once these dependencies are comprehended, one gains release from disputes
 and from states of becoming and not-becoming.
 It is in this way that knowledge is a means to the goal, but the goal itself
 is not measured or defined in terms of knowledge.

"I ask the kinsman of the Sun, the great seer, about seclusion & the state
 of peace.
 Seeing in what way is a monk unbound, clinging to nothing in the world?"
 "He should put an entire stop to the root of complication-classifications:
 'I am the thinker.'1 He should train, always mindful, to subdue any craving
 inside him.
 Whatever truth he may know, within or without, he shouldn't get entrenched
 in connection with it, for that isn't called Unbinding by the good.
 He shouldn't, because of it, think himself better, lower, or equal.
 Touched by contact in various ways, he shouldn't keep conjuring self.
 Stilled right within, a monk shouldn't seek peace from another, from anything
 else.
 For one stilled right within, there's nothing embraced, so how rejected?
 Nothing that's self, so from whence would there be against-self?2 As in
 the middle of the sea it is still, with no waves upwelling, so the monk
 — unperturbed, still — should not swell himself anywhere."

Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.On complication-classifications and their role in leading to conflict,
 see Sn 4.11 and the introduction to MN 18.
 The perception, "I am the thinker" lies at the root of these classifications
 in that it reads into the immediate present a set of distinctions — I/not-I;
 being/not-being; thinker/thought; identity/non-identity — that then can
 proliferate into mental and physical conflict.
 The conceit inherent in this perception thus forms a fetter on the mind.
 To become unbound, one must learn to examine these distinctions — which
 we all take for granted — to see that they are simply assumptions that
 are not inherent in experience, and that we would be better off to be able
 to drop them.2."Embraced/rejected, self/against-self" — a pun on the pair
 of Pali words, atta/nirattam.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shortly after her ordination, the Buddha's step-mother, Mahapajapati Gotami,
 asked him for a short Dhamma-instruction that would guide her in her solitary
 practice.
 He responded with eight principles for recognizing what qualifies as Dhamma
 and Vinaya, and what does not.
 The commentary tells us that after her instruction, Mahapajapati Gotami
 in no long time became an arahant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eight principles have been widely cited ever since.
 One Thai writer has called them the "constitution of Buddhism" as they
 form the standards against which the validity of any interpretation of
 the Dhamma or Vinaya must be judged.
 Perhaps the most important point that these principles make is that any
 teaching has to be judged by the results that come when putting it into
 practice.
 They are an excellent illustration of the teachings given in the well-known
 Kalama Sutta (AN 3.65), as well as in the teachings that the Buddha gave
 to his son, Rahula (MN 61).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Canon illustrates these principles not only with abstract discussions
 but also with stories, and the stories are often more memorable than the
 discussions.
 Thus this study guide differs from its companions in that it is predominantly
 composed of stories.
 Bear in mind as you read the stories that they are often framed in somewhat
 extreme terms to drive their points home.
 Sister Subha [§1.4], Kali [§2.10], Prince Dighavu [§3.3], and the monk whose
 limbs are being removed by a saw [§2.10] would not be as memorable if their
 stories were framed in more realistic terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also bear in mind that there is some overlap among the principles, and that
 a passage may illustrate more than one at a time.
 Thus, for instance, the story of Ven.
 Isidatta [§2.11] analyzes the fetter of self-identity views, at the same
 time illustrating the principles of modesty and non-entanglement.
 The most extensive overlap is between the principle of dispassion and that
 of not being fettered, as passion in its various forms covers three of
 the ten fetters that bind a person to the round of rebirth.
 Thus the section on dispassion contains passages dealing with how to overcome
 the three "passion fetters" — sensual passion, passion for the sense of
 form experienced in the jhanas of form, and passion for the sense of formlessne
ss experienced in the formless jhanas — whereas the section on being unfettered
 treats the remaining seven fetters.

The Eight Principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have heard that at on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vesali,
 in the Peaked Roof Hall in the Great Forest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Mahapajapati Gotami went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having
 bowed down to him, stood to one side.
 As she was standing there she said to him: "It would be good, lord, if
 the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that, having heard
 the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, secluded, heedful,
 ardent, & resolute."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Gotami, the qualities of which you may know, 'These qualities lead:

\begin_layout Standard
to passion, not to dispassion; to being fettered, not to being unfettered;
 to accumulating, not to shedding; to self-aggrandizement, not to modesty;
 to discontent, not to contentment; to entanglement, not to seclusion; to
 laziness, not to aroused persistence; to being burdensome, not to being
 unburdensome':

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Gaya, at
 Gaya Head, with 1,000 monks.
 There he addressed the monks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Monks, the All is aflame.
 What All is aflame? The eye is aflame.
 Forms are aflame.
 Consciousness at the eye is aflame.
 Contact at the eye is aflame.
 And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye —
 experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is
 aflame.
 Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion,
 the fire of delusion.
 Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging & death, with sorrows, lamentations,
 pains, distresses, & despairs.

 Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion,

 Aflame, I say, with birth, aging & death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the
 eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with consciousness at the eye,
 disenchanted with contact at the eye.
 And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye,
 experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that,
 too, he grows disenchanted.

 Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.
 Through dispassion, he is fully released.
 With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns
 that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.
 There is nothing further for this world.'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is what the Blessed One said.
 Gratified, the monks delighted at his words.
 And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the 1,000 monks,
 through no clinging (not being sustained), were fully released from fermentatio

 On hearing a sound with the ear...

 untiring, both day & night, I, with my own discernment dissecting it, saw.

 seen inside & out.

 detached, calmed was I.

\begin_layout Standard
As Subha the nun was going through Jivaka's delightful mango grove, a libertine
 (a goldsmith's son) blocked her path, so she said to him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'What wrong have I done you that you stand in my way? It's not proper, my
 friend, that a man should touch a woman gone forth.
 I respect the Master's message, the training pointed out by the one well-gone.
 I am pure, without blemish: Why do you stand in my way? You — your mind
 agitated, impassioned; I — unagitated, unimpassioned, with a mind entirely
 freed: Why do you stand in my way?' 'You are young & not bad-looking, what
 need do you have for going forth? Throw off your ochre robe — Come, let's
 delight in the flowering grove.
 A sweetness they exude everywhere, the towering trees with their pollen.
 The beginning of spring is a pleasant season — Come, let's delight in the
 flowering grove.
 The trees with their blossoming tips moan, as it were, in the breeze: What
 delight will you have if you plunge into the grove alone? Frequented by
 herds of wild beasts, disturbed by elephants rutting & aroused: you want
 to go unaccompanied into the great, lonely, frightening grove? Like a doll
 made of gold, you will go about, like a goddess in the gardens of heaven.
 With delicate, smooth Kasi fabrics, you will shine, O beauty without compare.
 I would gladly do your every bidding if we were to dwell in the glade.
 For there is no creature dearer to me than you, O nymph with the languid
 regard.
 If you do as I ask, happy, come live in my house.
 Dwelling in the calm of a palace, have women wait on you, wear delicate
 Kasi fabrics, adorn yourself with garlands & creams.
 I will make you many & varied ornaments of gold, jewels, & pearls.
 Climb onto a costly bed, scented with sandalwood carvings, with a well-washed
 coverlet, beautiful, spread with a woolen quilt, brand new.
 Like a blue lotus rising from the water where there dwell non-human beings,
 you will go to old age with your limbs unseen, if you stay as you are in
 the holy life.' 'What do you assume of any essence, here in this cemetery
 grower, filled with corpses, this body destined to break up? What do you
 see when you look at me, you who are out of your mind?' 'Your eyes are
 like those of a fawn, like those of a sprite in the mountains.
 Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the more.
 Like tips they are, of blue lotuses, in your golden face — spotless: Seeing
 your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the more.
 Even if you should go far away, I will think only of your pure, long-lashed
 gaze, for there is nothing dearer to me than your eyes, O nymph with the
 languid regard.' 'You want to stray from the road, you want the moon as
 a plaything, you want to jump over Mount Sineru, you who have designs on
 one born of the Buddha.
 For there is nothing anywhere at all in the cosmos with its gods, that
 would be an object of passion for me.
 I don't even know what that passion would be, for it's been killed, root
 & all, by the path.
 Like embers from a pit — scattered, like a bowl of poison — evaporated,
 I don't even see what that passion would be, for it's been killed, root
 & all, by the path.
 Try to seduce one who hasn't reflected on this, or who has not followed
 the Master's teaching.
 But try it with this one who knows and you suffer.
 For in the midst of praise & blame, pleasure & pain, my mindfulness stands
 firm.
 Knowing the unattractiveness of things compounded, my mind cleaves to nothing
 at all.
 I am a follower of the one well-gone, riding the vehicle of the eightfold
 way: My arrow removed, effluent-free, I delight, having gone to an empty
 dwelling.
 For I have seen well-painted puppets, hitched up with sticks & strings,
 made to dance in various ways.
 When the sticks & strings are removed, thrown away, scattered, shredded,
 smashed into pieces, not to be found, in what will the mind there make
 its home? This body of mine, which is just like that, when devoid of dhammas
 doesn't function.
 When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn't function, in what will the mind there
 make its home? Like a mural you've seen, painted on a wall, smeared with
 yellow orpiment, there your vision has been distorted, meaningless your
 human perception.
 Like an evaporated mirage, like a tree of gold in a dream, like a magic
 show in the midst of a crowd — you run blind after what is unreal.
 Resembling a ball of sealing wax, set in a hollow, with a bubble in the
 middle and bathed with tears, eye secretions are born there too: The parts
 of the eye are rolled all together in various ways.' Plucking out her lovely
 eye, with mind unattached she felt no regret.
 'Here, take this eye.
 It's yours.' Straightaway she gave it to him.
 Straightaway his passion faded right there, and he begged her forgiveness.
 'Be well, follower of the holy life.
 This sort of thing won't happen again.
 Harming a person like you is like embracing a blazing fire.
 It's as if I have seized a poisonous snake.
 So may you be well.
 Forgive me.' And released from there, the nun went to the excellent Buddha's
 presence.
 When she saw the mark of his excellent merit, her eye became as it was
 before.

Now at that time Ven.
 Anuruddha, going through the Kosalan countryside on his way to Savatthi,
 arrived in the evening at a certain village.
 And at that time a rest house had been set up by a woman in that village.
 So Ven.
 Anuruddha went to the woman and, on arrival, said to her, "If it is no
 inconvenience for you, sister, I will stay for one night in the rest house."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You are welcome to stay, venerable sir."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then other travelers went to that woman and, on arrival, said, "If it is
 no inconvenience for you, lady, we will stay for one night in the rest
 house."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 If he gives his permission, you may stay."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now it so happened that the woman had fallen in love with Ven.
 Anuruddha at first sight, so she went to him and said, "The master will
 not be comfortable, crowded with these people.
 It would be good if I were to prepare a bed inside for the master."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ven.
 Anuruddha consented by remaining silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the woman, having herself prepared a bed inside for Ven.
 Anuruddha, having put on her jewelry and scented herself with perfumes,
 went to him and said, "Master, you are beautiful, good-looking, and appealing.
 I, too, am beautiful, good-looking, & appealing.
 It would be good if I were to be your wife."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this was said, Ven.
 Anuruddha remained silent.
 So a second time...
 A third time she said to him, "Master, you are beautiful, good-looking,
 & appealing.
 I too am beautiful, good-looking, & appealing.
 Please take me together with all my wealth."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third time, Ven.
 Anuruddha remained silent.
 So the woman, having slipped off her upper cloak, paraded up & down in
 front of him, stood, sat down, & then lay down right in front of him.
 But Ven.
 Anuruddha, keeping control of his faculties, didn't as much as glance at
 her or say even a word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the thought occurred to her: "Isn't it amazing! Isn't it astounding!
 Many men send for me at a price of 100 or even 1,000 (a night), but this
 contemplative, even when I myself beg him, doesn't want to take me together
 with all of my wealth!" So, putting her upper cloak back on and bowing
 her head at his feet, she said to him: "Venerable sir, a transgression
 has overcome me in that I was so foolish, so muddle-headed, & so unskillful
 as to act in such a way.
 Please accept this confession of my transgression as such, so that I may
 restrain myself in the future."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes, sister, a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish,
 so muddle-headed, & so unskillful as to act in such a way.
 But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance
 with the Dhamma, we accept your confession.
 For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma & Discipline of the noble ones
 when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance with
 the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when the night had passed, the woman, with her own hand, served &
 satisfied Ven.
 Anuruddha with excellent staple and non-staple food.
 When Ven.
 Anuruddha had eaten & removed his hand from his bowl, she sat to one side.
 As she was sitting there, Ven.
 Anuruddha instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged her with a talk on Dhamma.
 Then the woman, having been instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged by
 Ven.
 Anuruddha with a talk on Dhamma, said to him, "Magnificent, venerable sir!
 Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to
 reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry
 a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same
 way has Ven.
 Anuruddha — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.
 I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community
 of monks.
 May the master remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from
 this day forward for life."

"[On attaining the fourth level of jhana] there remains only equanimity:

 Just as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice were to prepare
 a furnace, heat up a crucible, and, taking gold with a pair of tongs, place
 it in the crucible.
 He would blow on it periodically, sprinkle water on it periodically, examine
 it periodically, so that the gold would become refined, well-refined, thoroughl
y refined, flawless, free from dross, pliant, malleable & luminous.
 Then whatever sort of ornament he had in mind — whether a belt, an earring,
 a necklace, or a gold chain — it would serve his purpose.
 In the same way, there remains only equanimity: pure & bright, pliant,
 malleable & luminous.
 He [the meditator] discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure
 & bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space, I would
 develop the mind along those lines, and thus this equanimity of mine —
 thus supported, thus sustained — would last for a long time.

 Listen! An angry person kills his father, kills his mother, kills Brahmans

 It's because of a mother's devotion that one sees the world, yet an angry
 run-of-the-mill person can kill this giver of life.
 Like oneself, all beings hold themselves most dear, yet an angry person,
 deranged, can kill himself in many ways: with a sword, taking poison, hanging
 himself by a rope in a mountain glen.
 Doing these deeds that kill beings and do violence to himself, the angry
 person doesn't realize that he's ruined.
 This snare of Mara, in the form of anger, dwelling in the cave of the heart:
 cut it out with self-control, discernment, persistence, right view.
 The wise man would cut out each & every form of unskillfulness.

When dwelling on views as "supreme," a person makes them the utmost thing
 in the world, &, from that, calls all others inferior and so he's not free
 from disputes.
 When he sees his advantage in what's seen, heard, sensed, or in precepts
 & practices, seizing it there he sees all else as inferior.
 That, too, say the skilled, is a binding knot: that in dependence on which
 you regard another as inferior.
 So a monk shouldn't be dependent on what's seen, heard, or sensed, or on
 precepts & practices; nor should he conjure a view in the world in connection
 with knowledge or precepts & practices; shouldn't take himself to be "equal";
 shouldn't think himself inferior or superlative.

 in whom 'equal,' 'unequal' are not.
 Having abandoned home, living free from society, the sage in villages creates
 no intimacies.
 Rid of sensual passions, free from yearning, he wouldn't engage with people
 in quarrelsome debate.
 Those things aloof from which he should go about in the world: the great
 one wouldn't take them up & argue for them.
 As the prickly lotus is unsmeared by water & mud, so the sage, an exponent
 of peace, without greed, is unsmeared by sensuality & the world.
 An attainer-of-wisdom isn't measured made proud by views or by what is
 thought, for he isn't affected by them.
 He wouldn't be led by action, learning; doesn't reach a conclusion in any
 entrenchments.

 My mindfulness is established & unshaken.

Intoxicated with my complexion figure, beauty, & fame; haughty with youth,
 I despised other women.
 Adorning this body embellished to delude foolish men, I stood at the door
 to the brothel: a hunter with snare laid out.
 I showed off my ornaments, and revealed many a private part.
 I worked my manifold magic, laughing out loud at the crowd.
 Today, wrapped in a double cloak, my head shaven, having wandered for alms,
 I sit at the foot of a tree and attain the state of no-thought.
 All ties — human & divine — have been cut.
 Having cast off all effluents, cooled am I, unbound.

\begin_layout Standard
Once, monks, in Varanasi, Brahmadatta was the king of Kasi — rich, prosperous,
 with many possessions, many troops, many vehicles, many territories, with
 fully-stocked armories & granaries.
 Dighiti was the king of Kosala — poor, not very prosperous, with few possession
s, few troops, few vehicles, few territories, with poorly-stocked armories
 & granaries.
 So Brahmadatta the king of Kasi, raising a fourfold army, marched against
 Dighiti the king of Kosala.
 Dighiti the king of Kosala heard, "Brahmadatta the king of Kasi, they say,
 has raised a fourfold army and is marching against me." Then the thought
 occurred to him, "King Brahmadatta is rich, prosperous...
 with fully-stocked armories & granaries, whereas I am poor...
 with poorly-stocked armories & granaries.
 I am not competent to stand against even one attack by him.
 Why don't I slip out of the city beforehand?" So, taking his chief consort,
 he slipped out of the city beforehand.
 Then King Brahmadatta, conquering the troops, vehicles, lands, armories,
 & granaries of King Dighiti, lived in lordship over them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meanwhile, King Dighiti had set out for Varanasi together with his consort
 and, traveling by stages, arrived there.
 There he lived with her on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house,
 disguised as a wanderer.
 Not long afterwards, she became pregnant.
 She had a pregnancy wish of this sort: she wanted to see a fourfold army,
 armed & arrayed, standing on a parade ground at dawn, and to drink the
 water used for washing the swords.
 She said to King Dighiti, "Your majesty, I am pregnant, and I have a pregnancy
 wish of this sort: I want to see a fourfold army, armed & arrayed, standing
 on a parade ground at dawn, and to drink the water used for washing the
 swords." He said, "My queen, where is there for us — fallen on hard times
 — a fourfold army, armed & arrayed, standing on a parade ground, and water
 used for washing the swords?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If I don't get this, your majesty, I will die."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of
 King Dighiti.
 So King Dighiti went to him and, on arrival, said, "A lady friend of yours,
 old friend, is pregnant, and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort: she
 wants to see a fourfold army, armed & arrayed, standing on a parade ground
 at dawn, and to drink the water used for washing the swords."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"In that case, let me see her."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So King Dighiti's consort went to King Brahmadatta's brahman adviser.
 When he saw her coming from afar, he rose from his seat, arranged his robe
 over one shoulder and, with his hands raised in salutation to her, exclaimed
 three times, "Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb! Surely the
 king of Kosala has come to your womb! Don't be worried, my queen.
 You will get to see a fourfold army, armed & arrayed, standing on a parade
 ground at dawn, and to drink the water used for washing the swords."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he went to King Brahmadatta and, on arrival, said to him, "Your majesty,
 signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army, armed &
 arrayed, should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be
 washed."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people, "I say, then: Do as the brahman
 adviser says." Thus King Dighiti's chief consort got to see a fourfold army,
 armed & arrayed, standing on a parade ground at dawn, and got to drink
 the water used for washing the swords.
 Then, with the maturing of the fetus, she gave birth to a son, whom they
 named Dighavu (LongLife).
 Not long afterwards, Prince Dighavu reached the age of discretion.
 The thought occurred to King Dighiti, "This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has
 done us great harm.
 He has seized our troops, vehicles, lands, armories, & granaries.
 If he finds out about us, he will have all three of us killed.
 Why don't I send Prince Dighavu to live outside of the city?" So Prince
 Dighavu, having gone to live outside of the city, learned all the crafts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now at that time King Dighiti's barber had gone over to King Brahmadatta.
 He saw King Dighiti, together with his consort, living on the outskirts
 of Varanasi in a potter's house, disguised as a wanderer.
 On seeing them, he went to King Brahmadatta and, on arrival, said to him,
 "Your majesty, King Dighiti of Kosala, together with his consort, is living
 on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house, disguised as a wanderer."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people, "I say, then: go fetch King Dighiti
 together with his consort."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Responding, "As you say, your majesty," they went and fetched King Dighiti
 together with his consort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then King Brahmadatta ordered his people, "I say, then: having bound King
 Dighiti & his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly
 against their backs, and having shaved them bald, march them to a harsh-soundin

 south gate of the city and there, to the south of the city, cut them into
 four pieces and bury them in holes placed in the four directions."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Responding, "As you say, your majesty," the king's people bound King Dighiti
 & his consort with a stout rope, pinning their arms tightly against their
 backs, shaved them bald, and marched them to a harsh-sounding drum from
 street to street, crossroads to crossroads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu, "It's been a long time since
 I saw my mother & father.
 What if I were to go see them?" So he entered Varanasi and saw his mother
 & father bound with a stout rope, their arms pinned tightly against their
 backs, their heads shaven bald, being marched to a harsh-sounding drum
 from street to street, crossroads to crossroads.
 So he went to them.
 King Dighiti saw Prince Dighavu coming from afar, and on seeing him, said,
 "Don't, my dear Dighavu, be far-sighted.
 Don't be near-sighted.
 For vengeance is not settled through vengeance.
 Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this was said, the people said to him, "This King Dighiti has gone
 crazy.
 He's talking nonsense.
 Who is Dighavu? Why is he saying, 'Don't, my dear Dighavu, be far-sighted.
 Don't be near-sighted.
 For vengeance is not settled through vengeance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'm not crazy or talking nonsense.

Then the king's people, having marched King Dighiti together with his chief

s, evicted them out the south gate of the city and there, to the south of
 the city, cut them into four pieces, buried them in holes placed in the
 four directions, stationed guards, and left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Prince Dighavu, having entered Varanasi, brought out some liquor and
 got the guards to drink it.
 When they had fallen down drunk, he collected sticks, made a pyre, raised
 the bodies of his mother & father onto the pyre, set fire to it, and then
 circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now at that time, King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of
 his palace.
 He saw Prince Dighavu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands
 raised in salutation, and on seeing him, the thought occurred to him, "Doubtles
sly this person is a relative or blood-kinsman of King Dighiti.
 Ah, how unfortunate for me, for there is no one who will tell me what this
 means!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Prince Dighavu, having gone into the wilderness and having cried &
 wept as much as he needed to, dried his tears and entered Varanasi.
 Going to an elephant stable next to the king's palace, he said to the chief
 elephant trainer, "Teacher, I want to learn this craft."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"In that case, young man, you may learn it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, rising in the last watch of the night, Prince Dighavu sang in a sweet
 voice and played the lute in the elephant stable.
 King Brahmadatta, also rising in the last watch of the night, heard the
 sweet-voiced singing & lute-playing in the elephant stable.
 On hearing it, he asked his people, "I say: Who was that, rising in the
 last watch of the night, singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in
 the elephant stable?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I say then, my young man: sing and play the lute."

Responding, "As you say, your majesty," and seeking to win favor, Prince

\begin_layout Standard
Then King Brahmadatta said to him, "I say: You, my young man, are to stay

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As you say, your majesty," Prince Dighavu replied.
 Then he rose in the morning before King Brahmadatta, went to bed in the
 evening after him, did whatever the king ordered, always acting to please
 him, speaking politely to him.
 And it was not long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to
 him in a position of trust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu, "I say then, my young
 man: harness the chariot.
 I'm going hunting."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Responding, "As you say, your majesty," Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot
 and then said to King Brahmadatta, "Your chariot is harnessed, your majesty.
 Now is the time for you to do as you see fit."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot, and Prince Dighavu drove it.
 He drove it in such a way that the king's entourage went one way, and the
 chariot another.
 Then, after they had gone far, King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu,
 "I say then, my young man: unharness the chariot.
 I'm tired.
 I'm going to lie down."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Responding, "As you say, your majesty," Prince Dighavu unharnessed the chariot
 and sat down cross-legged on the ground.
 Then King Brahmadatta lay down, placing his head on Prince Dighavu's lap.
 As he was tired, he went to sleep right away.
 Then the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu: "This King Brahmadatta of
 Kasi has done us great harm.
 He has seized our troops, vehicles, lands, armories, & granaries.
 And it was because of him that my mother & father were killed.
 Now is my chance to wreak vengeance!" He drew his sword from his scabbard.
 But then he thought, "My father told me, as he was about to die, 'Don't,
 my dear Dighavu, be far-sighted.
 Don't be near-sighted.
 For vengeance is not settled through vengeance.
 Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance.' It would not be proper for
 me to transgress my father's words." So he put his sword back in its scabbard.

 in its scabbard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then King Brahmadatta suddenly got up — frightened, agitated, unnerved,
 alarmed.
 Prince Dighavu said to him, "Your majesty, why have you gotten up suddenly
 — frightened, agitated, unnerved, & alarmed?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I say, my young man: Just now as I was dreaming, Prince Dighavu — son of

 grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand, and drawing his
 sword from its scabbard with his right, said, "I, your majesty, am that
 very Prince Dighavu, son of Dighiti, king of Kasi.
 You have done us great harm.
 You have seized our troops, vehicles, lands, armories, & granaries.
 And it was because of you that my mother & father were killed.
 Now is my chance to wreak vengeance!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 "Grant me my life, my dear Dighavu! Grant me my life, my dear Dighavu!"

Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot, and Prince Dighavu drove it.
 He drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with

 convened and said to them, "I say, then.
 If you were to see Prince Dighavu, the son of Dighiti, the king of Kasi,

\end_layout

Different ministers said, "We would cut of his hands, your majesty" — "We

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the king said, "This, I say, is Prince Dighavu, the son of Dighiti,

 You are not allowed to do anything to him.
 It was by him that my life was granted to me, and it was by me that his
 life was granted to him."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu, "What your father said to
 you as he was about to die — 'Don't, my dear Dighavu, be far-sighted.
 Don't be near-sighted.
 For vengeance is not settled through vengeance.
 Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance' — in reference to what did
 he say that?"

\begin_layout Standard
"What my father said to me as he was about to die — 'Don't be far-sighted'

 And what he said to me as he was about to die — 'Don't be near-sighted'
 — 'Don't be quick to break with a friend' is what he was saying to me as
 he was about to die.
 And what he said to me as he was about to die — 'For vengeance is not settled
 through vengeance.
 Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance' — My mother & father were killed
 by your majesty.
 If I were to deprive your majesty of life, those who hope for your majesty's
 well-being would deprive me of life.
 And those who hope for my well-being would deprive them of life.
 And in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeance.
 But now I have been granted my life by your majesty, and your majesty has
 been granted your life by me.
 And in this way vengeance has been settled by non-vengeance.
 That is what my father was saying to me as he was about to die."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then King Brahmadatta said, "Isn't it amazing! Isn't it astounding! How

 Death is in your presence.
 Death has 1,000 parts of you.
 Only one part is your life.
 Live, good sir! Life is better.
 Alive, you can do acts of merit.
 Your living the holy life, performing the fire sacrifice, will heap up
 much merit.
 What use is exertion to you? Hard to follow — the path of exertion — hard
 to do, hard to sustain." Saying these verses, Mara stood in the Awakened
 One's presence.
 And to that Mara, speaking thus, the Blessed One said this: "Kinsman of
 the heedless, Evil One, come here for whatever purpose: I haven't, for
 merit, even the least bit of need.
 Those who have need of merit: those are the ones Mara's fit to address.
 In me are conviction austerity, persistence, discernment.
 Why, when I'm so resolute do you petition me to live? This wind could burn

 Why, when I'm resolute, shouldn't my blood dry away? As my blood dries
 up gall & phlegm dry up.
 As muscles waste away, the mind grows clearer; mindfulness, discernment,
 concentration stand more firm.
 Staying in this way, attaining the ultimate feeling,2 the mind has no interest

 See: a being's purity! Sensual passions are your first army.
 Your second is called Discontent.
 Your third is Hunger & Thirst.
 Your fourth is called Craving.
 Fifth is Sloth & Drowsiness.
 Sixth is called Terror.
 Your seventh is Uncertainty.
 Hypocrisy & Stubbornness, your eighth.
 Gains, Offerings, Fame, & Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise
 self & disparage others.
 That, Namuci, is your army, the Dark One's commando force.
 A coward can't defeat it, but one having defeated it gains bliss.
 Do I carry muñja grass?3 I spit on my life.
 Death in battle would be better for me than that I, defeated, survive.
 Sinking here, they don't appear, some priests & contemplatives.
 They don't know the path by which those with good practices go.
 Seeing the bannered force on all sides — the troops, Mara along with his
 mount — I go into battle.
 May they not budge me from my spot.
 That army of yours, that the world with its devas can't overcome, I will
 smash with discernment — as an unfired pot with a stone.
 Making my resolve mastered, mindfulness well-established, I will go about,
 from kingdom to kingdom, training many disciples.

At that time the monks of Alavi were having huts built from their own begging

 They were continually begging, continually hinting: 'Give a man, give labor,
 give an ox, give a wagon, give a machete, give an ax, give an adz, give
 a spade, give a chisel, give rushes, give reeds, give grass, give clay.'
 People, harassed with the begging, harassed with the hinting, on seeing

 The people, on seeing Ven.
 MahaKassapa, were apprehensive, alarmed, ran away, took another route,

 Then Ven.
 MahaKassapa, having gone for alms, after his meal, returning from his alms

 Alms food was easy to come by, it was easy to maintain oneself by gleanings

 But now Alavi is a bad place for alms.
 Alms food is hard to come by, it isn't easy to maintain oneself by gleanings

 Haven't I taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion and
 not for passion; for unfettering and not for fettering; for letting go
 and not for clinging? Yet here, while I have taught the Dhamma for dispassion,
 you set your heart on passion; while I have taught the Dhamma for unfettering,
 you set your heart on being fettered; while I have taught the Dhamma for
 letting go, you set your heart on clinging.
 Haven't I taught the Dhamma in various ways for the fading of passion,
 the sobering of pride, the subduing of thirst, the destruction of attachment,
 the severing of the round, the depletion of craving, dispassion, cessation,
 unbinding? Haven't I advocated abandoning sensual pleasures, understanding
 sensual perceptions, subduing sensual thirst, destroying sensual preoccupations

The Pali canon recognizes four levels of Awakening, the first of which is
 called stream entry.
 This gains its name from the fact that a person who has attained this level
 has entered the "stream" flowing inevitably to nibbana.
 He/she is guaranteed to achieve full Awakening within seven lifetimes at
 most, and in the interim will not be reborn in any of the lower realms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study guide on stream entry is divided into two parts.
 The first deals with the practices leading to stream entry; the second,
 with the experience of stream entry and its results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practices leading to stream entry are encapsulated in four factors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Association with people of integrity is a factor for stream-entry.
 Listening to the true Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry.
 Appropriate attention is a factor for stream-entry.
 Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry.

[The Buddha:] "There is the case, Bharadvaja, where a monk lives in dependence
 on a certain village or town.
 Then a householder or householder's son goes to him and observes him with
 regard to three mental qualities — qualities based on greed, qualities
 based on aversion, qualities based on delusion: 'Are there in this venerable
 one any such qualities based on greed that, with his mind overcome by these
 qualities, he might say, "I know," while not knowing, or say, "I see,"
 while not seeing; or that he might urge another to act in a way that was
 for his/her long-term harm & pain?' As he observes him, he comes to know,
 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed...
 His bodily behavior & verbal behavior are those of one not greedy.
 And the Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil,
 refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the
 wise.
 This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's greedy.

 on greed, he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion...

 say, "I know," while not knowing, or say, "I see," while not seeing; or
 that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his/her long-term

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based
 on delusion, he places conviction in him.
 With the arising of conviction, he visits him & grows close to him.
 Growing close to him, he lends ear.
 Lending ear, he hears the Dhamma.
 Hearing the Dhamma, he remembers it.
 Remembering it, he penetrates the meaning of those dhammas.
 Penetrating the meaning, he comes to an agreement through pondering those
 dhammas.
 There being an agreement through pondering those dhammas, desire arises.
 With the arising of desire, he becomes willing.
 Willing, he contemplates (lit: "weighs," "compares").
 Contemplating, he makes an exertion.
 Exerting himself, he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with
 his body and sees by penetrating it with discernment.

1.
 According to the Commentary, one's superiors include those who have more
 wisdom than oneself, more skill in concentration and other aspects of the
 path than oneself, and those senior to oneself.2.
 The Commentary says that the right time to see a teacher is when one is
 overcome with passion, aversion, and delusion, and cannot find a way out
 on one's own.
 This echoes a passage in AN 6.26, in which Ven.
 Maha Kaccana says that the right time to visit a "monk worthy of esteem"
 is when one needs help in overcoming any of the five hindrances or when
 one doesn't yet have an appropriate theme to focus on to put an end to
 the mind's fermentations.3.
 The Commentary equates "words destructive of the Dhamma" with "animal talk."

 when abandoned by three things — life, warmth, & consciousness — form is

 compassionate for the welfare of all living beings.
 Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what
 is not given.
 He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness
 that belong to others and have not been given by them.
 Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.
 He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their
 mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives,

 'Come & tell, good man, what you know': If he doesn't know, he says, 'I
 don't know.' If he does know, he says, 'I know.' If he hasn't seen, he says,
 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't
 consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for
 the sake of any reward.
 Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech.
 He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver
 of the world.
 Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech.
 What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart
 from these people here.
 What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart
 from those people there.
 Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are
 united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things
 that create concord.
 Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech.
 He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that
 go to the heart, that are polite, appealing & pleasing to people at large.
 Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter.
 He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pali canon recognizes four levels of awakening, the first of which is
 called stream-entry.
 The practices leading up to stream-entry are already discussed in the first
 part of this study guide.
 This second part covers the experience of stream-entry together with its
 results.
 The canonical passages treating the experience and its results use all
 three modes of discourse generally employed in the Canon: the narrative
 mode — stories about people who have attained stream-entry; the cosmological
 mode — descriptions of the after-death destinations awaiting those who
 have attained stream-entry; and what might be called the "emptiness" mode,
 which describes mental states in and of themselves as they are directly
 experienced as absent or present, both during and after stream-entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The material in this part of the study guide is presented in five sections.
 The first section, The Arising of the Dhamma Eye, discusses the experience
 of stream-entry, and concludes with a passage indicating why the experience
 is described in terms of the faculty of vision.
 The second section, The Three Fetters, discusses the three fetters of renewed
 existence that are cut with the arising of the Dhamma eye: self-identity
 views, uncertainty, and grasping at precepts and practices.
 The third section, The Character of the Stream-winner, discusses the personal
 characteristics of a stream-winner that flow directly from the cutting
 of the first three fetters.
 This section focuses on three lists of the four factors of stream-entry,
 which are not to be confused with the four factors for stream-entry discussed
 in the first part of this study guide.
 The fourth section, Rewards, discusses the rewards of stream-entry that
 come both in this life and in future lives.
 The final section, Advice, echoes the Buddha's last words to his disciples
 before entering total nibbana.
 The discourse reporting those words — DN 16 — also reports that the most
 backward of the monks present at the Buddha's passing away were stream-winners.
 The fact that his last words to them stressed the need for heedfulness
 underlies the fact that even stream-winners have to be wary of heedlessness.
 This is especially true in the present day, when many different meditation
 schools define the attainment of stream-entry in such different terms,
 raising the question of whose certification of stream-entry is valid and
 whose is not.
 The safest course of action for all meditators — whether certified as stream-wi
nners or not, and whether that certification is valid or not — is to maintain
 an attitude of heedfulness with regard to all mental qualities.

The coming-together of these factors is called the stream because it leads
 inevitably to two things, just as the current of a tributary will lead
 inevitably to a major river and then to the sea.
 In the immediate present, the stream leads directly to the arising of the
 Dhamma eye, the vision that actually constitutes this first awakening.
 Over time, the stream ensures that — in no more than seven lifetimes —
 one will be totally Unbound.

This standard formula — it is repeated throughout the Canon — may not seem
 that remarkable an insight.
 However, the texts make clear that this insight is not a matter of belief
 or contemplation, but of direct seeing.
 As the following passages show, belief and contemplation may be conducive
 to the seeing — and an undefined level of belief and discernment may actually
 guarantee that someday in this lifetime the seeing will occur — but only
 with the actual seeing does there come a dramatic shift in the course of
 one's life and one's relationship to the Dhamma.

The connection between Ven.
 Assaji's verse above, discussing causation, and the arising of the Dhamma
 eye in Sariputta suggests that realization conveyed by the Dhamma eye is
 not just an insight into the fleeting, impermanent nature of ordinary experienc

 Instead, it extends also to a realization of the conditioned, dependent
 nature of that experience.
 Other passages describing in more detail the knowledge of a stream-winner
 — one who has entered the stream — show that this is in fact the case.
 The Dhamma eye sees that things arise and pass away in line with a particular
 type of causality, in which the effects of causes are felt immediately

The fetter of grasping at precepts and practices is often described in the
 Pali canon with reference to the view that one becomes pure simply through
 performing rituals or patterns of behavior.
 This view in turn is related to the notion that one's being is defined
 by one's actions: if one acts in accordance with clearly defined precepts
 and practices, one is ipso facto pure.
 Although the Canon recognizes the importance of precepts and practices
 in the attaining the stream, the experience of the Deathless shows the
 person who has attained the stream that one cannot define oneself in terms
 of those precepts and practices.
 Thus one continues to follow virtuous practices, but without defining oneself
 in terms of them.

When these lists are collated, we arrive at four qualities that describe
 a stream-winner: conviction, virtue, generosity, and discernment.
 AN 8.54 describes these as "four qualities that lead to a lay person's happiness

 implications of each of these four as embodied in a stream-winner's behavior.

\begin_layout Standard
Conviction in the Triple Gem of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha is not simply
 a matter of belief or devotion.

 of action and result in line with which one first gained entry to the stream.

\begin_layout Standard
"Endowed with these five qualities, a lay follower is a jewel of a lay follower,
 a lotus of a lay follower, a fine flower of a lay follower.
 Which five? He/she has conviction; is virtuous; is not eager for protective

 does not search for recipients of his/her offerings outside (of the Sangha),
 and gives offerings here first."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtue, as practiced by the stream-winner, is also a function of a deep
 trust in the principle of kamma, and of a sympathy for others that arises
 from that trust.
 Although stream-winners may still break the minor rules of training, the
 depth of insight that informs their virtue ensures that their adherence
 to the basic principles of morality is unshakable.

Advice

\begin_layout Standard
Although it would be pleasant to conclude this study guide with the above
 passages of encouragement, we would probably do better to follow the example
 of the Buddha, who directed his last words to his stream-winner disciples,
 encouraging them not to rest content with the rewards awaiting them, but
 to maintain instead an attitude of heedfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And what is heedfulness? There is the case where a monk guards his mind
 with regard to [mental] fermentations and mental qualities accompanied
 by fermentations.
 When his mind is guarded with regard to fermentations and mental qualities
 accompanied by fermentations, the faculty of conviction goes to the culmination
 of its development.
 The faculty of persistence...
 mindfulness...
 concentration...
 discernment goes to the culmination of its development."

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early centuries after the Buddha's passing away, as Buddhism became
 a popular religion, the idea was formalized that there were three paths
 to awakening to choose from: the path to awakening as a disciple of a Buddha
 (savaka); the path to awakening as a private Buddha (pacceka-buddha), i.e.,
 one who attained awakening on his own but was not able to teach the path
 of practice to others; and the path to awakening as a Rightly Self-awakened
 Buddha (samma sambuddho).
 Each path was defined as consisting of perfections (parami) of character,
 but there was a question as to what those perfections were and how the
 paths differed from one another.
 The Theravadins, for instance, specified ten perfections, and organized
 their Jataka collection so that it culminated in ten tales, each illustrating
 one of the perfections.
 The Sarvastivadins, on the other hand, specified six perfections, and organized
 their Jataka collection accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All Buddhists agreed that the third path took by far the longest to follow,
 but disagreements arose as to whether the perfections developed along the
 different paths were quantitatively or qualitatively different.
 In other words, did a Buddha develop more of the same sort of perfections
 that an arahant developed, or did he develop perfections of a radically
 different sort? Those who believed that the perfections differed only quantitat
ively were able to take the early Buddhist canons as their guide to the
 path to Buddhahood, for they could simply extrapolate from the path of
 the arahant as described in those canons.
 Those seeking Buddhahood who believed that the perfections differed qualitative
ly, however, had to look outside the canons.
 People in this latter group often practiced a form of meditation aimed
 at inducing visions of bodhisattvas treading the path to full Buddhahood,
 along with Buddhas in other world-systems.
 These Buddhas and bodhisattvas — it was hoped — would provide an insider's
 knowledge of the full Buddha's path.
 The teachings that resulted from these visions were very diverse; not until
 the 3rd century C.E., with the development of the Yogacara school, was a
 concerted effort made to collate these various teachings into a single
 body — what we now know as the Mahayana movement — but the differences
 among these teachings were so great that the Mahayana never achieved true
 unity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, historically, there have been two major ways of following the path
 to full Buddhahood: following guidelines gleaned from the early canons,
 and following the traditions set in motion by the experiences of visionaries
 from the beginning of the common era.
 The materials in this study guide take the first course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a common misunderstanding that the Theravada school teaches only
 the savaka path, but a glance at Theravada history will show that many
 Theravadins have vowed to become bodhisattvas and have undertaken the practice
 of the ten perfections as set forth in the Theravadin jatakas.
 Because these perfections differ only quantitatively for arahants, Theravadins
 who aspire to arahantship cite the perfections as qualities that they are
 developing as part of their practice outside of formal meditation.
 For example, they make donations to develop the perfection of generosity,
 undertake building projects to develop the perfection of endurance, and
 so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For people in the modern world who are wrestling with the issue of how to
 practice the Dhamma in daily life, the perfections provide a useful framework
 for developing a fruitful attitude toward daily activities so that any
 activity or relationship undertaken wisely with the primary purpose of
 developing the perfections in a balanced way becomes part of the practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The perfections also provide one of the few reliable ways of measuring the
 accomplishments of one's life.
 "Accomplishments" in the realm of work and relationships have a way of
 turning into dust, but perfections of the character, once developed, are
 dependable and lasting, carrying one over and beyond the vicissitudes of
 daily living.
 Thus they deserve to take high priority in the way we plan our lives.
 These two facts are reflected in the two etymologies offered for the word
 perfection (parami): They carry one across to the further shore (param);
 and they are of foremost (parama) importance in formulating the purpose
 of one's life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The material in this study guide is organized under the heading of the eighth
 perfection — determination — for several reasons.
 The first reason is that determination is needed for undertaking the path
 of perfections to begin with, in that it gives focus, motivation, and direction
 to the practice.
 The second reason is that the four aspects of skilled determination — discernme
nt, truth, relinquishment, and calm — when studied carefully, cover all
 ten of the perfections: generosity, virtue, renunciation, discernment,
 persistence, endurance, truth, determination, good will, and equanimity.
 In this way, the material gathered here illustrates the general principle
 that each of the perfections, when properly practiced, includes all ten.
 The third reason is that the four aspects of skilled determination help
 guard against a common problem in using the perfections as a guide to practice:
 a tendency to indulge in the self-delusion that can justify any activity,
 no matter how inappropriate, as part of the path.
\end_layout

Passages in this guide are drawn from the Pali canon and from the teachings
 of Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress, knowledge with
 regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with regard to the cessation
 of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the
 cessation of stress: This is called right view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is right resolve? Resolve aimed at renunciation, at freedom from
 ill will, at harmlessness: This is called right resolve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 45.8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is the right view that has fermentations, sides with merit, & results
 in acquisitions? 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed.
 There are fruits & results of good & bad actions.
 There is this world & the next world.
 There is mother & father.
 There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are priests & contemplatives
 who, faring rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next
 after having directly known & realized it for themselves.' This is the right
 view that has fermentations, sides with merit, & results in acquisitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is the right view that is without fermentations, transcendent,
 a factor of the path? The discernment, the faculty of discernment, the
 strength of discernment, analysis of qualities as a factor of Awakening,
 the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind
 is noble, whose mind is free from fermentations, who is fully possessed
 of the noble path.
 This is the right view that is without fermentations, transcendent, a factor
 of the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One tries to abandon wrong view & to enter into right view: This is one's
 right effort.
 One is mindful to abandon wrong view & to enter & remain in right view:
 This is one's right mindfulness.
 Thus these three qualities — right view, right effort, & right mindfulness
 — run & circle around right view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[2] Of those, right view is the forerunner.
 And how is right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong resolve as wrong
 resolve, and right resolve as right resolve.
 And what is wrong resolve? Being resolved on sensuality, on ill will, on
 harmfulness.
 This is wrong resolve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is right resolve? Right resolve, I tell you, is of two sorts: There
 is right resolve with fermentations, siding with merit, resulting in the
 acquisitions [of becoming]; and there is noble right resolve, without fermentat
ions, transcendent, a factor of the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is the right resolve that has fermentations, sides with merit,
 & results in acquisitions? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from
 ill will, on harmlessness.
 This is the right resolve that has fermentations, sides with merit, & results
 in acquisitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is the right resolve that is without fermentations, transcendent,
 a factor of the path? The thinking, directed thinking, resolve, mental
 absorption, mental fixity, focused awareness, & verbal fabrications in
 one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without
 fermentations, who is fully possessed of the noble path.
 This is the right resolve that is without fermentations, transcendent,
 a factor of the path.

\begin_layout Standard
One tries to abandon wrong resolve & to enter into right resolve: This is
 one's right effort.
 One is mindful to abandon wrong resolve & to enter & remain in right resolve:
 This is one's right mindfulness.

 — run & circle around right resolve.

\begin_layout Standard
And what is the faculty of discernment? There is the case where a monk,
 a disciple of the noble ones, is discerning, endowed with discernment of
 arising & passing away — noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending
 of stress.
 He discerns, as it has come to be: 'This is stress...This is the origination
 of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is the path of practice leading
 to the cessation of stress.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 48.10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are mental qualities that are skillful & unskillful, blameworthy &
 blameless, gross & refined, siding with darkness & with light.
 To foster appropriate attention to them: This is the food for the arising
 of unarisen analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, or for the
 growth & increase of analysis of qualities ...
 once it has arisen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does discernment come from? You might compare it with learning to become
 a potter, a tailor, or a basket weaver.
 The teacher will start out by telling you how to make a pot, sew a shirt
 or a pair of pants, or weave different patterns, but the proportions and
 beauty of the object you make will have to depend on your own powers of
 observation.
 Suppose you weave a basket and then take a good look at its proportions,
 to see if it's too short or too tall.
 If it's too short, weave another one, a little taller, and then take a
 good look at it to see if there's anything that still needs improving,
 to see if it's too thin or too fat.
 Then weave another one, better-looking than the last.
 Keep this up until you have one that's as beautiful and well-proportioned
 as possible, one with nothing to criticize from any angle.
 This last basket you can take as your standard.
 You can now set yourself up in business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What you've done is to learn from your own actions.
 As for your previous efforts, you needn't concern yourself with them any
 longer.
 Throw them out.
 This is a sense of discernment that arises of its own accord, an ingenuity
 and sense of judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught
 you, but from observing and evaluating on your own the object that you
 yourself have made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same holds true in practicing meditation.
 For discernment to arise, you have to be observant as you keep track of
 the breath and to gain a sense of how to adjust and improve it so that
 it's well-proportioned throughout the body — to the point where it flows
 evenly without faltering, so that it' s comfortable in slow and out slow,
 in fast and out fast, long, short, heavy, or refined.
 Get so that both the in-breath and the out-breath are comfortable no matter
 what way you breathe, so that — no matter when — you immediately feel a
 sense of ease the moment you focus on the breath.
 When you can do this, physical results will appear: a sense of ease and
 lightness, open and spacious.
 The body will be strong, the breath and blood will flow unobstructed and
 won't form an opening for disease to step in.
 The body will be healthy and awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the mind, when mindfulness and alertness are the causes, a still
 mind is the result.
 When negligence is the cause, a mind distracted and restless is the result.
 So we must try to make the causes good, in order to give rise to the good
 results we've referred to.
 If we use our powers of observation and evaluation in caring for the breath,
 and are constantly correcting and improving it, we'll develop awareness
 on our own, the fruit of having developed our concentration higher step
 by step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— Ajaan Lee, Observe & Evaluate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma of attainment is something cool, clean, and clear.
 It doesn't take birth, age, grow ill, or die.
 Whoever works earnestly at the Dhamma of study and practice will give rise
 to the Dhamma of attainment without a doubt.
 The Dhamma of attainment is paccattam: You have to know it for yourself...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should make a point of searching for whatever will give rise to discernment.
 Sutamaya-pañña: Listen to things that are worth listening to.
 Cintamaya-pañña: Once you've listened, evaluate what you've learned.
 Don't accept it or reject it right off hand.
 Bhavanamaya-pañña: Once you've put what you've learned to the test, practice
 in line with it.
 This is the highest perfection of discernment — liberating insight.
 You know what kinds of stress and pain should be remedied and so you remedy
 them.
 You know what kinds shouldn't be remedied and so you don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part we're really ignorant.
 We try to remedy the things that shouldn't be remedied, and it just doesn't
 work — because there's one kind of stress that should simply be observed
 and shouldn't be fiddled with at all.
 Like a rusty watch: Don't polish away any more rust than you should.
 If you go taking it apart, the whole thing will stop running for good.
 What this means is that once you've seen natural conditions for what they
 truly are, you have to let them be.
 If you see something that should be fixed, you fix it.
 Whatever shouldn't be fixed, you don't.
 This takes a load off the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ignorant people are like the old woman who lit a fire to cook her rice and,
 when her rice was cooked, had her meal.
 When she had finished her meal, she sat back and had a cigar.
 It so happened that when she lit her cigar with one of the embers of the
 fire, it burned her mouth.
 'Damned fire,' she thought.
 'It burned my mouth.' So she put all her matches in a pile and poured water
 all over them so that there wouldn't be any more fire in the house — just
 like a fool with no sense at all.
 The next day, when she wanted fire to cook her meal, there wasn't any left.
 At night, when she wanted light, she had to go pestering her neighbors,
 asking this person and that, and yet still she hated fire.
 We have to learn how to make use of things and to have a sense of how much
 is enough.
 If you light only a little fire, it'll be three hours before your rice
 is cooked.
 The fire isn't enough for your food.
 So it is with us: We see stress as something bad and so try to remedy it
 — keeping at it with our eyes closed, as if we were blind.
 No matter how much we treat it, we never get anywhere at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People with discernment will see that stress is of two kinds: (1) physical
 stress, or the inherent stress of natural conditions; and (2) mental stress,
 or the stress of defilement.
 Once there's birth, there has to be aging, illness, and death.
 Whoever tries to remedy aging can keep at it till they're withered and
 gray.
 When we try to remedy illness, we're usually like the old woman pouring
 water all over her matches.
 Sometimes we treat things just right, sometimes we don't — as when the
 front step gets cracked, and we dismantle the house right up to the roof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Illness is something that everyone has, in other words, the diseases that
 appear in the various parts of the body.
 Once we've treated the disease in our eyes, it'll go appear in our ears,
 nose, in front, in back, in our arm, our hand, our foot, etc., and then
 it'll sneak inside.
 Like a person trying to catch hold of an eel: The more you try to catch
 it, the more it slips off every which way.
 And so we keep on treating our diseases till we die.
 Some kinds of disease will go away whether we treat them or not.
 If it's a disease that goes away with treatment, then take medicine.
 If it's one that goes away whether we treat it or not, why bother? This
 is what it means to have discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ignorant people don't know which kinds of stress should be treated and which
 kinds shouldn't, and so they put their time and money to waste.
 As for intelligent people, they see what should be treated and they treat
 it using their own discernment.
 All diseases arise either from an imbalance in the physical elements or
 from kamma.
 If it's a disease that arises from the physical elements, we should treat
 it with food, medicine, etc.
 If it arises from kamma, we have to treat it with the Buddha's medicine.
 In other words, stress and pain that arise from the heart, if we treat
 them with food and medicine, won't respond.
 We have to treat them with the Dhamma.
 Whoever knows how to manage this is said to have a sense of how to observe
 and diagnose stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we look at it in another way, we'll see that aging, illness, and death
 are simply the shadows of stress and not its true substance.
 People lacking discernment will try to do away with the shadows, which
 leads only to more suffering and stress.
 This is because they aren't acquainted with what the shadows and substance
 of stress come from.
 The essence of stress lies with the mind.
 Aging, illness, and death are its shadows or effects that show by way of
 the body.
 When we want to kill our enemy and so take a knife to stab his shadow,
 how is he going to die? In the same way, ignorant people try to destroy
 the shadows of stress and don't get anywhere.
 As for the essence of stress in the heart, they don't think of remedying
 it at all.
 This ignorance of theirs is one form of avijja, or unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To look at it in still another way, both the shadows and the real thing
 come from tanha, craving.
 We're like a person who has amassed a huge fortune and then, when thieves
 come to break in, goes killing the thieves.
 He doesn't see his own wrong-doing and sees only the wrong-doing of others.
 Actually, once he's piled his house full in this way, thieves can't help
 but break in.
 In the same way, people suffer from stress and so they hate it, and yet
 they don't make the effort to straighten themselves out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stress comes from the three forms of craving, so we should kill off craving
 for sensuality, craving for becoming, and craving for no becoming.
 These things are fabricated in our own heart, and we have to know them
 with our own mindfulness and discernment.
 Once we've contemplated them until we see, we'll know: 'This sort of mental
 state is craving for sensuality; this sort is craving for becoming; and
 this sort, craving for no becoming.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People with discernment will see that these things exist in the heart in
 subtle, intermediate, and blatant stages, just as a person has three stages
 in a lifetime: youth, middle age, and old age.
 'Youth' is craving for sensuality.
 Once this thirst arises in the heart, it wavers and moves — this is craving
 for becoming — and then takes shape as craving for no further becoming
 — a sambhavesin with its neck stretched out looking for its object, causing
 itself stress and pain.
 In other words, we take a liking to various sights, sounds, smells, flavors,
 etc., and so fix on them, which brings us stress.
 So we shouldn't preoccupy ourselves with sights, sounds, etc., that provoke
 greed, anger, or delusion (craving for sensuality), causing the mind to
 waver and whisk out with concepts (this is craving for becoming; when the
 mind sticks with its wavering, won't stop repeating its motions, that's
 craving for no further becoming).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we gain discernment, we should destroy these forms of craving with
 anulomika-ñana, knowledge in accordance with the four Noble Truths, knowing
 exactly how much ease and pleasure the mind has when cravings for sensuality,
 becoming, and no becoming all disappear.
 This is called knowing the reality of disbanding.
 As for the cause of stress and the path to the disbanding of stress, we'll
 know them as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ignorant people will go ride in the shadow of a car — and they'll end up
 with their heads bashed in.
 People who don't realize what the shadows of virtue are, will end up riding
 only the shadows.
 Words and deeds are the shadows of virtue.
 Actual virtue is in the heart.
 The heart at normalcy is the substance of virtue.
 The substance of concentration is the mind firmly centered in a single
 preoccupation without any interference from concepts or mental labels.
 The bodily side to concentration — when our mouth, eyes, ears, nose, and

For the heart to go and do harm to other people, we first have to open the
 way for it.
 In other words, we start out by doing harm to ourselves, and this clears
 the way from inside the house for us to go out and do harm to people outside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intention to do harm is a heavy form of self-harm.
 At the very least, it uses up our time and destroys our opportunity to
 do good.
 We have to wipe it out with the intention not to do harm — or in other
 words, with concentration.
 This is like seeing that there's plenty of unused space in our property
 and that we aren't making enough for our living.
 We'll have to leap out into the open field so as to give ourself the momentum
 for doing our full measure of goodness as the opportunity arises...

\begin_layout Standard
Nekkhamma-sankappo (thoughts of renunciation), i.e., being at ease in quiet,
 solitary places.
 Abyapada-sankappo (thoughts of non-anger): We don't have to think about
 our own bad points or the bad points of others.
 Avihinsa-sankappo (thoughts of not doing harm), not creating trouble or
 doing harm to ourselves, i.e., (1) not thinking about our own shortcomings,
 which would depress us; (2) if we think about our own shortcomings, it'll
 spread like wildfire to the shortcomings of others.
 For this reason, wise people lift their thoughts to the level of goodness
 so that they can feel love and good will for themselves, and so that they
 can then feel love and good will for others as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When our mind has these three forms of energy, it's like a table with three
 legs that can spin in all directions.
 To put it another way, once our mind has spun up to this high a level,
 we can take pictures of everything above and below us.
 We'll develop discernment like a bright light or like binoculars that can
 magnify every detail.
 This is called ñana — intuitive awareness that can know everything in the
 world: Lokavidu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discernment here isn't ordinary knowledge or insight.
 It's a special cognitive skill, the skill of the Noble Path.
 We'll give rise to three eyes in the heart, so as to see the reds and greens,
 the highs and lows of the mundane world: a sport for those with wisdom.
 Our internal eyes will look at the Dhamma in front and behind, above and
 below and all around us, so as to know all the ins and outs of goodness
 and evil.
 This is discernment.
 We'll be at our ease, feeling pleasure with no pain interfering at all.
 This is called vijja-carana-sampanno — being fully equipped with cognitive
 skill...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whoever sees the world as having highs and lows doesn't yet have true intuitive
 discernment.
 Whoever has the eye of intuition will see that there are no highs, no lows,
 no rich, no poor.
 Everything is equal in terms of the three common characteristics: inconstant,
 stressful, and not-self.
 It's like the equality of democracy.
 Their home is the same as our home, with no differences at all.
 People commit burglaries and robberies these days because they don't see
 equality.
 They think that this person is good, that person isn't; this house is a
 good place to eat, that house isn't; this house is a good place to sleep,
 that house isn't, etc.
 It's because they don't have insight, the eye of discernment, that there's
 all this confusion and turmoil...

If we can get our practice on the Noble Path, we'll enter nibbana.
 Virtue will disband, concentration will disband, discernment will disband.
 In other words, we won't dwell on our knowledge or discernment.
 If we're intelligent enough to know, we simply know, without taking intelligenc
e as being an essential part of ourselves.
 On the lower level, we're not stuck on virtue, concentration, or discernment.
 On a higher level, we're not stuck on the stages of stream-entry, once-returnin
g, or non-returning.
 Nibbana isn't stuck on the world, the world isn't stuck on nibbana.
 Only at this point can we use the term 'arahant'.

 They can say inconstant, but it's just what they say.

 Whatever they say, that's the way it is.
 It's true for them, and they're completely right — but completely wrong.
 As for us, only if we can get ourselves beyond right and wrong will we
 be doing fine.
 Roads are built for people to walk on, but dogs and cats can walk on them
 as well.
 Sane people and crazy people will use the roads: They didn't build the
 roads for crazy people, but crazy people have every right to use them.
 As for the precepts, even fools and idiots can observe them.
 The same with concentration: Crazy or sane, they can come and sit.
 And discernment: We all have the right to come and talk our heads off,
 but it's simply a question of being right or wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of the valuables of the mundane world give any real pleasure.
 They're nothing but stress.
 They're good as far as the world is concerned, but nibbanadoesn't have
 any need for them.
 Right views and wrong views are an affair of the world.
 Nibbana doesn't have any right views or wrong views.
 For this reason, whatever is a wrong view, we should abandon.
 Whatever is a right view, we should develop — until the day it can fall
 from our grasp.
 That's when we can be at our ease.

Anger.
 When this defilement really gets strong, it has no sense of good or evil,
 right or wrong, husband, wives, or children.
 It can drink human blood.
 An example we often see is when people get quarreling and one of them ends
 up in prison or even on death row, convicted for murder.
 This is even worse than your house burning down, because you have nothing
 left at all.
 For this reason, we have to get ourselves some life insurance by observing
 the five or eight precepts so that we can treat and bandage our open sores
 — i.e., so that we can wash away the evil and unwise things in our thoughts,
 words, and deeds.
 Even if we can't wash them all away, we should try at least to relieve
 them somewhat.
 Although you may still have some fire left, let there just be enough to
 cook your food or light your home.
 Don't let there be so much that it burns your house down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only way to put out these fires is to meditate and develop thoughts
 of good will.
 The mind won't feel any anger, hatred, or ill will, and instead will feel
 nothing but thoughts of sympathy, seeing that everyone in the world aims
 at goodness, but that our goodness isn't equal.
 You have to use really careful discernment to consider cause and effect,
 and then be forgiving, with the thought that we human beings aren't equal
 or identical in our goodness and evil.
 If everyone were equal, the world would fall apart.
 If we were equally good or equally bad, the world would have to fall apart
 for sure.
 Suppose that all the people in the world were farmers, with no merchants
 or government officials.
 Or suppose there were only government officials, with no farmers at all:
 We'd all starve to death with our mouths gaping and dry.
 If everyone were equal and identical, the end of the world would come in
 only a few days' time.
 Consider your body: Even the different parts of your own body aren't equal.
 Some of your fingers are short, some are long, some small, some large.
 If all ten of your fingers were equal, you'd have a monster's hands.
 So when even your own fingers aren't equal, how can you expect people to
 be equal in terms of their thoughts, words, and deeds? You have to think
 this way and be forgiving...

\begin_layout Standard
When you can think in this way, your good will can spread to all people
 everywhere, and you'll feel sympathy for people on high levels, low levels

 will and loving kindness.

This comes from getting life insurance: practicing tranquillity meditation
 so as to chase the defilements away from the mind.
 Thoughts of sensual desire, ill will, lethargy, restlessness, and uncertainty
 will vanish, and the mind will be firmly centered in concentration, using
 its powers of directed thought to stay with its meditation word — buddho
 — and its powers of evaluation to create a sense of inner lightness and
 ease.
 When the mind fills itself with rapture — the flavor arising from concentration
 — it will have its own inner food and nourishment, so that whatever you
 do in thought, word, or deed is sure to succeed.

So Kapadika Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One, "Master Gotama, with regard

 have to say to this?"

 In the same way, the statement of the brahmans turns out to be a row of
 blind men, as it were: the first one doesn't see, the middle one doesn't
 see, the last one doesn't see.
 So what do you think, Bharadvaja: this being the case, doesn't the conviction

The Buddha saw that the ease and happiness of ordinary pleasures is nothing
 lasting.
 He wanted an ease and happiness that didn't follow the way of the worldly
 pleasures that most people want.
 This was why he left his family and friends, and went off to live in seclusion.
 He said to himself, 'I came alone when I was born and I'll go alone when
 I die.
 No one hired me to be born and no one will hire me to die, so I'm beholden
 to no one.
 There's no one I have to fear.
 In all of my actions, if there's anything that is right from the standpoint
 of the world, but wrong from the standpoint of the truth — and wrong from
 the standpoint of my heart — there's no way I'll be willing to do it.'
\end_layout

So he posed himself a question: 'Now that you've been born as a human being,
 what is the highest thing you want in this world?' He then placed the following
 conditions on his answer: 'In answering, you have to be really honest and
 truthful with yourself.
 And once you've answered, you have to hold to your answer as an unalterable
 law on which you've affixed your seal, without ever letting a second seal
 be affixed on top.
 So what do you want, and how do you want it? You have to give an honest
 answer, understand? I won't accept anything false.
 And once you've answered, you have to keep to your answer.
 Don't be a traitor to yourself.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he was sure of his answer, he said to himself, 'I want only the highest
 and most certain happiness and ease: the happiness that won't change into
 anything else.
 Other than that, I don't want anything else in the world.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he had given this answer, he kept to it firmly.
 He didn't allow anything that would have caused the least bit of pain or
 distraction to his heart to get stuck there as a stain on it.
 He kept making a persistent effort with all his might to discover the truth,
 without retreat, until he finally awakened to that truth: the reality of

If we search for the truth like the Buddha — if we're true in our intent
 and true in what we do — there's no way the truth can escape us.
 But if we aren't true to ourselves, we won't find the true happiness the
 Buddha found.
 We tell ourselves that we want to be happy but we go jumping into fires.
 We know what things are poison, yet we go ahead and drink them anyway.
 This is called being a traitor to yourself...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every person alive wants happiness — even common animals struggle to find
 happiness — but our actions for the most part aren't in line with our intention
s.
 This is why we don't get to realize the happiness we want, simply because
 there's no truth to us.
 For example, when people come to the monastery: If they come to make offerings,
 observe the precepts, and sit in meditation for the sake of praise or a
 good reputation, there's no real merit to what they're doing.
 They don't gain any real happiness from it, so they end up disappointed
 and dissatisfied.
 Then they start saying that offerings, precepts, and meditation don't give
 any good results.
 Instead of reflecting on the fact that they weren't right and honest in
 doing these things, they say that there's no real good to the Buddha, Dhamma,
 and Sangha, that the Buddha's teachings are a lot of nonsense and lies.
 But actually the Buddha's teachings are an affair of the truth.
 If a person isn't true to the Buddha's teachings, the Buddha's teachings
 won't be true to that person — and that person won't be able to know what
 the Buddha's true teachings are...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we practice virtue, concentration, and discernment, it's as if we were
 taking the jewels and robes of royalty and the Noble Ones to dress up our
 heart and make it beautiful.
 But if we aren't true in our practice, it's like taking robes and jewels
 and giving them to a monkey.
 The monkey is bound to get them dirty and tear them to shreds because it
 has no sense of beauty at all.
 Whoever sees this kind of thing happening is sure to see right through
 it, that it's a monkey show.
 Even though the costumes are genuine, the monkey inside isn't genuine like
 the costumes.
 For instance, if you take a soldier's cap and uniform to dress it up as
 a soldier, it's a soldier only as far as the cap and uniform, but the monkey
 inside is still a monkey and not a soldier at all.
\end_layout

For this reason, the Buddha teaches us to be true in whatever we do — to

 Don't play around at these things.

\begin_layout Standard
There are three levels of virtue —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Hetthima-sila: normalcy of word and deed, which consists of three kinds
 of bodily acts — not killing, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct;
 and four kinds of speech — not lying, not speaking divisively, not saying
 anything coarse or abusive, not speaking idly.
 If we class virtue on this level according to the wording of the precepts
 and the groups of people who observe them, there are four — the five precepts,
 the eight, the ten, and the 227 precepts.
 All of these deal with aspects of behavior that should be abandoned, termed
 pahana-kicca.
 At the same time, the Buddha directed us to develop good manners and proper
 conduct in the use of the four necessities of life — food, clothing, shelter,
 and medicine — so that our conduct in terms of thought, word, and deed
 will be orderly and becoming.
 This aspect is termed bhavana-kicca, behavior we should work at developing
 correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observance of these precepts or rules — dealing merely with words and deeds
 — forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue, which is what makes us
 into full-fledged human beings (manussa-sampatti).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Majjhima-sila:the medium level of virtue, i.e., keeping watch over your words
 and deeds so that they cause no harm; and, in addition, keeping watch over
 your thoughts so as to keep your mental kamma upright in three ways —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 Anabhijjha-visamalobha: not coveting things that do not belong to you and
 that lie beyond your scope or powers; not focusing your thoughts on such
 things; not building what are called castles in the air.
 The Buddha taught us to tend to the wealth we already have so that it can
 grow on its own.
 The wealth we already have, if we use our intelligence and ingenuity, will
 draw more wealth our way without our having to waste energy by being covetous
 or greedy.
 For example, suppose we have a single banana tree: If we water it, give
 it fertilizer, loosen the soil around its roots, and protect it from dangers,
 our single banana tree will eventually give rise to an increase of other
 banana trees.
 In other words, if we're intelligent we can turn whatever wealth we have
 into a basis for a livelihood.
 But if we lack intelligence — if our hearts simply want to get, without
 wanting work — then even if we acquire a great deal of wealth, we won't
 be able to support ourselves.
 Thus, greed of this sort, in which we focus our desires above and beyond
 our capacities, is classed as a wrong kind of mental action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.
 Abyapada: abandoning thoughts of ill will, hatred, and vengeance, and developin
g thoughts of good will instead; thinking of the good aspects of the people
 who have angered us.
 When people make us angry, it comes from the fact that our dealings with
 them — in which we associate with and assist one another — sometimes lead
 to disappointment.
 This gives rise to dislike and irritation, which in turn cause us to brood,
 so that we develop hurt feelings that grow into anger and thoughts of retaliati
on.
 Thus we should regard such people from many angles, for ordinarily as human
 beings they should have some good to them.
 If they don't act well toward us, they may at least speak well to us.
 Or if they don't act or speak well to us, perhaps their thoughts may be
 well-meaning to at least some extent.
 Thus, when you find your thoughts heading in the direction of anger or
 dislike, you should sit down and think in two ways —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Try to think of whatever ways that person has been good to you.
 When these things come to mind, they'll give rise to feelings of affection,
 love, and good will.
 This is one way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Anger is something worthless, like the scum floating on the surface
 of a lake.
 If we're stupid, we won't get to drink the clean water lying underneath;
 or if we drink the scum, we may catch a disease.
 A person who is bad to you is like someone sunk in filth.
 If you're stupid enough to hate or be angry with such people, it's as if
 you wanted to go sit in the filth with them.
 Is that what you want? Think about this until any thoughts of ill will
 and anger disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.
 Samma-ditthi: abandoning wrong views and mental darkness.
 If our minds lack the proper training and education, we may come to think
 that we and all other living beings are born simply as accidents of nature;
 that 'father' and 'mother' have no special meaning; that good and evil
 don't exist.
 Such views deviate from the truth.
 They can dissuade us from restraining the evil that lies within us and
 from searching for and fostering the good.
 To believe that there's no good or evil, that death is annihilation, is
 Wrong View — a product of short-sighted thinking and poor discernment,
 seeing things for what they aren't.
 So we should abandon such views and educate ourselves, searching for knowledge
 of the Dhamma and associating with people wiser than we, so that they can
 show us the bright path.
 We'll then be able to reform our views and make them Right, which is one
 form of mental uprightness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtue on this level, when we can maintain it well, will qualify us to be
 heavenly beings.
 The qualities of heavenly beings, which grow out of human values, will
 turn us into human beings who are divine in our virtues, for to guard our
 thoughts, words, and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetime.
 This is one aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the
 middle level of virtue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Uparima-sila: higher virtue, where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the
 area of mental activity.
 There are two sides to higher virtue —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 PAHANA-KICCA: qualities to be abandoned, which are of five sorts —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Kamachanda: affection, desire, laxity, infatuation.(2) Byapada: ill will
 and hatred.(3) Thina-middha: discouragement, drowsiness, sloth.(4) Uddhacca-kukku
cca: restlessness and anxiety.(5) Vicikiccha: doubt, uncertainty, indecision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DISCUSSION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Ill will (byapada) lies at the essence of killing (panatipata), for
 it causes us to destroy our own goodness and that of others — and when
 our mind can kill off our own goodness, what's to keep us from killing
 other people and animals as well?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Restlessness (uddhacca) lies at the essence of taking what isn't given
 (adinnadana).
 The mind wanders about, taking hold of other people's affairs, sometimes
 their good points, sometimes their bad.
 To fasten onto their good points isn't too serious, for it can give us
 at least some nourishment.
 As long as we're going to steal other people's business and make it our
 own, we might as well take their silver and gold.
 Their bad points, though, are like trash they've thrown away — scraps and
 bones with nothing of any substance — and yet even so we let the mind feed
 on them.
 When we know that other people are possessive of their bad points and guard
 them well and yet we still take hold of these things to think about, it
 should be classed as a form of taking what isn't given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Sensual desires (kamachanda) lie at the essence of sensual misconduct.
 The mind feels an attraction for sensual objects — thoughts of past or
 future sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations — or for sensual
 defilements — passion, aversion, or delusion — to the point where we forget
 ourselves.
 Mental states such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety
 in sensual matters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Doubt (vicikiccha) lies at the essence of lying.
 In other words, our minds are unsure, with nothing reliable or true to
 them.
 We have no firm principles and so drift along under the influence of all
 kinds of thoughts and preoccupations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) Drowsiness (thina-middha) is intoxication — discouragement, dullness,
 forgetfulness, with no mindfulness or restraint watching over the mind.
 This is what it means to be drugged or drunk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these unskillful qualities are things we should eliminate by training
 the heart along the lines of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.
 BHAVANA-KICCA: qualities to be developed —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Mindfulness (sati): Start out by directing your thoughts to an object,
 such as your in-and-out breathing.
 Use mindfulness to steady the mind in its object throughout both the in-breath
 and the out-.
 Vitakka, thinking in this way, is what kills off sensual desires, in that
 the discipline of mindfulness keeps the mind from slipping off into external
 objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Vicara: Evaluate and be observant.
 Make yourself aware of whether or not you've received a sense of comfort
 and relaxation from your in- and out-breathing.
 If not, tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of ways: e.g., in long
 and out long, in long and out short, in short and out short, in short and
 out long, in slow and out slow, in fast and out fast, in gently and out
 gently, in strong and out strong, in throughout the body and out throughout
 the body.
 Adjust the breath until it gives good results to both body and mind, and
 you'll be able to kill off feelings of ill will and hatred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Piti: When you get good results — for instance, when the subtle breath
 sensations in the body merge and flow together, permeating the entire sense
 of the body — the breath is like an electric wire; the various parts of
 the body, such as the bones, are like electricity poles; mindfulness and
 alertness are like a power source; and awareness is thus bright and radiant.
 Both body and mind feel satisfied and full.
 This is piti, or rapture, which can kill off feelings of drowsiness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Sukha: Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared,
 a sense of pleasure and ease arises for both body and mind.
 This pleasure is what kills off restlessness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) Ekaggata: Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distance.
 The mind reaches singleness of preoccupation in a state of normalcy and
 equilibrium.
 This normalcy of mind, which is maintained through the power of the discipline
 of mindfulness (sati-vinaya), forms the essence of virtue: firmness, steadiness
, stability.
 And the resulting flavor or nourishment of virtue is a solitary sense of
 calm for the mind.
 When freedom of this sort arises within us, this is called the development
 of silanussati, the mindfulness of virtue.
 This is virtue that attains excellence — leading to the paths, their fruitions,
 and nibbana — and thus can be called uparima-sila, higher virtue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, there are three levels of virtue: external, intermediate,
 and internal.
 In ultimate terms, however, there are two —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Mundane virtue: virtue connected with the world, in which we maintain the
 principles of ordinary human morality but are as yet unable to reach the
 transcendent levels: stream entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantsh
ip.
 We can't yet cut the Fetters (sanyojana) that tie the heart to the influences
 of all the worlds.
 This is thus called mundane virtue.
 2.
 Transcendent virtue: virtue that's constant and sure, going straight to
 the heart, bathing the heart with its nourishment.
 This arises from the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight meditation.
 tranquillity meditation forms the cause, and insight meditation the result:
 discovering the true nature of the properties, aggregates (khandhas), and
 senses; seeing clearly the four Noble Truths, in proportion to our practice
 of the Path, and abandoning the first three of the Fetters —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 Sakkaya-ditthi (self-identity views): views that see the body or the aggregates
 as in the self or as belonging to the self.
 Ordinarily, we may be convinced that views of this sort are mistaken, yet
 we can't really abandon them.
 But when we clearly see that they're wrong for sure, this is called Right
 View — seeing things as they truly are — which can eliminate such wrong
 views as seeing the body as belonging to the self, or the self as the five
 aggregates, or the five aggregates as in the self.
 b.
 Vicikiccha: doubt about what's genuine and true, and what's counterfeit
 and false.
 The power of Right View allows us to see that the quality to which we awaken
 exists at all times and that the true qualities enabling us to awaken also
 exist and are made effective through the power of the practices we're following.
 Our knowledge is definite and true.
 Our doubts about the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha are cleared
 up for good.
 This is called becoming a niyata-puggala, a person who is certain and sure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.
 Silabbata-paramasa: When the heart abandons this Fetter, it no longer fondles
 theories concerning moral virtue; it's no longer stuck merely on the level
 of manners and activities.
 Good and evil are accomplished through the heart; activities are something
 separate.
 Even though people who reach this level do good — taking the precepts,
 making gifts and offerings, or meditating in line with the good customs
 of the world — they're not caught up on any of these things, because their
 hearts have reached the nourishment of virtue.
 They aren't stuck on the particulars (byañjana), i.e., their activities;
 nor are they stuck on the purpose (attha), i.e., the meaning or intent of
 their various good manners.
 Their hearts dwell in the nourishment of virtue: tranquillity, stability,
 normalcy of mind.
 Just as a person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating
 his body isn't stuck on either the food or its flavor — because he's received
 the benefits of the nourishment it provides — in the same way, the hearts
 of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on
 activities or manners, particulars or purposes, because they've tasted
 virtue's nourishment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is thus classed as transcendent virtue, the first stage of nibbana.
 Even though such people may be destined for further rebirth, they're special
 people, apart from the ordinary.
 Anyone whose practice reaches this level can be counted as fortunate, as
 having received dependable wealth, like ingots of gold.
 Just as gold can be used as currency all over the world because it has
 special value for all human beings — unlike paper currency, whose use is
 limited to specific countries — in the same way, a heart that has truly
 attained virtue has a value in this life that will remain constant in lives
 to come.
 Thus, a person who has reached this level has received part of the Noble
 Wealth of those who practice the religion.

Inner wealth, according to the texts, means seven things — conviction, virtue,
 a sense of conscience, scrupulousness, breadth of learning, generosity,
 and discernment — but to put it simply, inner wealth refers to the inner
 quality we build within ourselves.
 Outer wealth — money and material goods — doesn't have any hard and fast
 owners.
 Today it may be ours, tomorrow someone else may take it away.
 There are times when it belongs to us, and times when it belongs to others.
 Even with things that are fixed in the ground, like farms or orchards,
 you can't keep them from changing hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when you develop yourself so as to gain the discernment that sees how
 worldly things are undependable and unsure, don't let your property — your
 worldly possessions — sit idle.
 The Buddha teaches us to plant crops on our land so that we can benefit
 from it.
 If you don't make use of your land, it's sure to fall into other people's
 hands.
 In other words, when we stake out a claim to a piece of property, we should
 plant it full of crops.
 Otherwise the government won't recognize our claim, and we'll lose our
 rights to it.
 Even if we take the case to court, we won't have a chance to win.
 So once you see the weakness of an idle claim, you should hurry up and
 plant crops on it so that the government will recognize your claim and
 issue you a title to the land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this means is that we should make use of our material possessions by
 being generous with them, using them in a way that develops the inner wealth
 of generosity within us.
 This way they become the kind of wealth over which we have full rights,
 and that will benefit us even into future lifetimes.

One of the important reasons why the Buddha taught the Dhamma was to teach
 us to let go, not to hold on to things.
 The more we really know the Dhamma, the more we can let go.
 Those who know a little can let go of a little; those who know a lot can
 let go of a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first step we're taught dana — to be generous, to give donations —
 as a strategy for getting us to learn how to let go.
 The next step is caga — renouncing rights of possession — which is letting
 go at a higher level than dana.
 And finally, on a more refined level, we're taught to relinquish all our
 upadhi, or the acquisition-defilements in the mind.
 This is the level on which we examine and explore until we can gain total
 release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dana means giving away material things.
 If we don't give them away, they're hard to let go.
 For the most part, if we don't give things away, we hold rights over them
 and regard them as belonging to us.
 But if we give them away, we no longer have any rights over them.
 Things we hold onto are dangerous.
 (1) They can cause us harm.
 (2) They cause harm to people who steal them from us.
 And (3) once those people have stolen them, then they claim rights over
 them.
 The Buddha saw these dangers, which is why he taught us to be generous,
 to learn how to give things away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People who develop the habit of being generous reap many rewards.
 Their act of generosity comes back to them both in the present and on into
 the future.
 They have lots of friends.
 Other people trust them.
 Their hearts are light — they aren't weighed down with worries about looking
 after the things they've given away.
 And these same results will keep coming in the future, just as when we
 have a bucket of rice grains: if we plant them in a field, we'll reap ten
 buckets of rice in return.
 The same holds true with the goodness we develop in this lifetime.
 It gives enormous returns.
 That's how people of discernment understand it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caga is the next step.
 Dana is something that even crazy people can do, but caga is a type of
 giving that only wise people can do, because their sense of personal possession
 has to end immediately in the act of giving.
 They see that all material things are common property: things don't really
 belong to us, they don't really belong to other people.
 If you see things as belonging to you, that's addiction to sensuality (kamasukh
allikanuyoga).
 If you see things as belonging to others, that's addiction to self-affliction
 (attakilamathanuyoga).
 When we're born, we didn't bring anything along with us when we came.
 When we die, we won't take anything along when we go.
 So what really belongs to us? Our sense of possession has to fall away
 from the heart if our giving is to count as caga.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third level of letting go is relinquishing what's in the heart.
 Whether or not we give things away, we let go of them in the heart every
 day.
 We let go of the things we have.
 We let go of the things we don't have.
 Just as a person has to wash his mouth and hands every day after he eats
 if he wants to stay clean at all times.
 What this means is that we're not willing to let anything act as an enemy
 to the heart by making us stingy or grasping.
 If we don't do this, we're the type of person who doesn't wash up after
 a meal.
 We're not clean.
 We stay asleep without ever waking up.
 But when we let go in this way, it's called viraga-dhamma, or dispassion.
 The lower levels of letting go are things we can do only from time to time.
 Dispassion is something we can develop always.

Then Ven.
 Ananda, together with Tapussa the householder, went to the Blessed One
 and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.
 As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Tapussa the householder,
 here, has said to me, 'Venerable Ananda, sir, we are householders who indulge
 in sensuality, delight in sensuality, enjoy sensuality, rejoice in sensuality.
 For us — indulging in sensuality, delighting in sensuality, enjoying sensuality
, rejoicing in sensuality — renunciation seems like a sheer drop-off.
 Yet I've heard that in this doctrine & discipline the hearts of the very
 young monks leap up at renunciation, grow confident, steadfast, & firm,
 seeing it as peace.
 So right here is where this doctrine & discipline is contrary to the great
 mass of people: i.e., [this issue of] renunciation.'"

 Even I myself, before my Awakening, when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta,
 thought: 'Renunciation is good.
 Seclusion is good.' But my heart didn't leap up at renunciation, didn't
 grow confident, steadfast, or firm, seeing it as peace.
 The thought occurred to me: 'What is the cause, what is the reason, why
 my heart doesn't leap up at renunciation, doesn't grow confident, steadfast,
 or firm, seeing it as peace?' Then the thought occurred to me: 'I haven't
 seen the drawback of sensual pleasures; I haven't pursued [that theme].
 I haven't understood the reward of renunciation; I haven't familiarized
 myself with it.
 That's why my heart doesn't leap up at renunciation, doesn't grow confident,
 steadfast, or firm, seeing it as peace.'

The important factors for anyone practicing to gain release from all stress
 and suffering are persistence and endurance, for every kind of goodness
 has to have obstacles blocking the way, always ready to destroy it.
 Even when the Buddha himself was putting his effort into the practice,
 the armies of Mara were right on his heels, pestering him all the time,
 trying to keep him from attaining his goal.
 Still, he never wavered, never got discouraged, never abandoned his efforts.
 He took his perfection of truthfulness and used it to drive away the forces
 of Mara until they were utterly defeated.
 He was willing to put his life on the line in order to do battle with the
 forces of Mara, his heart solid, unflinching, and brave.
 This was why he was eventually able to attain a glorious victory, realizing
 the unexcelled right self-awakening, becoming our Buddha.
 This is an important example that he as our "father" set for his descendants
 to see and to take to heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when we're intent on training our minds to be good, there are bound to
 be obstacles — the forces of Mara — just as in the case of the Buddha,
 but we simply have to slash our way through them, using our powers of endurance
 and the full extent of our abilities to fight them off.
 It's only normal that when we have something good, there are going to be
 other people who want what we've got, in the same way that sweet fruit
 tends to have worms and insects trying to eat it.
 A person walking along the road empty-handed doesn't attract anyone's attention
, but if we're carrying something of value, there are sure to be others
 who will want what we've got, and will even try to steal it from us.
 If we're carrying food in our hand, dogs or cats will try to snatch it.
 But if we don't have any food in our hand, they won't pounce on us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's the same way when we practice.
 When we do good, we have to contend with obstacles if we want to succeed.
 We have to make our hearts hard and solid like diamond or rock, which don't
 burn when you try to set them on fire.
 Even when they get smashed, the pieces maintain their hardness as diamond
 and rock.
 The Buddha made his heart so hard and solid that when his body was cremated,
 parts of it didn't burn and still remain as relics for us to admire even
 today.
 This was through the power of his purity and truthfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we should set our minds on purifying our bodies and minds until they
 become so truly elemental that fire won't burn them, just like the Buddha's
 relics.
 Even if we can't get them to be that hard, at least we should make them
 like tamarind seeds in their casing: even if insects bore through the casing
 and eat all the flesh of the tamarind fruit, they can't do anything to
 the seeds, which maintain their hardness as always.

To purify the heart, we have to disentangle our attachments to self, to
 the body, to mental phenomena, and to all the objects that come passing
 in through the senses.
 Keep the mind intent on concentration.
 Keep it one at all times.
 Don't let it become two, three, four, five, etc., because once you've made
 the mind one, it's easy to make it zero.
 Simply cut off the little 'head' and pull the two ends together.
 But if you let the mind become many, it's a long, difficult job to make
 it zero.

And another thing: If you put the zero after other numbers, they become
 ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, hundreds, thousands, on to infinity.
 But if you put the zero's first, even if you have ten thousand of them,
 they don't count.
 So it is with the heart: Once we've turned it from one to zero and put
 the zero first, then other people can praise or criticize us as they like
 but it won't count.
 Good doesn't count, bad doesn't count.
 This is something that can't be written, can't be read, that we can understand

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the
 Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park.
 Now at that time Mahanama...
 went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one
 side.
 As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "I have heard that
 many monks are at work making robes for the Blessed One, [thinking], 'When
 the robes are finished, at the end of the three months, the Blessed One
 will set out wandering.' For those of us living by means of various dwelling
 places [for the mind], by means of which dwelling place should we live?"

 awakened, blessed.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollectin

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi
 at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migara's mother.
 Now at that time — it being the Uposatha day — Visakha, Migara's mother,
 went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having
 bowed down to him, sat to one side.
 As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her, "Well now, Visakha,
 why are you coming in the middle of the day?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Today I'm observing the Uposatha, lord."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Visakha, there are these three Uposathas.
 Which three? The Uposatha of a cowherd, the Uposatha of the Jains, and
 the Uposatha of the Noble Ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And what is the Uposatha of a cowherd? Just as when a cowherd returns the
 cattle to their owners in the evening, he reflects: 'Today the cattle wandered
 to that spot and this; they drank at this spot and that; tomorrow they
 will wander to that spot and this; they will drink at this spot and that';
 in the same way, there is the case where a certain person observing the
 Uposatha reflects, 'Today I ate this sort of non-staple food and that sort
 of staple food.
 Tomorrow I will eat that sort of non-staple food and this sort of staple
 food.' He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness,
 with that greed.
 Such is the Uposatha of a cowherd, Visakha.
 When this Uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken, it is not of great fruit
 or great benefit, not of great glory or radiance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And what is the Uposatha of the Jains? There are the contemplatives called
 the Niganthas (Jains).
 They get their disciple to undertake the following practice: 'Here, my
 good man.
 Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than 100 leagues to
 the east...
 more than 100 leagues to the west...
 more than 100 leagues to the north...
 more than 100 leagues to the south.' Thus they get the disciple to undertake
 kindness & sympathy to some beings, but not to others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"On the Uposatha day, they get their disciple to undertake the following
 practice: 'Here, my good man.
 Having stripped off all your clothing, say this: "I am nothing by anything
 or of anything.
 Thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine."' Yet in
 spite of that, his parents know of him that 'This is our child.' And he
 knows of them that 'These are my parents.' His wives & children know of
 him that 'This is our husband & father.' And he knows of them that 'These
 are my wives & children.' His workers & slaves know of him that 'This is
 our master.' And he knows of them that 'These are my workers & slaves.' Thus
 at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness, he is
 persuaded to undertake falsehood.
 At the end of the night, he resumes the consumption of his belongings,
 even though they aren't given back to him.
 This counts as stealing, I tell you.
 Such is the Uposatha of the Jains, Visakha.
 When this Uposatha of the Jains is undertaken, it is not of great fruit
 or great benefit, not of great glory or radiance.

 mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure
 born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
 He permeates & pervades, suffuses & fills this very body with the rapture
 & pleasure born from withdrawal.
 Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder
 into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again & again with

 There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture & pleasure born
 from withdrawal.

 related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning
 his mind gathers & settles inwardly, grows unified & centered.

 Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow
 from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies supplying abundant
 showers time & again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within
 the lake would permeate & pervade, suffuse & fill it with cool waters,

 suffuses & fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture.
 Just as in a lotus pond, some of the lotuses, born & growing in the water,
 stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the
 water, so that they are permeated & pervaded, suffused & filled with cool
 water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This anthology, drawn from the teachings of Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo,
 provides an introduction to the basic outlines of his thought and the method
 of meditation he taught.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first excerpt, from The Craft of the Heart, was written shortly after
 he had received training from Phra Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto.
 In it, Ajaan Lee shows how he regarded the state of meditation practice
 in Thailand at the time, and gives some ideas of why he himself had chosen
 the path of becoming a meditating monk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The passage from Keeping the Breath in Mind details the method of meditation
 he developed and taught in the later years of his life.
 The passage from The Path to Peace and Freedom for the Mind elaborates
 on a theme he had learned from Ajaan Mun: that there are no sharp boundaries
 among the practice of virtue, concentration, and discernment, and that
 all three of these aspects of the path are mutually reinforcing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three excerpts from Dhamma talks make a similar point: that there is
 no sharp division between the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight
 meditation.
 They also emphasize the role played by experimenting and using one's powers
 of observation in developing meditation as a skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The excerpts from Frames of Reference and Basic Themes deal with the development
 of discernment, particularly with regard to detecting the currents of the
 mind — both those that flow out and get involved with the world, and those
 that spin around with reference to the mind in the present — so as to touch
 the aspect of the mind that doesn't flow, even to the present moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next excerpt, from the concluding section of The Craft of the Heart,
 discusses the goal of the practice as a supreme awareness, beyond all suppositi
ons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final excerpt, from Ajaan Lee's Autobiography, discusses some of the
 lessons he learned by living in the forest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My hope is that this anthology will inspire the reader to further explore
 Ajaan Lee's teachings — both through reading more of his writings and through
 putting their teachings into practice.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I first became aware of the conflicting views held by people who practice
 — and of how ill-informed they are — I felt inspired by their desire to
 learn the truth, but at the same time dismayed over their views: right
 mixed with wrong, some people saying that nibbana and the paths leading
 to it still exist, others maintaining that nibbana has passed away and
 can no longer be attained.
 This latter belief is a particular cause for dismay, because a desire for
 nibbana is what has led us all to submit ourselves to the practice of the
 Buddha's teachings in the first place.
 If we don't have such a desire, we aren't likely to be especially sincere
 in our practice; and if we aren't sincere, our practice will be in vain
 as far as the benefits the Buddha intended for us are concerned, because
 the Buddha's sole purpose in teaching was to liberate living beings from
 suffering and stress.
 If we were to worm our way in as parasites on his religion, it would run
 counter to his compassionate intentions toward us.
 Each and every one of us aims for what is good, so we should pay heed to
 whatever factors may lead to release from suffering and stress.
 Don't let the Buddha's teaching pass by you in vain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By and large, from what I've seen of people who practice, a great many of
 them train themselves in ways that mix right with wrong, and then set themselve
s up as teachers, instructing their pupils in line with their various theories
 about jhana, concentration, nibbana, and the stream leading to it.
 The lowest level are those who get so caught up with their own views and
 opinions that their teachings can become detrimental — saying, for example,
 that we don't have enough merit to practice, that we've been born too late
 for nibbana and the paths leading to it, and so have to give up our practice.
 (Opinions of this sort run the gamut from crude to middling to subtle.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But no matter what level a person may know, if he doesn't know the hearts
 and minds of others, he'll have great difficulty in making his teachings
 effective and beneficial.
 Even though he may have good intentions, if he lacks knowledge of those
 he is teaching, progress will be difficult.
 The Buddha, whenever he taught, knew the capabilities and dispositions
 of his listeners, and the level of teaching for which they were ripe.
 He then tailored his teachings to suit their condition, which was why he
 was able to get good results.
 Even though he had a lot of seed to sow, he planted it only where he knew
 it would sprout.
 If he saw that the soil was barren or the climate harsh, he wouldn't plant
 any seed at all.
 But as for us, we have only a fistful of rice and yet we cast it along
 a mountain spine or in the belly of the sea, and so get either meager results
 or none at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus in this book I have included teachings on every level — elementary,
 intermediate, and advanced — leaving it up to the reader to pick out the
 teachings intended for his or her own level of attainment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practicing meditation, if you direct your mind along the right path,
 you'll see results in the immediate present.
 At the same time, if you lead yourself astray, you'll reap harm in the
 immediate present as well.
 For the most part, if meditators lack the training that comes from associating
 with those who are truly expert and experienced, they can become deluded
 or schizoid in a variety of ways.
 How so? By letting themselves get carried away with the signs or visions
 that appear to them, to the point where they lose sense of their own bodies
 and minds.
 Playing around with an external kasina is a special culprit in this regard.
 Those who lack sufficient training will tend to hallucinate, convinced
 of the truth of whatever they focus on, letting themselves get carried
 away by what they know and see until they lose touch with reality, making
 it difficult for any sort of discernment to arise.
 For this reason, in this guide I have taught to focus exclusively on the
 body and mind, the important point being not to fasten on or become obsessed
 with whatever may appear in the course of your practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a wide variety of meditation teachers who deviate from the basic
 principles taught by the Buddha.
 Some of them, hoping for gain, status, or praise, set up their own creeds
 with magical formulae and strict observances, teaching their students to
 invoke the aid of the Buddha.
 (Our Lord Buddha isn't a god of any sort who is going to come to our aid.
 Rather, we have to develop ourselves so as to reach his level.) Some teachers
 invoke the five forms of rapture, or else visions of this or that color
 or shape.
 If you see such and such vision, you attain the first level of the path,
 and so on until you attain the second, third, and fourth levels, and then
 once a year you present your teacher with offerings of rice, fruit, and
 a pig's head.
 (The Buddha's purpose in spreading his teachings was not that we would
 propitiate him with offerings.
 He was beyond the sway of material objects of any sort whatsoever.) Once
 the pupils of such teachers come to the end of their observances, they
 run out of levels to attain, and so can assume themselves to be Buddhas,
 Private Buddhas or Noble Disciples, and thus they become instant arahants.
 Their ears prick up, their hair stands on end, and they get excited all
 out of proportion to any basis in reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you study with some teachers, you have to start out with an offering
 of five candles and incense sticks, or maybe ten, plus so-and-so many flowers
 and so-and-so much puffed rice, on this or that day of the week, at this
 or that time of day, depending on the teacher's preferences.
 (If you can afford it, there's nothing really wrong with this, but it means
 that poor people or people with little free time will have trouble getting
 to learn how to meditate.) Once you finish the ceremony, the teacher tells
 you to meditate araham, araham, or buddho, buddho, until you get the vision
 he teaches you to look for — such as white, blue, red, yellow, a corpse,
 water, fire, a person, the Buddha, a Noble Disciple, heaven, hell — and
 then you start making assumptions that follow the drift of the objects
 you see.
 You jump to the conclusion that you've seen something special or have attained
 nibbana.
 Sometimes the mind gathers to the point where you sit still, in a daze,
 with no sense of self-awareness at all.
 Or else pleasure arises and you become attached to the pleasure, or stillness
 arises and you become attached to the stillness, or a vision or a color
 arises and you become attached to that.
 (All of these things are nothing more than uggaha nimitta.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps a thought arises and you think that it's insight, and then you really
 get carried away.
 You may decide that you're a stream-winner, a once-returner, or an arahant,
 and no one in the world can match you.
 You latch onto your views as correct in every way, giving rise to pride
 and conceit.
 (All of the things mentioned here, if you get attached to them, are wrong.)
 When this happens, liberating insight won't have a chance to arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So you have to keep digging away for decades — and then get fixated on the
 fact that you've been practicing a full twenty years, and so won't stand
 for it if anyone comes along and thinks he's better than you.
 So, out of fear that others will look down on you, you become even more
 stubborn and proud, and that's as far as your knowledge and ingenuity will
 get you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it comes to actual attainment, some people of this sort haven't even
 brought the Triple Gem into their hearts.
 Of course, there are probably many people who know better than this.
 I don't mean to cast aspersions on those who know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, I have drawn up this book in line with what I have studied
 and practiced, If you see that this might be the path you are looking for,
 give it a good look.
 My teacher didn't teach like the examples mentioned above.
 He taught in line with what was readily available, without requiring that
 you had to offer five incense sticks or ten candles or a pig's head or
 puffed rice or flowers or whatever.
 All he asked was that you have conviction in the Buddha and a willingness
 to practice his teachings.
 If you wanted to make an offering, some candles and incense as an offering
 to the Triple Gem would do — one candle if you had one, two if you had
 two; if you didn't have any, you could dedicate your life instead.
 Then he would have you repeat the formula for taking refuge in the Triple
 Gem as in the method given in this book.
 His approach to teaching in this way has always struck me as conducive
 to the practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have been practicing for a number of years now, and what I have observed
 all along has led me to have a sense of pity, both for myself and for my
 fellow human beings.
 If we practice along the right lines, we may very likely attain the benefits
 we hope for quickly.
 We'll gain knowledge that will make us marvel at the good that comes from
 the practice of meditation, or we may even see the paths and fruitions
 leading to nibbana in this present life — because nibbana is always present.
 It lacks only the people who will uncover it within themselves.
 Some people don't know how; others know, but aren't interested — and have
 mistaken assumptions about it to boot: thinking, for example, that nibbana
 is extinct, doesn't exist, can't be attained, is beyond the powers of people
 in the present day; saying that since we aren't Noble Disciples, how could
 we possibly attain it.
 This last is especially deluded.
 If we were already good, already Noble Disciples, what purpose would we
 have in going around trying to attain nibbana?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we don't despise the Buddha's teachings, then we can all practice them.
 But the truth of the matter is that though we worship the Dhamma, we don't
 practice the Dhamma, which is the same as despising it.
 If we feel well-enough situated in the present, we may tell ourselves that
 we can wait to practice the Dhamma in our next lifetime, or at least anytime
 by right now.
 Or we may take our defilements as an excuse, saying that we'll have to
 abandon greed, anger, and delusion before we can practice the Buddha's
 teachings.
 Or else we take our work as an excuse, saying that we'll have to stop working
 first.
 Actually, there's no reason that meditation should get in the way of our
 work, because it's strictly an activity of the heart.
 There's no need to dismantle our homes or abandon our belongings before
 practicing it; and if we did throw away our belongings in this way, it
 would probably end up causing harm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though it's true that we love ourselves, yet if we don't work for our
 own benefit, if we vacillate and hesitate, loading ourselves down with
 ballast and bricks, we make our days and nights go to waste.
 So we should develop and perfect the factors that bring about the paths
 and fruitions leading to nibbana.
 If you're interested, then examine the procedures explained in the following
 sections.
 Pick out whichever section seems to correspond to your own level and abilities,
 and take that as your guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for myself, I was first attracted to the Buddha's teachings by his statement
 that to lay claim to physical and mental phenomena as our own is suffering.
 After considering his teaching that the body is anatta — not-self — I began
 to be struck by a sense of dismay over the nature of the body.
 I examined it to see in what way it was not-self, and — as far as my understand
ing allowed — the Buddha's teaching began to make very clear sense to me.
 I considered how the body arises, is sustained and passes away, and I came
 to the conclusion that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) it arises from upadana — clinging through mistaken assumptions — which
 forms the essence of kamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) It is sustained by nourishment provided by our parents; and since our
 parents have nothing of their own with which to nourish us, they have to
 search for food — two-footed animals, four-footed animals, animals in the
 water, and animals on land — either buying this food or else killing it
 on their own and then feeding it to us.
 The animals abused in this way are bound to curse and seek revenge against
 those who kill and eat them, just as we are possessive of our belongings
 and seek revenge against those who rob us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who don't know the truth of the body take it to be the self, but after
 considering the diseases we suffer in our eyes, nose, mouth, and throughout
 the various parts of the body, I concluded that we've probably been cursed
 by the animals we've eaten, because all of these parts come from the food
 we've made of their bodies.
 And so our body, cursed in this way, suffers pain with no recourse for
 begging mercy.
 Thus, victim to the spirits of these animals, we suffer pains in the eyes,
 pains in the ears, pains in the nose and mouth and throughout the body,
 until in the end we have to relinquish the whole thing so they can eat
 it all up.
 Even while we're still living, some of them — like mosquitoes and sandflies
 — come and try to take it by force.
 If we don't let go of our attachments to the body, we're bound to suffer
 for many lives to come.
 This is one reason why I felt attracted to the Buddha's teachings on not-self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) The body passes away from being denied nourishment.
 The fact that this happens to us is without a doubt a result of our past
 actions.
 We've probably been harsh with other living beings, denying them food to
 the point where they've had to part with the bodies they feel such affection
 for.
 When the results of such actions bear fruit, our bodies will have to break
 up and disband in the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering things in this manner caused me to feel even more attracted
 to the practical methods recommended by the Buddha for seeing not-self
 and letting go of our clinging assumptions so that we no longer have to
 be possessive of the treasures claimed by ignorant and fixated animals.
 If we persist in holding onto the body as our own, it's the same as cheating
 others of their belongings, turning them into our own flesh and blood and
 then, forgetting where these things came from, latching onto them as our
 very own.
 When this happens, we're like a child who, born in one family and then
 taken and raised in another family with a different language, is sure to
 forget his original language and family name.
 If someone comes along and calls him by his original name, he most likely
 won't stand for it, because of his ignorance of his own origins.
 So it is with the body: Once it has grown, we latch onto it, assuming it
 to be the self.
 We forget its origins and so become drugged, addicted to physical and mental
 phenomena, enduring pain for countless lifetimes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These thoughts are what led me to start practicing the teachings of the
 Buddha so as to liberate myself from this mass of suffering and stress.

\begin_layout Standard
From Keeping the Breath in Mind: Method 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are seven basic steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Start out with three or seven long in-and-out breaths, thinking bud- with
 the in-breath, and dho with the out.
 Keep the meditation syllable as long as the breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Be clearly aware of each in-and-out breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Observe the breath as it goes in and out, noticing whether it's comfortable
 or uncomfortable, broad or narrow, obstructed or free-flowing, fast or
 slow, short or long, warm or cool.
 If the breath doesn't feel comfortable, change it until it does.
 For instance, if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable, try breathing
 in short and out short.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as you find that your breathing feels comfortable, let this comfortable
 breath sensation spread to the different parts of the body.
 To begin with, inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull, and
 let it flow all the way down the spine.
 Then, if you are male, let it spread down your right leg to the sole of
 your foot, to the ends of your toes, and out into the air.
 Inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull again and let it spread
 down your spine, down your left leg to the ends of your toes and out into
 the air.
 (If you are female, begin with the left side first, because the male and
 female nervous systems are different.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both shoulders,
 past your elbows and wrists, to the tips of your fingers and out into the
 air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central nerve at
 the front of the body, past the lungs and liver, all the way down to the
 bladder and colon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the
 way down to your intestines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let all these breath sensations spread so that they connect and flow together,
 and you'll feel a greatly improved sense of well-being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Learn four ways of adjusting the breath:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 in long and out long, b.
 in long and out short, c.
 in short and out long, d.
 in short and out short.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Breathe whichever way is most comfortable for you.
 Or, better yet, learn to breathe comfortably all four ways, because your
 physical condition and your breath are always changing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Become acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind — the resting
 spots of the breath — and center your awareness on whichever one seems
 most comfortable.
 A few of these bases are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 the tip of the nose, b.
 the middle of the head, c.
 the palate, d.
 the base of the throat, e.
 the breastbone (the tip of the sternum), f.
 the navel (or a point just above it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems, don't focus on
 any spot above the base of the throat.
 And don't try to force the breath or put yourself into a trance.
 Breathe freely and naturally.
 Let the mind be at ease with the breath — but not to the point where it
 slips away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Spread your awareness — your sense of conscious feeling — throughout the
 entire body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Unite the breath sensations throughout the body, letting them flow together
 comfortably, keeping your awareness as broad as possible.
 Once you are fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know
 in your body, you'll come to know all sorts of other aspects as well.
 The breath, by its nature, has many facets: breath sensations flowing in
 the nerves, those flowing around and about the nerves, those spreading
 from the nerves to every pore.
 Beneficial breath sensations and harmful ones are mixed together by their
 very nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize: (a) for the sake of improving the energy already existing
 in every part of your body, so that you can contend with such things as
 disease and pain; and (b) for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already
 within you, so that it can become a basis for the skills leading to release
 and purity of heart — you should always bear these seven steps in mind,
 because they are absolutely basic to every aspect of breath meditation.
 When you've mastered them, you will have cut a main road.
 As for the side roads — the incidentals of breath meditation — there are
 plenty of them, but they aren't really important.
 You'll be perfectly safe if you stick to these seven steps and practice
 them as much as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we will summarize the methods of breath meditation under the headings
 of jhana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jhana means to be absorbed or focused in a single object or preoccupation,
 as when we deal with the breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The first jhana has five factors: (a) Directed thought (vitakka): Think
 of the breath until you can recognize it clearly without getting distracted.
 (b) Singleness of object (ekaggatarammana): Keep the mind with the breath.
 Don't let it stray after other objects.
 Watch over your thoughts so that they deal only with the breath to the
 point where the breath becomes comfortable.
 (The mind becomes one, at rest with the breath.) (c) Evaluation (vicara):
 Gain a sense of how to let this comfortable breath sensation spread and
 co-ordinate with the other breath sensations in the body.
 Let these breath sensations spread until they all merge.
 Once the body has been soothed by the breath, feelings of pain will grow
 calm.
 The body will be filled with good breath energy.
 (The mind is focused exclusively on issues connected with the breath.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These three qualities must be brought together to bear on the same stream
 of breathing for the first jhana to arise.
 This stream of breathing can then take you all the way to the fourth jhana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Directed thought, singleness of object and evaluation act as the causes.
 When the causes are fully ripe, results will appear — (d) rapture (piti):
 a compelling sense of fullness and refreshment for body and mind, going
 straight to the heart, independent of all else.
 (e) Pleasure (sukha): physical ease arising from the body's being still
 and unperturbed (kaya-passaddhi); mental contentment arising from the mind's
 being at ease on its own, unperturbed, serene and exultant (citta-passaddhi).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rapture and pleasure are the results.
 The factors of the first jhana thus come down simply to two sorts: causes
 and results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As rapture and pleasure grow stronger, the breath becomes more subtle.
 The longer you stay focused and absorbed, the more powerful the results
 become.
 This enables you to set directed thought and evaluation (the preliminary
 ground-clearing) aside, and — relying completely on a single factor, singleness
 of object — you enter the second jhana (magga-citta, phala-citta).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The second jhana has three factors: rapture, pleasure and singleness of
 object (magga-citta).
 This refers to the state of mind that has tasted the results coming from
 the first jhana.
 Once you have entered the second level, rapture and pleasure become stronger
 because they rely on a single cause, singleness of object, which looks
 after the work from here on in: focusing on the breath so that it becomes
 more and more refined, keeping steady and still with a sense of refreshment
 and ease for both body and mind.
 The mind is even more stable and intent than before.
 As you continue focusing, rapture and pleasure become stronger and begin
 to expand and contract.
 Continue focusing on the breath, moving the mind deeper to a more subtle
 level to escape the motions of rapture and pleasure, and you enter the
 third jhana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 The third jhana has two factors: pleasure and singleness of object.
 The body is quiet, motionless and solitary.
 No feelings of pain arise to disturb it.
 The mind is solitary and still.
 The breath is refined, free-flowing and broad.
 A radiance — white like cotton wool — pervades the entire body, stilling
 all feelings of physical and mental discomfort.
 Keep focused on looking after nothing but the broad, refined breath.
 The mind is free: No thoughts of past or future disturb it.
 The mind stands out on its own.
 The four properties — earth, water, fire and wind — are in harmony throughout
 the body.
 You could almost say that they're pure throughout the entire body, because
 the breath has the strength to control and take good care of the other
 properties, keeping them harmonious and coordinated.
 Mindfulness is coupled with singleness of object, which acts as the cause.
 The breath fills the body.
 Mindfulness fills the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Focus on in: The mind is bright and powerful, the body is light.
 Feelings of pleasure are still.
 Your sense of the body feels steady and even, with no slips or gaps in
 your awareness, so you can let go of your sense of pleasure.
 The manifestations of pleasure grow still, because the four properties
 are balanced and free from motion.
 Singleness of object, the cause, has the strength to focus more heavily
 down, taking you to the fourth jhana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 The fourth jhana has two factors: equanimity (upekkha) and singleness of
 object, or mindfulness.
 Equanimity and singleness of object on the fourth jhana are powerfully
 focused — solid, stable and sure.
 The breath element is absolutely quiet, free from ripples and gaps.
 The mind, neutral and still, lets go of all preoccupations with past and
 future.
 The breath, which forms the present, is still, like the ocean or air when
 they are free from currents or waves.
 You can know distant sights, and sounds, because the breath is even and
 unwavering, and so acts like a movie screen, giving a clear reflection
 of whatever is projected onto it.
 Knowledge arises in the mind: You know but stay neutral and still.
 The mind is neutral and still; the breath, neutral and still; past, present
 and future are all neutral and still.
 This is true singleness of object, focused on the unperturbed stillness
 of the breath.
 All parts of the breath in the body connect so that you can breathe through
 every pore.
 You don't have to breathe through the nostrils, because the in-and-out
 breath and the other aspects of the breath in the body form a single, unified
 whole.
 All aspects of the breath energy are even and full.
 The four properties all have the same characteristics.
 The mind is completely still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The focus is strong; the light, aglow.
 This is to know the great frame of reference.
 The mind is beaming and bright — like the light of the sun, which unobstructed
 by clouds or haze, illumines the earth with its rays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind sheds light in all directions.
 The breath is radiant, the mind fully radiant, due to the focusing of mindfulne
ss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The focus is strong; the light, aglow...
 The mind has power and authority.
 All four of the frames of reference are gathered into one.
 There is no sense that, 'That's the body...
 That's a feeling...
 That's the mind...
 That's a mental quality.' There's no sense that they're four, This is thus
 called the great frame of reference, because none of the four are in any
 way separate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind is firmly intent, centered and true, due to the strength of its
 focus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness and alertness converge into one: This is what is meant by the
 one path (ekayana-magga) — the concord among the properties and frames
 of reference, four in one, giving rise to great energy and wakefulness,
 the purifying inner fire (tapas) that can thoroughly dispel all obscuring
 darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you focus more strongly on the radiance of the mind, the power that comes
 from letting go of all preoccupations enables the mind to stand alone.
 You're like a person who has climbed to the top of a mountain and has the
 right to see in all directions.
 The mind's dwelling — the breath, which supports the mind's freedom — is
 in a heightened state, so the mind is able to see all things fashioned
 (sankhara) clearly in terms of the Dhamma: as properties (dhatu),khandhas,
 and sense media (ayatana).
 Just as a person who has taken a camera up in an airplane can take pictures
 of practically everything below, so a person who has reached this stage
 (lokavidu) can see the world and the Dhamma as they truly are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, awareness of another sort, in the area of the mind — called
 liberating insight, or the skill of release — also appears.
 The elements or properties of the body acquire potency (kaya-siddhi); the
 mind, resilient power.
 When you want knowledge of the world or the Dhamma, focus the mind heavily
 and forcefully on the breath.
 As the concentrated power of the mind strikes the pure element, intuitive
 knowledge will spring up in that element, just as the needle of a record
 player, as it strikes a record, will give rise to sounds.
 Once your mindfulness is focused on a pure object, then if you want images,
 images will appear; if sounds, sounds will arise, whether near or far,
 matters of the world or the Dhamma, concerning yourself or others, past,
 present or future — whatever you want to know.
 As you focus down, think of what you want to know, and it will appear.
 This is ñana — intuitive sensitivity capable of knowing past, present and
 future — an important level of awareness that you can know only for yourself.
 The elements are like radio waves going through the air.
 If your mind and mindfulness are strong, and your skills highly developed,
 you can use those elements to put yourself in touch with the entire world,
 so that knowledge can arise within you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you have mastered the fourth jhana, it can act as the basis for eight
 skills:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Vipassana-ñana: clear intuitive insight into mental and physical phenomena
 as they arise, remain and disband.
 This is a special sort of insight, coming solely from training the mind.
 It can occur in two ways: (a) knowing without ever having thought of the
 matter; and (b) knowing from having thought of the matter — but not after
 a great deal of thought, as in the case of ordinary knowledge.
 Think for an instant and it immediately becomes clear — just as a piece
 of cotton wool soaked in gasoline, when you hold a match to it, bursts
 immediately into flame.
 The intuition and insight here are that fast, and so differ from ordinary
 discernment.
 2.
 Manomayiddhi: the ability to use the mind to influence events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Iddhividhi: the ability to display supra-normal powers, e.g., creating images
 in certain instances that certain groups of people will be able to see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Dibbasota: the ability to hear distant sounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Cetopariya-ñana: the ability to know the level — good or evil, high or
 low — of other people's minds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Pubbenivasanussati-ñana: the ability to remember previous lifetimes.
 (If you attain this skill, you'll no longer have to wonder as to whether
 death is followed by annihilation or rebirth.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Dibbacakkhu: the ability to see gross and subtle images, both near and
 far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 Asavakkhaya-ñana: the ability to reduce and eliminate the effluents of
 defilement in the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These eight skills come exclusively from the centering the mind, which is
 why I have written this condensed guide to concentration and jhana, based
 on the technique of keeping the breath in mind.
 If you aspire to the good that can come from these things, you should turn
 your attention to training your own heart and mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From The Path to Peace & Freedom for the Mind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three levels of virtue —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Hetthima-sila: normalcy of word and deed, which consists of three kinds
 of bodily acts — not killing, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct;
 and four kinds of speech — not lying, not speaking divisively, not saying
 anything coarse or abusive, not speaking idly.
 If we class virtue on this level according to the wording of the precepts
 and the groups of people who observe them, there are four — the five precepts,
 the eight, the ten, and the 227 precepts.
 All of these deal with aspects of behavior that should be abandoned, termed
 pahana-kicca.
 At the same time, the Buddha directed us to develop good manners and proper
 conduct in the use of the four necessities of life — food, clothing, shelter,
 and medicine — so that our conduct in terms of thought, word, and deed
 will be orderly and becoming.
 This aspect is termed bhavana-kicca, behavior we should work at developing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observance of these precepts or rules — dealing merely with words and deeds
 — forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue, which is what makes us
 into full-fledged human beings (manussa-sampatti).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Majjhima-sila: the medium level of virtue, i.e., keeping watch over your
 words and deeds so that they cause no harm; and, in addition, keeping watch
 over your thoughts so as to keep them upright in three ways —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 Anabhijjha-visamalobha: not coveting things that do not belong to you and
 that lie beyond your scope or powers; not focusing your thoughts on such
 things; not building what are called castles in the air.
 The Buddha taught us to tend to the wealth we already have so that it can
 grow on its own.
 The wealth we already have, if we use our intelligence and ingenuity, will
 draw more wealth our way without our having to waste time and energy by
 being covetous or greedy.
 For example, suppose we have a single banana tree: If we water it, give
 it fertilizer, loosen the soil around its roots, and guard it in other
 ways, our single banana tree will eventually give rise to an increase of
 other banana trees.
 In other words, if we're shrewd we can turn whatever wealth we have into
 a basis for a livelihood.
 But if we lack intelligence — if our hearts simply want to get, without
 wanting work — then even if we acquire a great deal of wealth, we won't
 be able to support ourselves.
 Thus, greed of this sort, in which we focus our desires above and beyond
 our capacities, is classed as a wrong kind of mental action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.
 Abyapada: abandoning thoughts of ill will, hatred, and vengeance, and developin
g thoughts of benevolence and good will instead; thinking of the good aspects
 of the people who have angered us.
 When people make us angry, it comes from the fact that our dealings with
 them — in which we associate with and assist one another — sometimes lead
 to disappointment.
 This gives rise to dislike and irritation, which in turn cause us to brood,
 so that we develop hurt feelings that grow into anger and thoughts of retaliati
on.
 Thus we should regard such people from many angles, for ordinarily as human
 beings they should have some good to them.
 If they don't act well toward us, they may at least speak well to us.
 Or if they don't act or speak well to us, perhaps their thoughts may be
 well-meaning to at least some extent.
 Thus, when you find your thoughts heading in the direction of anger or
 dislike, you should sit down and think in two ways —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Try to think of whatever ways that person has been good to you.
 When these things come to mind, they'll give rise to feelings of affection,
 love, and good will.
 This is one way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Anger is something worthless, like the scum that floats on the surface
 of a lake.
 If we're stupid, we won't get to drink the clean water that lies underneath;
 or if we drink the scum, we may catch a disease.
 A person who is bad to you is like someone sunk in filth.
 If you're stupid enough to hate or be angry with such people, it's as if
 you wanted to go sit in the filth with them.
 Is that what you want? Think about this until any thoughts of ill will
 and anger disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.
 Samma-ditthi: abandoning wrong views and mental darkness.
 If our minds lack the proper training and education, we may come to think
 that we and all other living beings are born simply as accidents of nature;
 that 'father' and 'mother' have no special meaning; that good and evil
 don't exist.
 Such views deviate from the truth.
 They can dissuade us from restraining the evil that lies within us and
 from searching for and fostering the good.
 To believe that there's no good or evil, that death is annihilation, is
 Wrong View — a product of faulty thinking and poor discernment, seeing
 things for what they aren't.
 So we should abandon such views and educate ourselves, searching for knowledge
 of the Dhamma and associating with people wiser than we, so that they can
 show us the proper path.
 We'll then be able to reform our views and make them Right, which is one
 form of mental uprightness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtue on this level, when we can maintain it well, will qualify us to be
 heavenly beings.
 The qualities of heavenly beings, which grow out of human values, will
 turn us into human beings who are divine in our virtues, for to guard our
 thoughts, words, and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetime.
 This is one aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the
 middle level of virtue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Uparima-sila: higher virtue, where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the
 area of mental activity.
 There are two sides to higher virtue —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 PAHANA-KICCA: qualities to be abandoned, which are of five sorts —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Kamachanda: affection, desire, laxity, infatuation.
 (2) Byapada: ill will and hatred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Thina-middha: discouragement, drowsiness, sloth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Uddhacca-kukkucca: restlessness and anxiety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) Vicikiccha: doubt, uncertainty, indecision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Ill will (byapada) lies at the essence of killing (panatipata), for
 it causes us to destroy our own goodness and that of others — and when
 our mind can kill off our own goodness, what's to keep us from killing
 other people and animals as well?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Restlessness (uddhacca) lies at the essence of taking what is not given
 (adinnadana).
 The mind wanders about, taking hold of other people's affairs, sometimes
 their good points, sometimes their bad.
 To fasten onto their good points isn't too serious, for it can give us
 at least some nourishment.
 As long as we're going to steal other people's business and make it our
 own, we might as well take their silver and gold.
 Their bad points, though, are like trash they've thrown away — scraps and
 bones, with nothing of any substance — and yet even so we let the mind
 feed on them.
 When we know that other people are possessive of their bad points and guard
 them well, and yet we still take hold of these things to think about, it
 should be classed as a form of taking what isn't given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Sensual desires (kamachanda) lie at the essence of sensual misconduct.
 The mind feels an attraction for sensual objects — thoughts of past or
 future sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations — or for sensual
 defilements — passion, aversion, or delusion — to the point where we forget
 ourselves.
 Mental states such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety
 in sensual matters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Doubt (vicikiccha) lies at the essence of lying.
 In other words, our minds are unsure, with nothing reliable or true to
 them.
 We have no firm principles and so drift along under the influence of all
 kinds of thoughts and preoccupations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) Drowsiness (thina-middha) is intoxication — discouragement, dullness,
 forgetfulness, with no mindfulness or restraint watching over the mind.
 This is what it means to be drugged or drunk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these unwise qualities are things we should eliminate by training
 the heart along the lines of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.
 BHAVANA-KICCA: qualities to be developed —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Mindfulness (sati): Start out by thinking of an object, such as your
 in-and-out breathing.
 Use mindfulness to steady the mind in its object.
 Vitakka, thinking in this way, is what kills off sensual desires, in that
 the discipline of mindfulness keeps the mind from slipping off into external
 objects.
 (2) Vicara: Evaluate and be observant.
 Make yourself aware of whether or not you've received a sense of comfort
 and relaxation from your breathing.
 If not, tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of ways: e.g., in long
 and out long, in long and out short, in short and out short, in short and
 out long, in slow and out slow, in fast and out fast, in gently and out
 gently, in strong and out strong, in throughout the body and out throughout
 the body.
 Adjust the breath until it gives good results to both body and mind, and
 you'll be able to kill off feelings of ill will and hatred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Piti: When you get good results — for instance, when the subtle breath
 sensations in the body merge and flow together, permeating the entire sense
 of the body — the breath is like an electric wire; the various parts of
 the body, such as the bones, are like electricity poles; mindfulness and
 self-awareness are like a power source; and awareness is thus bright and
 radiant.
 Both body and mind feel full and satisfied.
 This is piti, or rapture, which can kill off feelings of drowsiness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Sukha: Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared,
 a sense of pleasure and ease for body and mind arises.
 This pleasure is what kills off restlessness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) Ekaggata: Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distance.
 The mind reaches oneness of object in a state of normalcy and equilibrium.
 This normalcy of mind, which is maintained through the power of the discipline
 of mindfulness (sati-vinaya), forms the essence of virtue: firmness, steadiness
, stability.
 And the resulting flavor or nourishment of virtue is tranquillity, light-hearte
dness, and a sense of independence for the mind.
 When freedom of this sort arises within us, this is called the development
 of silanussati, the mindfulness of virtue.
 This is virtue that attains excellence — leading to the paths, their fruitions,
 and nibbana — and thus can be called uparima-sila, higher virtue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, there are three levels of virtue: external virtue, intermediate
 virtue, and internal virtue.
 In ultimate terms, however, there are two —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Mundane virtue: virtue connected with the world, in which we maintain the
 principles of ordinary human morality but are as yet unable to reach the
 transcendent levels: stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantsh
ip.
 We can't yet cut the Fetters (sanyojana) that tie the heart to the influences
 of all the worlds.
 This is thus called mundane virtue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Transcendent virtue: virtue that's constant and sure, going straight to
 the heart, bathing the heart with its nourishment.
 This arises from the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight meditation.
 tranquillity meditation forms the cause, and insight meditation the result:
 discovering the true nature of the properties, aggregates (khandhas), and
 senses; seeing clearly the four Noble Truths, in proportion to our practice
 of the Path, and abandoning the first three of the Fetters —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 Sakkaya-ditthi (self-identity views): views that see the body or the aggregates
 as part of the self or as belonging to the self.
 Ordinarily, we may be convinced that views of this sort are mistaken, yet
 we can't really abandon them.
 But when we clearly see that they're wrong for sure, this is called Right
 View — seeing things as they truly are — which can eliminate such wrong
 views as seeing the body as belonging to the self, or the self as the five
 aggregates, or the five aggregates as part of the self.
 b.
 Vicikiccha: doubt concerning what's genuine and true, and what's counterfeit
 and false.
 The power of Right View enables us to see that the quality to which we
 awaken exists at all times; and that the true qualities that cause us to
 awaken also exist and are made effective through the power of the practices
 we're following.
 Our knowledge is definite and true.
 Our doubts concerning the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha are
 cleared up for good.
 This is called becoming a niyata-puggala, a person who is certain and sure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.
 Silabbata-paramasa: When the heart abandons this Fetter, it no longer dotes
 on theories concerning moral virtue; it's no longer stuck merely on the
 level of manners and actions.
 Good and evil are accomplished through the heart; activities and actions
 are something separate.
 Even though people who reach this level do good — taking the precepts,
 making gifts and offerings, or meditating in line with the good customs
 of the world — they're not caught up on any of these things, because their
 hearts have reached the nourishment of virtue.
 They aren't stuck on the particulars (byañjana), i.e., their actions and
 activities; nor are they stuck on the purpose (attha), i.e., the meaning
 or intent of their various good manners.
 Their hearts dwell in the nourishment of virtue: tranquillity, stability,
 normalcy of mind.
 Just as a person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating
 his body isn't stuck on either the food or its flavor — because he's received
 the benefits of the nourishment it provides — in the same way, the hearts
 of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on
 actions or manners, particulars or purposes, because they've tasted virtue's
 nourishment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is thus classed as transcendent virtue, the first stage of nibbana.
 Even though such people may be destined for further rebirth, they're apart
 from the ordinary.
 Anyone whose practice reaches this level can be counted as fortunate, as
 having received dependable wealth, like ingots of gold.
 Just as gold can be used as currency all over the world because it has
 special value for all human beings — unlike paper currency, whose use is
 limited to specific countries — in the same way, a heart that's truly attained
 virtue has a value in this life that will remain constant in lives to come.
 Thus, a person who has reached this level has received part of the Noble
 Wealth of those who practice the religion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concentration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concentration has three levels —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Kamavacara-khanika-samadhi: (momentary concentration in the sensory realm):
 The mind keeps thinking, coming to rest, and running along after worthwhile
 preoccupations — either internal or external — on the sensory level (kamavacara
-kusala): sights, sounds, smells, flavors, tactile sensations, or ideas.
 An example of this is when the mind becomes quiet and rested for a moment
 as we sit listening to a sermon or chanting.
 In other words, the mind grows still for momentary periods in the same
 way that a person walks: One foot takes a step while the other foot rests
 on the ground, providing the energy needed to reach one's goal.
 This is thus called momentary concentration, something possessed by people
 all over the world.
 Whether or not we practice concentration, the mind is always behaving this
 way by its very nature.
 This is called the 'bhavanga-citta' or 'bhavanga-pada': The mind stops
 for a moment and then moves on.
 In developing higher levels of concentration, we have to start out with
 this ordinary level as our basis.
 Otherwise, the higher levels probably wouldn't be possible.
 Still, this level of concentration can't be used as a basis for discernment,
 which is why we have to go further in our practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Rupavacara-upacara-samadhi (threshold concentration in the realm of form):
 This refers to the first jhana, in which the mind comes inward to rest
 on a single preoccupation within the body, fixing its attention, for example,
 on the in-and-out breath.
 When the mind stays with its one object, this is called ekaggata.
 At the same time, there's mindfulness keeping the breath in mind: This
 is called vitakka.
 The mind then adjusts and expands the various aspects of the breath throughout
 the entire body, evaluating them mindfully with complete circumspection:
 This is called self-awareness (sampajañña) or vicara, which is the factor
 aware of causes and results.
 Mindfulness, the cause, is what does the work.
 Thus vitakka and vicara cooperate in focusing on the same topic.
 We are then aware of the results as they arise — feelings of fullness,
 pleasure, and ease (piti and sukha) for body and mind.
 At this point, the mind lets down its burdens to rest for a while, like
 a person walking along who meets with something pleasing and attractive,
 and so stops to look: Both feet are standing still, stepping neither forward
 nor back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we aren't skilled enough to go on any further, we will then retreat.
 If we see results — such as signs and visions — arising in the mind, we
 may get excited and so cause our original preoccupation to waver or fade.
 Like a person sitting on a chair: If he sees something appealing in front
 of him, he may become so interested that he leans forward and reaches out
 his hand; he may even begin to budge a bit from his seat or stand up completely.
 In the same way, if we get engrossed in visions, thoughts, or views when
 we're engaged in threshold concentration, we can become excited and pleased
 — we may even think that we've reached the transcendent — and this can
 cause our concentration to degenerate.
 If we try to do it again and can't, we may then seize the opportunity to
 say that we've gone beyond the practice of concentration, so that we can
 now take the way of discernment — thinking, pondering, and letting go in
 line with nothing more than our own views and ideas.
 This, though, is not likely to succeed, because our knowledge has no firm
 basis or core, like a wheel with no axle or hub: How can it get anywhere?
 The power of threshold concentration, if we don't watch after it well,
 is bound to deteriorate, and we'll be left with nothing but old, left-over
 concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Rupavacara-appana-samadhi (fixed penetration in the realm of form): This
 refers to the practice of all four levels of rupa jhana.
 The first jhana has five factors: thinking, evaluating, fullness, pleasure,
 and singleness of object.
 The second level has three: fullness, pleasure, and singleness of object.
 The third has two: pleasure and singleness of object; and the fourth has
 two: equanimity and singleness of object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixed penetration in the realm of form means that the mind focuses on the
 internal sense of the body, remaining steadily with a single object — such
 as the in-and-out breath — until it reaches jhana, beginning with the first
 level, which is composed of thinking, evaluating, fullness, pleasure, and
 singleness of object.
 When you see results arising, focus in on those results and they will then
 turn into the second level, which has three factors: fullness, pleasure
 and singleness of object.
 As your focus becomes stronger, it causes the sense of fullness to waver,
 so you can now let go of that sense of fullness, and your concentration
 turns into the third jhana, in which only two factors are left: pleasure
 and singleness of object.
 The mind has few burdens; its focus is strong and the sense of inner light
 is radiant.
 This causes the feeling of pleasure to waver, so that you can let go of
 that sense of pleasure, and the mind attains oneness in a very subtle preoccupa
tion.
 The preoccupation doesn't waver and neither does the mind.
 It stands firm in its freedom.
 This is called equanimity and singleness of object, which form the fourth
 jhana.
 Mindfulness is powerful.
 Self-awareness is complete.
 Both are centered on a single preoccupation without getting snagged on
 any other allusions or perceptions.
 This mental state is called the fourth jhana, which has two factors: Equanimity
, or stillness, is the external attitude of the mind; as for the real factors,
 they're mindfulness and singleness, steady and firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind experiences a sense of brightness, the radiance that comes from
 its state of fixed penetration.
 Mindfulness and self-awareness are circumspect and all-round, and so give
 rise to skill and proficiency in practicing jhana — in focusing, staying
 in place, stepping through the various levels, withdrawing, going back
 and forth.
 When the mind behaves as you want it to, no matter when you practice, only
 then does this truly qualify as fixed penetration, the basis for the arising
 of three qualities: intuitive knowledge (ñana), discernment (pañña), and
 cognitive skill (vijja).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitive knowledge here refers to knowledge or sensitivity of an extraordinary
 sort.
 For example —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pubbenivasanussati-ñana: the ability to remember previous lives.
 Cutupapata-ñana: the ability to focus on the death and rebirth of other
 living beings — sometimes in good destinations, sometimes in bad — together
 with the causes that lead them to be reborn in such ways.
 This gives rise to a sense of weariness and disenchantment with sensations
 and mental acts, body and mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asavakkhaya-ñana: knowing how to put an end to the defilements of the heart
 in accordance with the knowledge — the clear vision of the four Noble Truths
 — that accompanies the particular transcendent path reached.
 And there are still other forms of extraordinary knowledge, such as iddhividhi,
 the ability to display supernormal powers, to make an image of oneself
 appear to other people; dibbasota, clairaudience; dibbacakkhu, clairvoyance
 — i.e., the ability to see objects at tremendous distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment refers to discriminating knowledge, clear comprehension, knowledge
 in line with the truth.
 For example —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attha-patisambhida: acumen with regard to aims and results; thorough-going
 comprehension of cause and effect; knowing, for example, how stress is
 caused by ignorance and craving, and how the disbanding of stress is caused
 by the intuitive discernment that forms the Path; comprehending the meaning
 and aims of the Buddha's various teachings and knowing how to explain them
 so that other people will understand — being able, for instance, to summarize
 a long passage without distorting its meaning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dhamma-patisambhida: acumen with regard to mental qualities; knowing how
 to explain deep and subtle points so that other people will understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nirutti-patisambhida: acumen with regard to different languages.
 According to the texts, this includes knowing foreign languages and the
 languages of various other living beings by means of the eye of discernment
 (pañña cakkhu).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patibhana-patisambhida: acumen with regard to expression; being fluent in
 making explanations and quick-witted in debate; knowing the most strategic
 way to express things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these forms of discernment can arise from training the mind to attain
 fixed penetration.
 Vijja — clear, open knowledge, free from any further concealments; and
 aloka — brilliance, radiance streaming out in all directions — enable us
 to see the true nature of sensations and mental acts, in accordance with
 our powers of intuitive discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cognitive skill refers to clear, uncanny knowledge that arises from the
 mind's being firmly fixed in jhana.
 There are eight sorts —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Vipassana-ñana: clear comprehension of physical sensations and mental
 acts (rupa, nama).(2) Manomayiddhi: psychic powers, influencing events through
 the power of thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Iddhividhi: the ability to display powers, making one's body appear
 in a variety of ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Dibba-cakkhu: clairvoyance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) Dibba-sota: clairaudience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(6) Cetopariya-ñana: the ability to know the mental states of other people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(7) Pubbenivasanussati-ñana: the ability to remember previous lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(8) Asavakkhaya-ñana: the ability to put an end to the effluents that defile
 the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, jhana on the level of fixed penetration is extremely important.
 It can give us support on all sides — on the level of the world and of
 the Dhamma — and can bring success in our various activities, both in our
 worldly affairs and in our Dhamma duties, leading us on to the transcendent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, there are two kinds of concentration:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 That which gives rise to mundane knowledge: This is termed mundane concentratio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 That which helps us to fulfill our duties on the level of the Dhamma, leading
 to vipassana-ñana or asavakkhaya-ñana, the knowledge that enables us —
 in accordance with the discernment and insight that arise — to abandon
 or cut off completely the mental tendencies that lean in the direction
 of the Fetters: This is termed transcendent concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment is of three kinds —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Sutamaya-pañña: discernment that comes from studying.
 2.
 Cintamaya-pañña: discernment that comes from reflecting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Bhavanamaya-pañña: discernment that comes from developing the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
l.
 Sutamaya-pañña refers to the discernment that comes from having listened
 a great deal, like the Venerable Ananda.
 Listening here, though, includes studying and taking interest in a variety
 of ways: paying attention, taking notes, asking questions, and taking part
 in discussions so as to become quick-witted and astute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Education of all kinds comes down to two sorts: (a) learning the basic units,
 such as the letters of the alphabet, their sound and pronunciation, so
 as to understand their accepted usage; and (b) learning how to put them
 together — for instance, how to combine the letters so as to give rise
 to words and meanings — as when we complete our elementary education so
 that we won't be at a loss when we're called on to read and write in the
 course of making a living.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the area of the religion, we have to study the letters of the Pali alphabet,
 their combinations, their meanings, and their pronunciation.
 If we don't understand clearly, we should take an interest in asking questions.
 If we have trouble memorizing, we should take an interest in jotting down
 notes as a way of aiding our memory and expanding our concepts.
 In addition, we have to study by means of our senses.
 For example, when we see a visual object, we should find out its truth.
 When we hear sounds or words, we should find out their truth.
 When we smell an aroma, we should consider it to see what it comes from.
 We should take an interest in flavors so that we know what they come from,
 and in tactile sensations — the heat and cold that touch the body — by
 studying such things as the way weather behaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these forms of education are ways of giving rise to astuteness —
 both in the area of the world and in the area of the Dhamma — because they
 constitute a basic level of knowledge, like the primary education offered
 in schools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Cintamaya-pañña refers to thinking and evaluating so as to learn the meaning
 and truth of one's beginning education.
 This level of education draws out the meaning of the knowledge we have
 gained through studying.
 When we gain information, we should reflect on it until we understand it
 so that we will be led by our sense of reason and not by gullibility or
 ignorance.
 This is like a person who has used his knowledge of the alphabet to gain
 knowledge from books to complete his secondary education.
 Such a person has reached the level where he can think things through clearly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the area of the Dhamma, the same holds true.
 Once we have learned the basics, we should research and think through the
 content of the Teaching until we give rise to an understanding so that
 we can conduct ourselves correctly in line with the methods and aims taught
 by the sages of the past.
 This level of discernment is what prepares us to conduct ourselves properly
 in line with the true essence of the Doctrine and Discipline.
 This is classed as an aspect of pariyatti dhamma, Dhamma on the level of
 theory.
 By learning the language and meaning of the Teaching, we can become astute
 as far as theory is concerned; but if we don't use that knowledge to train
 ourselves, it's as if we studied a profession — such as law — but then
 went out to become bandits, so that our knowledge wouldn't give its proper
 results.
 For this reason, we've been taught still another method, which is the well-spri
ng of discernment or mastery — i.e., the mental activity termed bhavanamaya-pañña.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Bhavanamaya-pañña: discernment that arises exclusively from the practice
 of concentration.
 In other words, this level of discernment isn't related to the old observations
 we have gained from the past, because our old observations are bound to
 obscure the new observations, endowed with the truth, that can arise only
 right at the mind.
 When you engage in this form of practice, focus exclusively on the present,
 taking note of a single thing, not getting involved with past or future.
 Steady the mind, bringing it into the present.
 Gather virtue, concentration, and discernment all into the present.
 Think of your meditation object and bring your powers of evaluation to
 bear on it — say, by immersing mindfulness in the body, focusing on such
 objects as the in-and-out breath.
 When you do this, knowledge will arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Ñanam udapadi': Intuitive knowledge of things we have never before studied
 or known will appear.
 For example: pubbenivasanussati-ñana — the ability to remember our present
 life and past lives; cutupapata-ñana — the ability to know living beings
 as they die and are reborn — well or poorly, happily or miserably — knowing
 the causes and results of how they fare; asavakkhaya-ñana — the ability
 to cleanse ourselves of the effluents that defile the mind, thinning them
 out or eliminating them altogether, as we are able.
 These three forms of knowledge don't arise for people who simply study
 or think things through in ordinary ways.
 They form a mental skill that arises from the practice of concentration
 and are an aspect of Dhamma on the level of practice (patipatti-dhamma).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another aspect — 'pañña udapadi': Clear discernment of the true nature of
 the properties (dhatu), aggregates, and sense media arises.
 We can focus on these things by way of the mind and know them in terms
 of the four Noble Truths: stress (dukkha), which arises from a cause (samudaya)
, i.e., ignorance and craving; and then nirodha, the ceasing and disbanding
 of stress, which occurs as the result of a cause, i.e., the Path (magga),
 composed of practices for the mind.
 These things can be known by means of the discernment that arises exclusively
 and directly within us and is termed the eye of discernment or the eye
 of Dhamma: the eye of the mind, awakening from its slumbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Vijja udapadi': The eight forms of cognitive skill, which follow the laws
 of cause and effect — means of practice that bring us results — can arise
 in a quiet mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Aloko udapadi': Brightness, clarity, relief, and emptiness arise in such
 a mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the discernment that results from developing the mind differs from
 the beginning stages of discernment that come from studying and reflecting.
 Study and reflection are classed as Dhamma on the level of theory, and
 can give only a preliminary level of knowledge.
 They're like a person who has awakened but has yet to open his eyes.
 The discernment that comes from developing the mind, though, is like waking
 up and seeing the truth — past, present, and future — in all four directions.
 We can clearly see stress, its cause, its disbanding, and the Path to its
 disbanding, and so can abandon the first set of Fetters.
 Our hearts will then flow to nibbana, just as the water in a mountain cataract
 is sure to flow to the sea.
 Our hearts will flow to their natural truth: the mental fullness and completene
ss of a person who has practiced mental development until discernment arises
 within.
 We will meet with a special form of wisdom — transcendent wisdom — whose
 power will stay with us always, a quality that's certain and sure, termed
 certain truth, certain wisdom, making us people certain for nibbana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this level of discernment — termed the discernment of liberating insight
 — is especially important.
 It arises on its own, not from cogitating along the lines of old concepts
 we've learned, but from abandoning them.
 Old concepts are what obscure the new knowledge ready to arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of liberating insight is like an electric light: Simply press
 the switch once, and things all around are made bright.
 In the same way, when the mind reaches a stage of readiness, insight will
 arise in a single mental instant, and everything will become clear: properties,
 aggregates, and the sense media.
 We'll know, on the one hand, what's inconstant (aniccam), stressful (dukkham),
 and not-self (anatta); and on the other hand, what's uncommon, i.e., niccam
 — what's constant and true; sukham — true happiness, termed niramisa-sukha;
 and atta — the self.
 The eye of the mind can know both sides and let go both ways.
 It's attached neither to what's inconstant, stressful, and not-self; nor
 to what's constant (niccam), good (sukham), and right (atta).
 It can let these things go, in line with their true nature.
 The knowledge that comes from discernment, cognitive skill, and intuitive
 insight, it can let go as well.
 It isn't attached to views — for there's yet another, separate sort of
 reality that has no 'this' or 'that.' In other words, it has no sense of
 'I.' It lets go of the assumptions that, 'That's the self,' 'That's not
 the self,' 'That's constant,' 'That's inconstant,' 'That arises,' 'That
 doesn't arise.' It can let go of these things completely.
 That's the Dhamma, and yet it doesn't hold onto the Dhamma, which is why
 we say that the Dhamma is not-self.
 It also doesn't hold on to the view that says, 'not-self.' It lets go of
 views, causes, and effects, and isn't attached to anything at all dealing
 with wordings or meanings, conventions or practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, then, is discernment that arises from the development of the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: The discernment that comes from studying and reflecting is
 classed as Dhamma on the level of theory.
 The discernment that comes from developing the mind is classed as Dhamma
 on the level of practice.
 The results that arise are two —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Mundane discernment: comprehension — of the world and the Dhamma — falling
 under mundane influences and subject to change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Transcendent discernment: awareness that goes beyond the ordinary, giving
 rise to clear realization within.
 People who reach this level are said to have awakened and opened their
 eyes, which is what is meant by 'Buddho.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dhamma Talks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insight isn't something that can be taught.
 It's something you have to give rise to within yourself.
 It's not something you simply memorize and talk about.
 If we were to teach it just so we could memorize it, I can guarantee that
 it wouldn't take five hours.
 But if you wanted to understand one word of it, three years might not even
 be enough.
 Memorizing gives rise simply to memories.
 Acting is what gives rise to the truth.
 This is why it takes effort and persistence for you to understand and master
 this skill on your own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When insight arises, you'll know what's what, where it's come from, and
 where it's going — as when we see a lantern burning brightly: We know that,
 'That's the flame...
 That's the smoke...
 That's the light.' We know how these things arise from mixing what with
 what, and where the flame goes when we put out the lantern.
 All of this is the skill of insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people say that tranquillity meditation and insight meditation are
 two separate things — but how can that be true? tranquillity meditation
 is 'stopping,' insight meditation is 'thinking' that leads to clear knowledge.
 When there's clear knowledge, the mind stops still and stays put.
 They're all part of the same thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing has to come from stopping.
 If you don't stop, how can you know? For instance, if you're sitting in
 a car or a boat that is traveling fast and you try to look at the people
 or things passing by right next to you along the way, you can't see clearly
 who's who or what's what.
 But if you stop still in one place, you'll be able to see things clearly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or even closer to home: When we speak, there has to be a pause between each
 phrase.
 If you tried to talk without any pauses at all, would anyone be able to
 understand what you said?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why we first have to make the mind stop to be quiet and still.
 When the mind stays still in a state of normalcy, concentration arises
 and discernment follows.
 This is something you have to work at and do for yourself.
 Don't simply believe what others say.
 Get so that you know 'Oh! Oh! Oh!' from within, and not just 'Oh? Oh? Oh?'from
 what people say.
 Don't take the good things they say and stick them in your heart.
 You have to make these things your own by getting them to arise from within
 you.
 Spending one dollar of your own money is better than spending 100 dollars
 you've borrowed from someone else.
 If you use borrowed money, you have to worry because you're in debt.
 If you use your own money, there's nothing to worry about.
\end_layout

Stopping is what gives rise to strength.
 If a man is walking or running, he can't put up a good fight with anyone,
 because the advantage lies with the person standing still, not with the
 person walking or running.
 This is why we're taught to make the mind stop still so that it can gain
 strength.
 Then it will be able to start walking again with strength and agility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's true that we have two feet, but when we walk we have to step with one
 foot at a time.
 If you try to step with both feet at once, you won't get anywhere.
 Or if you try to walk with just one foot, you can't do that either.
 When the right foot stops, the left foot has to take a step.
 When the left foot stops, the right foot has to take a step.
 You have to stop with one foot and step with the other if you're going
 to walk with any strength because the strength comes from the foot that
 has stopped, not from the foot taking a step.
 One side has to stop while the other side takes a step.
 Otherwise, you'll have no support and are sure to fall down.
 If you don't believe me, try stepping with both feet at once and see how
 far you get.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same way, tranquillity and insight have to go together.
 You first have to make the mind stop in tranquillity and then take a step
 in your investigation: This is insight meditation.
 The understanding that arises is discernment.
 To let go of your attachment to that understanding is release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So stopping is the factor that gives rise to strength, knowledge, and discernmen
t — the fixed mind that knows both the world and the Dhamma in a state of
 heightened virtue, heightened consciousness, and heightened discernment
 leading on to the transcendent.

\begin_layout Standard
To get full results from our meditation, the mind has to give the orders.
 Mindfulness is what does the work and assists in the progress of all our
 activities, while alertness is what observes the results of what we've
 done.
 To speak in terms of the frames of reference, these qualities are called
 mindfulness and alertness.
 To speak in terms of jhana, they're called directed thought and evaluation.
 They're the qualities that give rise to discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment comes from observing causes and effects.
 If we know effects without knowing causes, that doesn't qualify as discernment.
 If we know causes without knowing effects, that doesn't qualify, either.
 We have to know both of them together with our mindfulness and alertness.
 This is what qualifies as all-around knowing in the full sense of the term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The all-around knowing that arises within us comes from causes and effects,
 not from what we read in books, hear other people tell us, or conjecture
 on our own.
 Suppose we have some silver coins in our pocket.
 If all we know is that other people tell us it's money, we don't know its
 qualities.
 But if we experiment with it and put it in a smelter to see what it's made
 of and to see how it can be made into other things, that's when we'll know
 its true qualities.
 This is the kind of knowledge that comes from our own actions.
 This knowledge, when we meditate, comes in five forms.
 We find within ourselves that some things are caused by the properties
 of the body, some are caused by the mind, some causes come from the mind
 but have an effect on the body, some causes come from the body but have
 an effect on the mind, some causes come from the body and mind acting together.
 This kind of knowledge is discernment.
 So we have to learn from virtue, concentration, and discernment by giving
 rise to them.
 If we don't, we'll suffer from unawareness and delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness is what brings light to the mind, like a candle.
 If we take a candle into a room at night, close the windows and doors,
 and fill in all the cracks in the walls, no wind from outside will be able
 to slip in and make the flame waver.
 The flame will give off even more light, and we'll be able to see everything
 in the room clearly.
 Closing the windows and doors and filling in the cracks means exercising
 restraint over our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, so that our
 attention doesn't go straying out after outside perceptions and preoccupations.
 This is called restraint through mindfulness.
 Our mindfulness will gather into one.
 When mindfulness is strong, the results are immediate: a sense of ease
 and mental well-being.
 When mindfulness is solid and unflagging, our concentration will become
 stronger.
 The mind will be still and upright.
 Light will arise in one of two ways: from within ourself or from what's
 reflected off the walls.
 This is why mindfulness is the cause, the supporting factor, that keeps
 our concentration progressing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does discernment come from? You might compare it with learning to become
 a potter, a tailor, or a basket weaver.
 The teacher will start out by telling you how to make a pot, sew a shirt
 or a pair of pants, or weave different patterns, but the proportions and
 beauty of the object you make will have to depend on your own powers of
 observation.
 Suppose you weave a basket and then take a good look at its proportions,
 to see if it's too short or too tall.
 If it's too short, weave another one, a little taller, and then take a
 good look at it to see if there's anything that still needs improving,
 to see if it's too thin or too fat.
 Then weave another one, better-looking than the last.
 Keep this up until you have one that's as beautiful and well-proportioned
 as possible, one with nothing to criticize from any angle.
 This last basket you can take as your standard.
 You can now set yourself up in business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What you've done is to learn from your own actions.
 As for your previous efforts, you needn't concern yourself with them any
 longer.
 Throw them out.
 This is a sense of discernment that arises of its own accord, an ingenuity
 and sense of judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught
 you, but from observing and evaluating on your own the object that you
 yourself have made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same holds true in practicing meditation.
 For discernment to arise, you have to be observant as you keep track of
 the breath and to gain a sense of how to adjust and improve it so that
 it's well-proportioned throughout the body — to the point where it flows
 evenly without faltering, so that it' s comfortable in slow and out slow,
 in fast and out fast, long, short, heavy, or refined.
 Get so that both the in-breath and the out-breath are comfortable no matter
 what way you breathe, so that — no matter when — you immediately feel a
 sense of ease the moment you focus on the breath.
 When you can do this, physical results will appear: a sense of ease and
 lightness, open and spacious.
 The body will be strong, the breath and blood will flow unobstructed and
 won't form an opening for disease to step in.
 The body will be healthy and awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the mind, when mindfulness and alertness are the causes, a still
 mind is the result.
 When negligence is the cause, a mind distracted and restless is the result.
 So we must try to make the causes good, in order to give rise to the good
 results we've referred to.
 If we use our powers of observation and evaluation in caring for the breath,
 and are constantly correcting and improving it, we'll develop awareness
 on our own, the fruit of having developed our concentration higher step
 by step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind is focused with full circumspection, it can let go of concepts
 of the past.
 It sees the true nature of its old preoccupations, that there's nothing
 lasting or certain about them.
 As for the future lying ahead of us, it's like having to sail a small boat
 across the great wide sea: There are bound to be dangers on all sides.
 So the mind lets go of concepts of the future and comes into the present,
 seeing and knowing the present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind stands firm and doesn't sway.Unawareness falls away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge arises for an instant and then disappears, so that you can know
 that there in the present is a void.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A void.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You don't latch on to world-fashionings of the past, world-fashionings of
 the future, or dhamma-fashionings of the present.
 Fashionings disappear.
 Avijja — counterfeit, untrue awareness — disappears.
 'True' disappears.
 All that remains is awareness: 'buddha...
 buddha...'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The factor that fashions the body, i.e., the breath; the factors that fashion
 speech, i.e., thoughts that formulate words; and the factor that fashions
 the mind, i.e., thinking, all disappear.
 But awareness doesn't disappear.
 When the factor that fashions the body moves, you're aware of it.
 When the factor that fashions speech moves, you're aware of it.
 When the factor that fashions the mind moves, you're aware of it, but awareness
 isn't attached to anything it knows.
 In other words, no fashionings can affect it.
 There's simply awareness.
 At a thought, the mind appears, fashionings appear.
 If you want to use them, there they are.
 If not, they disappear on their own, by their very nature.
 Awareness is above everything else.
 This is release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meditators have to reach this sort of awareness if they're to get good results.
 In training the mind, this is all there is.
 Complications are a lot of fuss and bother, and tend to bog down without
 ever getting to the real point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Frames of Reference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In using the mind as a frame of reference, there are three aspects to deal
 with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 The mind inside.
 B.
 The mind outside.
 C.
 The mind in and of itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'The mind inside' refers to a state exclusively in the heart when it isn't
 involved with any outer preoccupations.
 'The mind outside' refers to its interaction with such outer preoccupations
 as sights, sounds, etc.
 'The mind in and of itself' refers to the act of singling out any aspect
 of the mind as it appears, whether inside or out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the modes of the mind inside, there are three —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Raga-citta: a mental state infused with desire or passion.
 2.
 Dosa-citta: a sense of inner irritation and displeasure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Moha-citta: a cloudy, murky or confused state of mind, in which it is unable
 to consider anything; in short, delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind outside is divided into the same three aspects — states of passion,
 irritation and delusion — but these are said to be 'outside' because once
 any of these aspects arises, it tends to go out and latch onto an outer
 preoccupation that simply serves to further aggravate the original state
 of passion, irritation or delusion.
 The mind then doesn't clearly or truly understand its objects.
 Its knowledge goes off in various directions, away from the truth: seeing
 beauty, for instance, in things that aren't beautiful, constancy in things
 that are inconstant, pleasure in things that are painful, and self in things
 that are not-self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these things are aspects of the mind outside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'The mind in and of itself' refers to the act of singling out any one of
 these aspects of the mind.
 For example, sometimes passion arises, sometimes anger, sometimes delusion:
 Whichever aspect may be arising in the present, single it out.
 With your alertness firmly in place, be mindful of that aspect of the mind,
 without making reference to any other objects — and without letting any
 hopes or wants arise in that particular mental moment at all.
 Then focus unwaveringly on investigating that state of mind until you know
 its truth.
 The truth of these states is that sometimes, once they've arisen, they
 flare up and spread; sometimes they die away.
 Their nature is to arise for a moment and then dissolve away with nothing
 of any substance or worth.
 When you are intent on examining things in this way — with your mindfulness,
 alertness, and powers of focused investigation firmly in place — then none
 of these defilements, even though they may be appearing, will have the
 chance to grow or spread.
 This is like the baskets or jars used to cover new lettuce plants: If no
 one removes the baskets, the plants will never have a chance to grow, and
 will simply wither away and die.
 Thus you have to keep your alertness right with each mental state as it
 arises.
 Keep mindfulness constantly referring to its object, and use your powers
 of focused investigation to burn into those defilements so as to keep them
 away from the heart at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To put this another way, all of the mental states mentioned above are like
 lettuce or green-gram seeds.
 Mindfulness is like a basket.
 Alertness is the person who scatters the seeds, while the power of focused
 investigation is the heat of the sun that burns them up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, we have mentioned only bad mental states.
 Their opposites are good mental states: viraga-citta — the mind free from
 the grip of passion; adosa-citta — the mind free from the annoyance or
 anger that can lead to loss and ruin; amoha-citta — the mind free from
 delusion, intoxication and misunderstandings.
 These are skillful states of mind (kusala-citta), which form the root of
 all that is good.
 When they arise, maintain them and observe them so that you can come to
 know the level of your mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four levels of good mental states —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Kamavacara-bhumi: the level of sensuality.
 2.
 Rupavacara-bhumi: the level of form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Arupavacara-bhumi: the level of formlessness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Lokuttara-bhumi: the transcendent level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The level of sensuality: A mental state arises and connects with a wholesome
 object — any sight, sound, smell, taste, tactile sensation or idea that
 can form the basis for skillful mental states.
 When it meets with its object, it becomes happy, joyful, and glad.
 (Here we're referring only to those sensory objects that are good for the
 mind.) If you were to refer to the Heavens of Sensual Bliss as they appear
 within each of us, the list would run as follows: Sights that can form
 the basis for skillful mental states are one level, sounds are another,
 and same with smells, tastes, tactile sensations and ideas.
 Together they form the six levels of heaven on the sensual level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The level of form: A mental state arises from thinking about (vitakka)
 a physical object that serves as the theme of one's meditation; and then
 analyzing (vicara) the object into its various aspects, at the same time
 making sure that the mind doesn't slip away from the object (ekaggatarammana).
 When the mind and its object are one in this way, the object becomes light.
 The mind is unburdened and can relax its sense of concern.
 Rapture (piti) and ease (sukha) arise as a result.
 When these five factors appear in the mind, it has entered the first jhana
 — the beginning stage in the level of form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 The level of formlessness: The mind lets go of its physical object on the
 level of form, but is still attached to a very subtle mental notion — the
 jhana of unbounded space, for instance, in which you are focused on a sense
 of emptiness and awareness with no physical object or image passing into
 your field of attention, so that you are unable to know its full range.
 What has actually happened is that you have curled up and are hiding inside.
 This isn't the kind of 'going in to know' that comes from finishing your
 work.
 It's the 'going in to know' that comes from wanting to run away.
 You've seen the faults of what arises outside you, but haven't seen that
 they really lie buried within you — so you've hidden inside by limiting
 the field of your attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people, when they reach this point, believe that they have done away
 with defilement, because they mistake the emptiness for nibbana.
 Actually, it's only the first stage in the level of formlessness, and so
 is still on the mundane level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you seriously want to know whether your mind is on the mundane or the
 transcendent level, then observe it when you turn your awareness inward
 and make it still — when you feel a sense of peace and ease that seems
 to have no defilements adulterating it at all.
 Let go of that mental state, to see how it behaves on its own.
 If defilements can reappear, you're still on the mundane level.
 Sometimes that mental state remains unchanged through the power of your
 own efforts, but after a while you become unsure of your knowledge.
 Your mind has to keep fondling, i.e., making a running commentary on it.
 When this is the case, don't go believing that your knowledge is in any
 way true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many, many kinds of knowledge: The intellect knows, the heart
 knows, the mind knows, consciousness knows, discernment knows, alertness
 knows, awareness knows, unawareness knows.
 All these modes are based on knowledge; they differ simply in how they
 know.
 If you aren't able to distinguish clearly among the different modes of
 knowing, knowing can become confused — and so you might take wrong knowing
 to be right knowing, or unawareness to be awareness, or knowledge attached
 to suppositions (sammuti) to be freedom from suppositions (vimutti).
 Thus you should experiment and examine things carefully from all angles
 so that you can come to see for yourself which kind of knowledge is genuine,
 and which is counterfeit.
 Counterfeit knowledge, merely knows, but can't let go.
 Genuine knowledge, when it goes about knowing anything, is bound to let
 go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All three levels of the mind discussed so far are on the mundane level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 The transcendent level: This begins with the path and fruition of entry
 into the stream to nibbana.
 Those who reach this level have begun by following the threefold training
 of virtue, concentration and discernment on the mundane level, but then
 have gone on to gain their first true insight into the four Noble Truths,
 enabling them to free themselves from the first three Fetters (sanyojana).
 Their minds are thus released into the stream to nibbana.
 The three Fetters are —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 Self-identification (sakkaya-ditthi): the view that leads us to believe
 that the body is our own.
 b.
 Doubt (vicikiccha): the uncertainty that leads us to be unsure of the good
 we believe in — i.e., of how much truth there is to the Buddha, Dhamma and
 Sangha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.
 Attachment to precepts and practices (silabbata-paramasa): fondling the
 good that we practice; being attached to those forms of goodness that are
 merely external — for instance, observing precepts or practices by clinging
 simply to the level of bodily action or speech.
 Examples of this attitude include such things as developing virtue by adhering
 simply to the precepts; practicing concentration by simply sitting like
 a post; not being able to free yourself from these actions, always holding
 onto the goodness that comes from them, happy when you have the chance
 to perform them in a particular way, upset when you don't; thinking, for
 instance, that virtue is something you get from monks when they give you
 the precepts; that the eight precepts are to be observed only on certain
 days and nights, months and years; that you gain or lose merit simply as
 a result of external actions associated with your accustomed beliefs.
 None of these attitudes reaches the essence of virtue.
 They go no further than simply clinging to beliefs, customs, and conventions;
 clutching onto these forms of goodness, always fondling them, unable to
 let them go.
 Thus this is called 'attachment to precepts and practices.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such attitudes are an obstacle to what is truly good.
 Take, for example, the long-held belief that goodness means to practice
 charity, virtue and meditation on the sabbath days: stream-winners have
 completely let go of such beliefs.
 Their hearts are no longer caught up in beliefs and customs.
 Their virtues no longer have precepts.
 In other words, they have reached the essence of virtue.
 Their virtue is free from the limits of time.
 In this they differ from ordinary, run-of-the-mill people.
 Ordinary people have to hand goodness over to external criteria — believing,
 for instance, that virtue lies on this day or that, during Rains Retreat,
 during this or that month or year — and then holding fast to that belief,
 maintaining that anyone who doesn't follow the custom can't be virtuous.
 In the end, such people have a hard time finding the opportunity really
 to do good.
 Thus we can say that they don't know the true criteria for goodness.
 As for stream-winners, all the qualities of virtue have come in and filled
 their hearts.
 They are able to unshackle themselves from the conventional values of the
 world that say that this or that is good.
 What is truly good they have seen appear in their hearts.
 Good lies right here.
 Evil lies right here.
 Neither depends on external actions.
 This is in line with the Buddha's saying,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
mano-pubbangama dhammamano-settha mano-maya
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All matters are preceded by the heart, Excelled by the heart, Achieved through
 the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is what is meant by 'stream-winner'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stream-winners are like people who have rowed their boats into the main
 current of the Chao Phraya River, and so are destined to float down to
 the river's mouth and into the sea of amata — deathless — nibbana.
 There are three ways they can reach the sea:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) The lowest level of stream-winner is like a boatsman who leans back
 with his hand simply placed on the rudder.
 This level of stream-winner reaches the goal slowly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The second level is like a boatsman who has his foot on the rudder,
 his hands on the oars, and rows along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) The third level: The boat is equipped with a motor and the boatsman
 is at the steering wheel, and so he reaches the goal in practically no
 time at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This — reaching the stream to nibbana — is the beginning stage of the transcende
nt level.
 If you were to simplify the three Fetters, you could do so as follows:
 To be attached to the body as being one's own is self-identification.
 To be attached to the actions of the body is attachment to precepts and
 practices.
 Not knowing how to separate the mind from the body or from one's actions
 makes one unable to see clearly and know truly: This leads to uncertainty
 and doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are simply my opinions on the matter, so you who read this should
 consider things carefully on your own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ends the discussion of the transcendent and mundane skillful states
 of mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you know the characteristics of the various mental states, you should
 use the three qualities mentioned above as your tools: Keep your mindfulness,
 alertness, and powers of focused investigation firmly in place at the mind.
 To be able to gain knowledge, you have to use the power of focused investigatio
n, which is an aspect of discernment, to know how mental states arise and
 fall: pulling out, taking a stance, and then returning into stillness.
 You must keep your attention fixed on investigating these things constantly
 in order to be able to know the arising and falling away of mental states
 — and you will come to know the nature of the mind that doesn't arise and
 doesn't fall away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To know the arising and falling away of mental states of the past is one
 level of cognitive skill (vijja), and deserves to be called 'knowledge
 of previous births.' To know the states of the mind as they change in the
 present deserves to be called 'knowledge of death and rebirth.' To know
 how to separate mental states from their objects, knowing the primal nature
 of the mind, knowing the current or force of the mind that flows to its
 objects; separating the objects, the current of mind that flows, and the
 primal nature of the mind: To be able to know in this way deserves to be
 called 'knowledge of the ending of mental effluents.' The objects or preoccupati
ons of the mind are the effluent of sensuality.
 The current that flows is the effluent of becoming.
 Not knowing the primal nature of the mind is the effluent of unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to express this in terms of the four Noble Truths, we would have
 to do so as follows: The objects or preoccupations of the mind are the
 truth of stress (dukkha-sacca).
 The current of the mind that flows into and falls for its objects is the
 truth of the cause of stress (samudaya-sacca).
 The mental state that penetrates in to see clearly the truth of all objects,
 the current of the mind, and the primal nature of the mind, is called the
 mental moment that forms the Path (magga-citta).
 To let go of the objects, the mental current, and the primal nature of
 the mind, without any sense of attachment, is the truth of the disbanding
 of stress (nirodha-sacca).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the three qualities that assist the mind — alertness, mindfulness,
 and focused investigation — are vigorous and strong, alertness becomes
 the awareness of release (vijja-vimutti), mindfulness becomes intuitive
 understanding (ñana), and focused investigation becomes liberating insight
 (vipassana-ñana), the discernment that can stay fixed on knowing the truth
 of stress without permitting any sense of pleasure or displeasure for its
 object to arise.
 Intuitive understanding fathoms the cause of stress, and the awareness
 of release knows the heart clearly all the way through.
 When you can know in this way, you can say that you know rightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here I'd like to back up and discuss the question of the mind in a little
 more detail.
 The word 'mind' covers three aspects:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) The primal nature of the mind.
 (2) Mental states.
 (3) Mental states in interaction with their objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these aspects, taken together, make up the mind.
 If you don't know the mind in this way, you can't say that you really know
 it.
 All you can do is say that the mind arises and falls away, the mind doesn't
 rise or fall away; the mind is good, the mind is evil; the mind becomes
 annihilated, the mind doesn't become annihilated; the mind is a dhamma,
 the mind isn't a dhamma; the mind gains release, the mind doesn't gain
 release; the mind is nibbana, the mind isn't nibbana; the mind is sensory
 consciousness, the mind isn't sensory consciousness; the mind is the heart,
 the mind isn't the heart...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the Buddha taught, there are only two paths to practice — the body, speech,
 and heart; and the body, speech, and mind — and in the end both paths reach
 the same point: Their true goal is release.
 So if you want to know the truth concerning any of the above issues, you
 have to follow the path and reach the truth on your own.
 Otherwise, you'll have to argue endlessly.
 These issues — for people who haven't practiced all the way to clear insight
 — have been termed by people of wisdom as sedamocana-katha: issues that
 can only make you break out in a sweat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I would like to make a short explanation: The primal nature of the mind
 is a nature that simply knows.
 The current that thinks and streams out from knowing to various objects
 is a mental state.
 When this current connects with its objects and falls for them, it becomes
 a defilement, darkening the mind: This is a mental state in interaction.
 Mental states, by themselves and in interaction, whether good or evil,
 have to arise, have to disband, have to dissolve away by their very nature.
 The source of both these sorts of mental states is the primal nature of
 the mind, which neither arises nor disbands.
 It is a fixed phenomenon (thiti-dhamma), always in place.
 By the primal nature of the mind — which is termed 'pabhassara,' or radiant
 — I mean the ordinary, elementary state of knowing in the present.
 But whoever isn't able to penetrate in to know it can't gain any good from
 it, like the proverbial monkey with the diamond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the name given by the Buddha for this state of affairs is really fitting:
 avijja — dark knowledge, counterfeit knowledge.
 This is in line with the terms 'pubbante aññanam' — not knowing the beginning,
 i.e., the primal nature of the mind; 'parante aññanam' — not knowing the
 end, i.e., mental states in interaction with their objects; 'majjhantika
 aññanam' — not knowing the middle, i.e., the current that streams from the
 primal nature of knowing.
 When this is the case, the mind becomes a sankhara: a concoctor, a magician,
 fabricating prolifically in its myriad ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ends the discussion of the mind as a frame of reference.

\begin_layout Standard
From Basic Themes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IV.
 Mindfulness of Death: Insight Meditation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, keep death in mind.
 This is where the mind advances to the development of liberating insight,
 taking death as its theme.
 'Death' here refers to the death occurring in the present — physical sensations
 arising and passing away, mental acts arising and passing away, all in
 a moment of awareness.
 Only when you're aware on this level can you be classed as being mindful
 of death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've brought up the topic of death, we have to reflect on birth,
 seeing how many ways sensations are born and how many ways mental acts
 are born.
 This is something a person with a quiet mind can know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 Sensations have up to five levels of refinement —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Hina-rupa: coarse sensations, sensations of discomfort, aches and pains.
 When these arise, focus on what causes them until they disappear.
 2.
 Panita-rupa: exquisite sensations that make the body feel pleasurable,
 light, and refined.
 Focus on what causes them until they disappear...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Sukhumala-rupa: delicate sensations, tender, yielding, and agile.
 When they arise, focus on what causes them until they disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Olarika-rupa: physical sensations that give a sense of grandeur, exuberance,
 brightness, and exultation: 'Mukhavanno vipassidati.' When they arise, focus
 on finding out what causes them until they disappear...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All four of these sensations arise and disband by their very nature; and
 it's possible to find out where they first appear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 'Mano-bhava': imagined circumstances that appear through the power of the
 mind.
 When they arise, focus on keeping track of them until they disappear.
 Once you're able to know in this way, you enter the sphere of true mindfulness
 of death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An explanation of this sort of sensation: When the mind is quiet and steadily
 concentrated, it has the power to create images in the imagination (inner
 sensations, or sensations within sensations).
 Whatever images it thinks of will then appear to it; and once they appear,
 the mind tends to enter into them and take up residence.
 (It can go great distances.) If the mind fastens onto these sensations,
 it is said to take birth — simply because it has no sense of death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These sensations can appear in any of five ways: —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 arising from the posture of the body, disappearing when the posture changes;
 b.
 arising from thoughts imbued with greed, hatred, or delusion — arising,
 taking a stance, and then disbanding;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.
 arising with an in-breath and disbanding with the following out-breath;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.
 arising from the cleansing of the blood in the lungs — appearing and disbanding
 in a single instant;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
e.
 arising from the heart's pumping blood into the various parts of the body,
 the pressure of the blood causing sensations to arise that correspond to
 sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations.
 Sensations of this sort are arising and disbanding every moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another class of sensation is termed 'gocara-rupa' — sensations that circle
 around the physical body.
 There are five sorts — light, sound, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations
 — each having five levels.
 For instance, common light travels slowly; in the flash of an eye it runs
 for a league and then dies away.
 The second level, subtle light, goes further; and the third level goes
 further still.
 The fourth and fifth levels can travel the entire universe.
 The same holds true for sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations.
 The relationships between all the potentials in the universe are interacting
 at every moment, differing only as to whether they're fast or slow.
 This is the inequality that has been termed 'anicca-lakkhana' — inherent
 inconstancy.
 Whoever is ignorant is bound to think that all this is impossible, but
 actually this is the way things already are by their nature.
 We'll come to know this through vijja — cognitive skill — not through ordinary
 labels and concepts.
 This is called true knowing, which meditators who develop the inner eye
 will realize for themselves: knowing the arising of these sensations, their
 persisting and their disbanding, in terms of their primary qualities and
 basic regularity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing things for what they really are.
 Release, purity, dispassion, disbanding; Nibbanam paramam sukham:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nibbana is the ultimate ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
B.
 As for mental acts that arise and die, their timespan is many thousands
 of times faster than that of sensations.
 To be able to keep track of their arising and dying away, our awareness
 has to be still.
 The four kinds of mental acts are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— Vedana: the mind's experience of feelings of pleasure, pain, and indifference.
 — Sañña: recognizing and labeling the objects of the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— Sankhara: mental fabrications or fashionings of good and bad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— Viññana: distinct consciousness or cognizance of objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One class of these mental acts stays in place, arising and disbanding with
 reference to the immediate present.
 Another class is termed 'gocara vedana' 'gocara sañña,' etc., which go out
 to refer to the world.
 Each of these has five levels, differing as to whether they're common,
 refined, or subtle, slow or fast.
 These five levels connect with each other, running out in stages, and then
 circling back to their starting point, disbanding and then arising again
 — all without end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we don't have the skill to discern the primary sensations and mental
 acts that stay in place, we can't see into the 'gocara' sensations and
 mental acts that go flowing around.
 This is termed 'avijja,' the unawareness that opens the way for connecting
 consciousness (patisandhi viññana), giving rise to the act of fashioning
 (sankhara), which is the essence of kamma.
 This gives fruit as sensations and feelings that are followed by craving,
 and then the act of labeling, which gives rise to another level of consciousnes
s — of sensory objects — and then the cycle goes circling on.
 This is termed the 'khandha-vatta,' the cycle of the aggregates, circling
 and changing unevenly and inconsistently.
 To see this is called aniccanupassana-ñana, the knowledge that keeps track
 of inconstancy as it occurs.
 This is known through the inner eye, i.e., the skill of genuine discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, those who practice the exercises of insight meditation should use
 their sensitivities and circumspection to the full if they hope to gain
 release from unawareness.
 Fashionings, in this context, are like waves on the ocean.
 If we're out in a boat on the ocean when the waves are high, our vision
 is curtailed.
 Our senses of hearing, smell, taste, touch, and ideation are all curtailed.
 We won't be able to perceive far into the distance.
 What this means is that when our minds are immersed in the Hindrances,
 we won't be able to perceive death at all.
 But once we've been able to suppress the Hindrances, it's like taking a
 boat across the ocean when there are no waves.
 We'll be able to see objects far in the distance.
 Our eyes will be clear-seeing, our ears clear-hearing, our senses of smell,
 taste, touch and ideation will be broad and wide open.
 The water will be clear, and the light brilliant.
 We'll be able to know all around us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same way, those who are to know death clearly have to begin by practicing
 concentration as a foundation for developing liberating insight.
 How do the five sorts of above-mentioned sensation arise? What are their
 causes? How do they disappear? How do physical and mental feelings arise?
 How do they disappear? What are their causes? How do labels and concepts
 arise? What are their causes? How do they disappear? How do mental fashionings
 arise? What are their causes? How do they disappear? How does consciousness
 arise by way of the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and
 ideation? What are its causes? How does it disappear?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Altogether there are four levels to each of the five aggregates (khandhas):
 external and internal, staying in place and streaming outward.
 These can be known at all times, but only people who have the discernment
 that comes from training the mind in tranquillity and insight meditation
 will be able to know death on this level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discernment that arises in this way has been termed 'pubbenivas-anussati-ñan
a, i.e., understanding past sensations, future sensations, and sensations
 in the present.
 These sensations differ in the way they arise and pass away.
 To know this is to have mastered one cognitive skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cutupapata-ñana: With discernment of this sort, we're able to keep track
 of the states of our own mind as they arise and disappear, sometimes good
 as they arise and good as they disappear, sometimes bad as they arise and
 bad as they disappear, sometimes good as they arise and bad as they disappear,
 sometimes bad as they arise and good as they disappear.
 To be able to keep track in this way is to know states of being and birth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asavakkhaya-ñana: When the discernment of this skill arises, it leads to
 disenchantment with the way sensations and mental acts arise and disappear
 and then arise again, simply circling about: coarser sensations going through
 the cycle slowly, more refined sensations going quickly; coarser mental
 acts going slowly, more refined mental acts going quickly.
 When you can keep track of this, you know one form of stress.
 Now focus attention back on your own mind to see whether or not it's neutral
 at that moment.
 If the mind approves of its knowledge or of the things it knows, that's
 kamasukhallikanuyoga — indulgence in pleasure.
 If the mind disapproves of its knowledge or of the things it knows, that's
 attakilamathanuyoga, indulgence in self-infliction.
 Once you've seen this, make the mind neutral toward whatever it may know:
 That moment of awareness is the mental state forming the Path.
 When the Path arises, the causes of stress disband.
 Try your best to keep that mental state going.
 Follow that train of awareness as much as you can.
 The mind when it's in that state is said to be developing the Path — and
 at whatever moment the Path stands firm, disbanding and relinquishing occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you can do this, you reach the level where you know death clearly.
 People who know death in this way are then able to reduce the number of
 their own deaths.
 Some of the Noble Ones have seven more deaths ahead of them, some have
 only one more, others go beyond death entirely.
 These Noble Ones are people who understand birth and death, and for this
 reason have only a few deaths left to them.
 Ordinary people who understand their own birth and death on this level
 are hard to find.
 Common, ordinary birth and death aren't especially necessary; but people
 who don't understand the Dhamma have to put up with birth and death as
 a common thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So whoever is to know death on this level will have to develop the cognitive
 skill that comes from training the mind.
 The skill, here, is knowing which preoccupations of the mind are in the
 past, which are in the future, and which are in the present.
 This is cognitive skill (vijja).
 Letting go of the past, letting go of the future, letting go of the present,
 not latching onto anything at all: This is purity and release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for unawareness, it's the exact opposite: not knowing what's past, not
 knowing what's future, not knowing what's present — that is, the arising
 and falling away of sensations and mental acts, or body and mind — or at
 most knowing only on the level of labels and concepts remembered from what
 other people have said, not knowing on the level of awareness that we've
 developed on our own.
 All of this is classed as avijja, or unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No matter how much we may use words of wisdom and discernment, it still
 won't gain us release.
 For instance, we may know that things are inconstant, but we still fall
 for inconstant things.
 We may know about things that are stressful, but we still fall for them.
 We may know that things are not-self, but we still fall for things that
 are not-self.
 Our knowledge of inconstancy, stress, and not-self isn't true.
 Then how are these things truly known? Like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing both sides,letting go both ways,shedding everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Knowing both sides' means knowing what's constant and what's inconstant,
 what's stress and what's ease, what's not-self and what's self.
 'Letting go both ways' means not latching onto things that are constant
 or inconstant, not latching onto stress or ease, not latching onto self
 or not-self.
 'Shedding everything' means not holding onto past, present, or future:
 Awareness doesn't head forward or back, and yet you can't say that it's
 taking a stance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yavadeva ñanamattaya patissatimattaya anissito ca viharatina ca kiñci loke

\begin_layout Standard
'Simply mindful and aware, the mind remains independent, not attached to
 anything in the world.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From The Craft of the Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I would like to describe the virtues of the arahants, those who have
 gained complete insight into the world, abandoning it once and for all.
 Though their aggregates (physical and mental activities) may still appear
 to the world, they are pure aggregates, absolutely free from both good
 and evil, because the mind doesn't claim possession of them.
 The mind is untouched by the behavior of the aggregates.
 The ten fetters have been disbanded completely and no longer entangle the
 heart, which is why this state is called nibbana: liberation.
 The mind is radiant and clear; passion, aversion, and delusion can no longer
 cloud it.
 It has reached the radiance of the primal nature of the heart, to which
 nothing else can compare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once this radiance is realized, it obliterates the radiance of all three
 levels of existence, so that no state of being appears at all.
 As long as the mind has yet to gain release from defilement, it is bound
 to regard the three levels of existence as radiant and appealing.
 Once the mind reaches stream-entry, the radiance of the three levels of
 existence begins to darken and dim.
 When it reaches the level of once-returning, that radiance appears even
 dimmer; and on the level of non-returning, it appears dimmer yet, although
 it is still there.
 When arahantship is reached, the radiance of the three levels of existence
 is so dim that it has virtually vanished.
 When virtue, concentration, and discernment are gathered at the mind, and
 unawareness disbands along with the higher levels of the noble path, the
 world doesn't appear at all.
 You can't tell what features, colors, or shapes it has, or even where it
 is.
 There is only the pure brilliance of nibbana.
 All the worlds are dissolved in the moments of the path and fruition of
 arahantship.
 This brilliance is something always there, but we don't see it because
 of our own darkness and delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This very brilliance, though, can obliterate the darkness of the world so
 that only nibbana will appear.
 The radiance of nibbana obliterates the radiance of the world just as the
 light of the sun, which illumines the world of human beings and common
 animals, can obliterate at midday the light of the stars appearing in the
 sky at night.
 Another comparison is the light of the candle, which in the darkness appears
 bright to our eyes: If a burning kerosene lantern is brought near the candle,
 the candle's light will appear to dim.
 If the lantern's light is really brilliant, the light of the candle won't
 even appear.
 If we aren't observant, we may think that the candle isn't shedding any
 light at all, but actually it's giving off as much light as before, only
 now no one pays it any attention.
 So it is with the mind that has reached radiant nibbana, which obliterates
 the light of the sun and moon, and wipes from the heart the glittering
 appeal of heaven and the Brahma worlds.
 This is why nibbana is said to be zero or void: None of the three worlds
 appears as a preoccupation of the heart; the heart no longer entangles
 itself.
 It zeroes itself from the world, i.e., it no longer takes part in birth,
 aging, illness, and death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nibbana is something genuine and unchanging.
 It knows nothing of deterioration.
 It always stays as it is.
 As long as there is birth, aging, illness, and death, there will always
 be nibbana, because birthlessness comes from birth, and deathlessness lies
 buried in the very midst of dying.
 The problem, then, lies with those who don't lay the ground-work for realizing
 nibbana.Nibbana doesn't vacillate back and forth, but most people who practice
 virtue, concentration, and discernment do.
 Just like a man who is going to walk to a city but, when he gets halfway
 there, turns back: Normally he should reach the city in thirty days, but
 if he walks back and forth like this even for three years, he'll never
 get there.
 And when he doesn't reach the city, if he were then to go telling people
 that it doesn't exist, he would be making a serious mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with people who practice virtue, concentration, and discernment
 in half measures, back and forth, and — when they don't gain Awakening
 — go telling others that nibbana is null and void, that the Buddha took
 it with him when he died.
 This is very wrong.
 We can make a comparison with a field where our parents have raised rice
 and always gotten a good crop.
 If they die, and our own laziness fills their place so that we don't do
 the work, we're bound to go hungry.
 And once we're hungry, can we then say that our parents took the rice or
 the field with them? In the same way, nibbana is there, but if we don't
 assemble the causes for realizing it and then go denying its existence,
 you can imagine for yourself how much harm we're doing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we haven't yet reached or realized nibbana, there's nothing extraordinary
 about it.
 But once we have come close to nibbana, the world will appear as if full
 of vipers and masses of fire.
 The palaces and mansions of heavenly beings, if you can see them, will
 look like the hovels of outcastes.
 You won't be attracted to living in them, because you've already known
 nibbana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nibbana is nothing else but this ordinary heart, freed from all the effluents
 of defilement so that it reaches its primal nature.
 The primal nature of the heart is something that doesn't take birth, age,
 grow ill, or die.
 What takes birth is the act of falling for preoccupations.
 The heart's nature is clear and shining, but unawareness keeps it clouded
 and opaque.
 Yet even on the physical level — to say nothing of the heart — if someone
 were to come along and say that the water in the ocean is clear by nature,
 that a person with any intelligence could see the ocean floor, you'd have
 a hard time trying to find anyone to believe him.
 But what he says is true.
 There are plenty of reasons why we can't see the ocean floor — the dust
 and minute particles floating in the water, the wind and the sea creatures
 that interact with the water — but if you could get someone to eliminate
 these factors so that there would be nothing but the nature of the water,
 it would be crystal clear.
 You could tell at a glance how deep or shallow the ocean was without having
 to waste your time diving and groping around.
 So it is with the heart: If our hearts are still ignorant, we shouldn't
 go groping elsewhere for nibbana.
 Only if we cleanse our own hearts will we be able to see it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People who meditate are by and large extremely prone to conjecture and speculati
on, judging nibbana to be like this or that, but actually there's nothing
 especially deep, dark, or mysterious about it.
 What makes nibbana seem mysterious is our own lack of discernment.
 Nibbana is always present, along with the world.
 As long as the world exists, there will always be nibbana.
 But if no one explores the truth of nibbana, it will appear mysterious
 and far away.
 And once we give rise to our own misunderstandings, we're bound to start
 formulating notions that nibbana is like this or like that.
 We may decide that nibbana is extinguished; that nibbana is null and void;
 that nibbana has no birth, aging, illness, or death; that nibbana is the
 self; or that nibbana is not-self.
 Actually, each of these expressions is neither right nor wrong.
 Right and wrong belong to the person speaking, because nibbana is something
 untouched by supposing.
 No matter what anyone may call it, it simply stays as it is.
 If we were to call it heaven or a Brahma world, it wouldn't object, just
 as we suppose names for "sun" and "moon": If we were to call them stars
 or clouds or worlds or jewels, whatever they really are stays as it is;
 they aren't transformed by our words.
 At the same time, they themselves don't announce that they are sun or moon
 or anything.
 They are thiti-dhamma — they simply are what they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with the pure heart that we call nibbana.
 No matter what we call it, it simply stays as it is.
 Thus we say that with nibbana there's no right and no wrong.
 Right and wrong belong to the person speaking.
 People who don't know drag out their right and wrong to talk about.
 Nibbana is something known exclusively through the heart.
 Words and deeds aren't involved.
 Our talking is merely a matter of the path.
 The result, once attained, is something completely apart.
 We thus call it release (vimutti) because it's untouched by supposing,
 attaining a nature that is pure heartwood: the heart that neither spins
 forward nor back, the heart that attains a quality that doesn't develop
 or deteriorate, come or go.
 It stays as it is — what we suppose as thiti-dhamma, free from the germs
 of defilement — our very own heart, i.e., the heart's primal nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, the heart is pure by nature, but various moods and objects — various
 preoccupations — are mixed up with it.
 Once these preoccupations are cleaned out, there you are: nibbana.
 To know nibbana clearly is nothing other than knowing how this one heart
 takes its preoccupations as itself.
 The heart by nature is one, but if it hasn't been trained by discernment,
 it tends to go streaming toward preoccupations, both within and without,
 and then we say that this state of mind differs from that state of mind,
 and so they begin to multiply until they're so many that we give up trying
 to look after them all.
 They seem many because we count each preoccupation as a state of the mind
 itself.
 The problem is that we don't understand the teachings of the ancient philosophe
rs, and so think that the mind can be called many.
 Take a simple example: Suppose a person has many jobs.
 Sometimes he sells, so he's called a merchant.
 If he also grows rice, he's called a farmer.
 If he works for the King, he's called a government official.
 If he acquires rank, he's called by his rank.
 Actually he's only one person, and none of his titles are wrong.
 They've been given to him simply in line with the work he does.
 But anyone who didn't understand would think that this man was an awful
 lot of people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another comparison: When a person is born, we call it a baby.
 When it gets older, we call it a child.
 When it gets still older, we call it a young man or a young lady, and when
 its hair gets gray and its teeth break, we call it Grandma or Gramps.
 What gives rise to all these names? One and the same person.
 So it is with the mind that is supposed to be many.
 We don't understand what the words are supposed to mean, so we go groping
 around after our own shadows.
 When this is the case, we find it hard to practice.
 We don't understand the states of mind that have been supposed into being,
 and so don't see the mind that is released, untouched by supposing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind is said to have many states, this is what is meant: Sometimes
 the mind takes on passion; this is called saraga-citta, a passionate mind.
 Sometimes it takes on irritation and aversion; this is called sadosa-citta,
 an angry mind.
 Sometimes it takes on a deluded state as itself; this is called samoha-citta,
 a deluded mind.
 These states are all on the unwise side, and are termed akusala-citta,
 unskillful mental states.
 As for the good side: vitaraga-citta, the mind has reached satisfaction
 and so its desires fade; vitadosa-citta, the mind has had enough and so
 its anger disappears; vitamoha-citta, the mind is bright and so withdraws
 from its dullness, just as the sun or moon withdraws from an eclipse and
 is bright and clear.
 These are termed kusala-citta, skillful mental states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people at this point think that there are six states to the mind, or
 even six minds.
 The true nature of the mind, though, is one.
 To count six states or six minds is to count the preoccupations; the primal
 mind is radiant.
 We take a few things to be many and so end up poor, just as when a foolish
 or poor person thinks that a thousand baht is a lot of money.
 An intelligent or rich person, though, realizes that it's just a little:
 You can spend it all in two days.
 A fool, however, would think that a thousand baht would make him rich and
 so he'll have to continue being poor.
 So it is if we see our one mind as many: We'll have to be poor because
 we'll be at our wits' end trying to train it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of the mind that's clear and one is like clean, clear water mixed
 with different colors in different bottles.
 We may call it red water, yellow water, green water, etc., but the water
 itself is still clear as it always was.
 If a fool comes along and falls for the colors, he wants to taste them
 all.
 He may drink five bottles, but they'll all be just like the first.
 If he knows beforehand that it's all the same water, he won't feel any
 desire to waste his time drinking this or that bottle.
 All he has to do is taste one bottle, and that'll be enough.
 So it is with the mind: If we realize that the mind is in charge and is
 the determining factor in all good and evil and in the attainment of nibbana,
 we won't feel any desire to go saying that the mind is like this or like
 that.
 The mind seems to be many because it gets entangled in various preoccupations,
 and when these preoccupations dye the mind, we count them as states of
 the mind itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pure nature of the heart and mind is like the sun, which shines every
 day throughout the year but is concealed by clouds during the rainy season.
 Those who don't know its nature then say that the sun isn't shining.
 This is wrong.
 Their vision can't penetrate the clouds and so they find fault with the
 sun.
 They suppose that the darkness of the clouds belongs to the sun, get stuck
 on their own supposings, and so don't reach the truth.
 The true nature of the sun is always bright, no matter what the season.
 If you don't believe me, ask an airplane pilot.
 If you go up past the clouds in an airplane on a dark rainy day, you'll
 know whether the sun is in fact dark or shining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with the mind: No matter how it may be behaving, its nature is
 one — radiant and clear.
 If we lack discernment and skill, we let various preoccupations come flowing
 into the mind, which lead it to act — sometimes wisely and sometimes not
 — and then we designate the mind according to its behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because there is one mind, it can have only one preoccupation.
 And if it has only one preoccupation, then there shouldn't be too much
 difficulty in practicing so as to know its truth.
 Even though the mind may seem to have many preoccupations, they don't come
 all at once in a single instant.
 They have to pass by one at a time.
 A good mood enters as a bad one leaves; pleasure enters, pain leaves; ingenuity
 enters, stupidity, leaves; darkness enters, brightness leaves.
 They keep trading places without let-up.
 Mental moments, though, are extremely fast.
 If we aren't discerning, we won't be able to know our own preoccupations.
 Only after they've flared up and spread to affect our words and deeds are
 we usually aware of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normally this one mind is very fast.
 Just as when we turn on a light: If we don't look carefully, the light
 seems to appear, and the darkness to disperse, the very instant we turn
 on the switch.
 This one mind, when it changes preoccupations, is that fast.
 This one mind is what leads to various states of being because our preoccupatio
ns get into the act so that we're entangled and snared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's not the case that one person will have many minds.
 Say that a person goes to heaven: He goes just to heaven.
 Even if he is to go on to other levels of being, he has to pass away from
 heaven first.
 It's not the case that he'll go to heaven, hell, and the Brahma worlds
 all at the same time.
 This goes to show that the mind is one.
 Only its thoughts and preoccupations change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preoccupations of the mind come down simply to physical and mental phenomena
 that change, causing the mind to experience birth in various states of
 being.
 Since the mind lacks discernment and doesn't know the true nature of its
 preoccupations, it gropes about, experiencing death and rebirth in the
 four modes of generation (yoni).
 If the mind has the discernment to know its preoccupations and let go of
 them all without remainder, leaving only the primal nature of the heart
 that doesn't fall for any preoccupation on the levels of sensuality, form,
 or formlessness, it will be able to gain release from suffering and stress.
 "Once the mind is fully matured by means of virtue, concentration and discernme
nt, it gains complete release from the effluents of defilement."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Khandha-kamo — desire for the five aggregates is over and done with.
 Bhava-kamo — desire for the three levels of being (the sensual plane, the
 plane of form, and the plane of formlessness) disbands and disperses.
 The three levels of being are essentially only two: the aggregate of physical
 phenomena, which includes the properties of earth, water, fire, and wind;
 and the aggregates of mental phenomena, which include feelings, labels,
 fashionings, and consciousness — in short, the phenomena that appear in
 the body and heart or, if you will, the body and mind.
 Physical phenomena are those that can be seen with the eye.
 Mental phenomena are those that can't be seen with the eye but can be sensed
 only through the heart and mind.
 Once we can distinguish these factors and see how they're related, we'll
 come to see the truth of the aggregates: They are stress, they are the
 cause of stress, they are the path.
 Once we understand them correctly, we can deal with them properly.
 Whether they arise, fade, or vanish, we won't — if we have any discernment
 — latch onto them with any false assumptions.
 The mind will let go.
 It will simply know, neutral and undisturbed.
 It won't feel any need to worry about the conditions or behavior of the
 aggregates, because it sees that the aggregates can't be straightened out.
 Even the Buddha didn't straighten out the aggregates.
 He simply let them go, in line with their own true nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart is what creates the substance of the aggregates.
 If you try to straighten out the creations, you'll never be done with them.
 If you straighten out the creator, you'll have the job finished in no time.
 When the heart is clouded with dullness and darkness, it creates aggregates
 or physical and mental phenomena as its products, to the point where the
 birth, aging, illness, and death of the aggregates become absolutely incurable
 — unless we have the wisdom to leave them alone in line with their own
 nature.
 In other words, we shouldn't latch onto them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is illustrated in the Canon, where the Buddha says in some passages
 that he is free from birth, aging, illness, and death.
 If we read further, though, we'll notice that his body grew old, ill and
 then died; his mental activity ended.
 This shows that the aggregates should be left alone.
 Whatever their nature may be, don't try to resist it or go against it.
 Keep your mind neutral and aware.
 Don't go latching onto the various preoccupations that arise, age, grow
 ill, and vanish, as pertaining to the self.
 If you can do this, you're practicing correctly.
 Aim only at the purity of the one heart that doesn't die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart clouded with dullness and darkness lacks a firm base and so drifts
 along, taking after the aggregates.
 When they take birth, it thinks that it's born; when they age, it thinks
 that it's aged; when they grow ill and disband, it gets mixed up along
 with them and so experiences stress and pain, its punishment for drifting
 along in the wake of its supposings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the mind doesn't drift in this way, there is simply the disbanding of
 stress.
 The cause of stress and the path disband as well, leaving only the nature
 that doesn't die: buddha, a mind that has bloomed and awakened.
 For the mind to bloom, it needs the fertilizer of virtue and concentration.
 For it to awaken and come to its senses, it needs discernment.
 The fertilizer of concentration is composed of the exercises of tranquillity
 and insight meditation.
 The mind then gains all-around discernment with regard to the aggregates
 — seeing the pain and harm they bring — and so shakes itself free and keeps
 its distance, which is why the term "arahant" is also translated as "one
 who is distant." In other words, the mind has had enough.
 It has had its fill.
 It's no longer flammable, i.e., it offers no fuel to the fires of passion,
 aversion, and delusion, which are now dispersed once and for all through
 the power of discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the supreme nibbana.
 Birth has been absolutely destroyed, but nibbana isn't annihilation.
 Nibbana is the name for what still remains: the primal heart.
 So why isn't it called the heart? Because it's now a heart with no preoccupatio
ns.
 Just as with the names we suppose for "tree" and "steel": If the tree is
 cut, they call it "lumber." If it's made into a house, they call it "home."
 If it's made into a place to sit, they call it a "chair." You never see
 anyone who would still call it a "tree." The same with steel: Once it's
 been made into a car or a knife, we call it a "car" or a "knife." You never
 see anyone who would still call it a "steel." But even though they don't
 call it a steel, the steel is still there.
 It hasn't run off anywhere.
 It's still steel just as it always was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with the heart when the expert craftsman, discernment, has finished
 training it: We call it nibbana.
 We don't call it by its old name.
 When we no longer call it the "heart," some people think that the heart
 vanishes, but actually it's simply the heart in its primal state that we
 call nibbana.
 Or, again it's simply the heart untouched by supposing.
 No matter what anyone may call it, it simply stays as it is.
 It doesn't take on anyone's suppositions at all.
 Just as when we correctly suppose a diamond to be a diamond: No matter
 what anyone may call it, its real nature stays as it is.
 It doesn't advertise itself as a diamond.
 It simply is what it is.
 The same with the heart: Once it gains release, it doesn't suppose itself
 to be this or that.
 It's still there.
 It hasn't been annihilated.
 Just as when we call a diamond a diamond, it's there; and when we don't
 call it anything, it's still there — it hasn't vanished or disappeared
 — so it is with the hear that is nibbana: It's there.
 If we call it a sun, a moon, heaven, Brahma world, earth, water, wind,
 fire, woman, man, or anything at all, it's still there, just as before.
 It hasn't changed in any way.
 It stays as it is: one heart, one Dhamma, free from the germs of defilement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why the truest name to suppose for it is release.
 What we call heart, mind, intellect, form, feeling, labels, mental fashionings,
 consciousness: All these are true as far as supposing goes.
 Wherever supposing is, there release can be found.
 Take a blatant example: the five aggregates.
 If you look at their true nature, you'll see that they've never said, "Look.
 We're aggregates," or "Look.
 We're the heart." So it is with the heart that's nibbana, that has reached
 nibbana: It won't proclaim itself as this or that, which is why we suppose
 it to be release.
 Once someone has truly reached release, that's the end of speaking.

From the Autobiography
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I make it a practice to wander about during the dry season every year.
 I do this because I feel that a monk who stays put in one monastery is
 like a train sitting still at HuaLampong station — and everyone knows the
 worth of a train sitting still.
 So there's no way I could stay in one place.
 I'll have to keep on the move all of my life, as long as I'm still ordained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of my companions have criticized me for being this way, and others
 have praised me, but I myself feel that it brings nothing but good.
 I've learned about the land, events, customs and religious practices in
 different areas.
 In some places it may be that I'm more ignorant than the people there;
 in other places and with other groups, it might be that I know more than
 they, so there's no way I can lose by traveling about.
 Even if I just sit still in the forest, I gain by it.
 Wherever I find the people know less than I do, I can be their teacher.
 In whatever groups I find that I know less than they do, I'm willing to
 be their student.
 Either way I profit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, living in the forest as I like to do has given me a lot
 to think about.
 1) It was a custom of the Buddha.
 He was born in the forest, attained Awakening in the forest, and totally
 entered nibbana in the forest — and yet how was he at the same time able
 to bring his virtues right into the middle of great cities, as when he
 spread his religious work to include King Bimbisara of Rajagaha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) As I see it, it's better to evade than to fight.
 As long as I'm not superhuman, as long as my skin can't ward off knives,
 bullets and spears, I'd better not live in the centers of human society.
 This is why I feel it's better to evade than to fight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People who know how to evade have a saying: 'To evade is wings; to avoid
 is a tail.' This means: A tiny chick, fresh out of the egg, if it knows
 how to evade, won't die.
 It will have a chance to grow feathers and wings and be able to survive
 on its own in the future.
 'To avoid is a tail': This refers to the tail (rudder) of a boat.
 If the person holding the rudder knows how to steer, he'll be able to avoid
 stumps and sand bars.
 For the boat to avoid running aground depends on the rudder.
 Since this is the way I see things, I prefer living in the forest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) I've come to consider the principles of nature: It's a quiet place, where
 you can observe the influences of the environment.
 Wild animals, for example, sleep differently from domesticated animals.
 This can be a good lesson.
 Or take the wild rooster: Its eyes are quick, its tail feathers sparse,
 its wings strong and its call short.
 It can run fast and fly far.
 What do these characteristics come from? I've made this a lesson for myself.
 Domesticated roosters and wild roosters come from the same species, but
 the domesticated rooster's wings are weak, its call long, its tail feathers
 lush and ungainly, its behavior different from that of the wild rooster.
 The wild rooster is the way it is because it can't afford to let down its
 guard.
 It always has to be on the alert, because danger is ever-present in the
 forest.
 If the wild rooster went around acting like a domestic rooster, the cobras
 and mongooses would make a meal of it in no time.
 So when it eats, sleeps, opens and closes its eyes, the wild rooster has
 to be strong and resilient in order to stay alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with us.
 If we spend all our time wallowing around in companionship, we're like
 a knife or a hoe stuck down into the dirt: It'll rust easily.
 But if it's constantly sharpened on a stone or a file, rust won't have
 a chance to take hold.
 Thus we should learn to be always on the alert.
 This is why I like to stay in the forest.
 I benefit from it, and learn many lessons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4) I've learned to reflect on the teachings that the Buddha taught first
 to each newly-ordained monk.
 They're very thought-provoking.
 He taught the Dhamma first, and then the Vinaya.
 He'd begin with the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, followed
 by the five basic objects of meditation: hair of the head, hair of the
 body, nails, teeth and skin.
 Then he'd give a sermon with four major points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) Make a practice of going out for alms.
 Be an asker, but not a beggar.
 Be content with whatever you are given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) Live in a quiet place, such as an abandoned house, under a projecting
 cliff face, in a cave.
 People have asked if the Buddha had any reasons for this teaching, but
 I've always been convinced that if there were no benefits to be gained
 from these places, he wouldn't have recommended them.
 Still, I wondered what the benefits were, which is why I've taken an interest
 in this matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) The Buddha taught monks to make robes from cloth that had been thrown
 away — even to the point of wearing robes made from the cloth used to wrap
 a corpse.
 This teaching made me reflect on death.
 What benefits could come from wearing the cloth used to wrap a corpse?
 For a simple answer, think for a moment about a corpse's things: They don't
 appeal to anyone.
 No one wants them — and so they hold no dangers.
 In this point it's easy enough to see that the Buddha taught us not to
 take pride in our possessions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d) The Buddha taught that we should use medicines near at hand, such as
 medicinal plants pickled in urine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These teachings of the Buddha, when I first heard them, sparked my curiosity.
 Whether or not I would benefit from following them, there was one thing
 I was sure of: that the Buddha was not the sort of person who would hold
 blindly to anything, and that he would never teach anything without good
 reason.
 So even if I wasn't totally convinced of his teachings, I should at least
 respect them.
 Or if I didn't yet have confidence in my teacher's ability, I owed it to
 him and to the traditions of the Sangha to give his teachings a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was reminded of the words of MahaKassapa, who asked to be allowed to follow
 such ascetic practices as living in the forest, eating one meal a day (going
 out for alms) and wearing robes made from thrown-away rags all of his life.
 The Buddha questioned him, 'You've already eradicated your defilements.
 What is there left for you to strive for?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MahaKassapa answered, 'I want to observe these practices, not for my own
 sake, but for the sake of those yet to come.
 If I don't follow these practices, who will they be able to take as an
 example? If a person teaches by example, the students will learn easily,
 just as when a person teaches students how to read: If he has pictures
 to go along with the text, the students will learn much more quickly.
 My observing these practices is the same sort of thing.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I thought of these words, I felt sympathy for MahaKassapa, subjecting
 himself to all sorts of hardships.
 If you were to put it in worldly terms, you could say that he was already
 a multimillionaire, deserving a soft bed and fine food, but instead he
 slept and ate on the ground, and had only coarse food to eat.
 Thinking of his example, I'd be ashamed to look for nothing more than creature
 comforts.
 As for MahaKassapa, he could have eaten fine food and lived in a beautiful
 home with no danger of his heart's being defiled.
 But — and it's not surprising — he was more concerned with benefiting those
 who came after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these things have given me food for thought ever since I was first
 ordained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of living in the forest, I've learned a lot of unusual lessons
 there.
 Sometimes I've seen death close at hand and have learned a lot of lessons
 — sometimes from seeing the behavior of animals, sometimes from talking
 to people who live there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once there was an old man who told me of the time he had gone with his wife
 to tap tree sap deep in a large forest.
 They happened to run into a bear, and a fight ensued.
 The wife was able to get up a tree in time and then called down to her
 husband, 'If you can't fight it off, lie down and play dead.
 Don't make a move.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When her husband heard this, he came to his senses and so fell back on the
 ground, lying absolutely still.
 Seeing this, the bear climbed up astride him, but then let go of him and
 simply stood looking at him.
 The old man lay there on his back, meditating on the word, 'buddho, buddho,'
 and thinking, 'I'm not going to die.
 I'm not going to die.' The bear pulled at his legs and then at his head,
 and then used its nuzzle to push him left and right.
 The old man kept his joints loose and didn't react in any way.
 After the bear had decided that the man was dead, it left.
 A moment or so later the man got up and walked home with his wife.
 His head was all battered and bloody, but he didn't die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he had finished telling me the story, he added, 'That's the way forest
 animals have to be.
 If you can't fight, you have to play dead.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hearing this, the thought occurred to me, 'No one is interested in a dead
 person.
 Since I live in the forest, I should play dead.
 Whoever praises me or attacks me, I'll have to be still — quiet in thought,
 word and deed — if I want to survive.' This can also be a good reminder
 in the way of the Dhamma: To free yourself from death, you have to play
 dead.
 This is a good lesson in maranassati, keeping death in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another time, early one morning when I was staying in the middle of a large
 forest, I took my followers out for alms.
 As we were going through the forest, I heard a mother chicken cry, 'Kataak!
 Kataak!' Since she didn't fly away, I figured she probably had some baby
 chicks, so I sent the boys to run and look.
 This frightened the chicken and she flew away over the trees.
 The boys saw a lot of baby chicks running around, but before they could
 catch them, the chicks scurried into a large pile of fallen leaves.
 There they hid themselves and lay absolutely still.
 The boys took a stick and stirred around in the leaves, but the chicks
 didn't move.
 They didn't even make a peep.
 Although the boys kept looking for a while, they couldn't find even a single
 chick.
 I knew that the chicks hadn't gone anywhere.
 They had just pretended to be fallen leaves.
 So as it turned out, of all those little tiny chicks, we couldn't catch
 a one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thinking about this, I was struck by their instincts for self-preservation,
 and how clever they were: They simply kept themselves quiet in a pile of
 fallen leaves.
 And so I made a comparison for myself: 'When you're in the wilds, then
 if you can keep your mind still like the baby chicks, you're sure to be
 safe and to free yourself from dying.' This was another good lesson.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the animals, there are other aspects of nature — such as
 trees and vines — that can set you thinking.
 Take vines, for instance.
 There are some that don't turn in any direction but right.
 Observing this, I've made it a lesson for myself.
 'If you're going to take your mind to the highest good, you'll have to
 act like the vines: i.e., always to the right, for the Buddha taught, 'Kaya-kamma
m, vaca-kammam, mano-kammam padakkhinam' — going to the right in thought,
 word and deed.
 You'll always have to go right — by keeping yourself above the defilements
 that flare up and consume the heart.
 Otherwise you'll be no match even for a vine.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some kind of trees make themselves quiet in ways we can see: We say that
 they 'sleep.' At night, they fold up their leaves.
 If you go lie under them, you'll have a clear view of the stars in the
 nighttime sky.
 But when day comes, they'll spread out their leaves and give a dense shade.
 This is a good lesson for the mind: When you sit in meditation, close only
 your eyes.
 Keep your mind bright and alert, like a tree that closes its leaves and
 thus doesn't obstruct our view of the stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you can think in this way you see the value of living in the forest.
 The mind becomes confident.
 Dhamma that you have studied — or even that you haven't — will make itself
 clear because nature is the teacher.
 It's like the sciences of the world, which every country has used to develop
 amazing powers.
 None of their inventions or discoveries came out of a textbook.
 They came because scientists studied the principles of nature, all of which
 appear right here in the world.
 As for the Dhamma, it's just like science: It exists in nature.
 When I realized this I no longer worried about studying the scriptures,
 and I was reminded of the Buddha and his disciples: They studied and learned
 from the principles of nature.
 None of them followed a textbook.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For these reasons I'm willing to be ignorant when it comes to texts and
 scriptures.
 Some kinds of trees sleep at night and are awake during the day.
 Others sleep by day and are awake by night.
 The same is true of forest animals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Living in the forest, you also learn from the vapors that each plant exudes.
 Some plants are good for your health, some are bad.
 Sometimes, for example, when I've been feverish, I've gone to sit under
 certain kinds of trees and my fever has disappeared.
 Sometimes when I've been feeling well I've gone to sit under certain kinds
 of trees and the elements in my body have become disturbed.
 Sometimes I've been hungry and thirsty, but as soon as I go sit under certain
 kinds of trees, my hunger and thirst disappear.
 Learning from trees in this way has caused me to think about the traditional
 doctors who keep a statue of a hermit on their altars.
 Those hermits never studied medical textbooks, but were able to teach about
 medicines that can cure disease because they had studied nature by training
 their minds the same way we do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar lessons can be learned from water, earth and air.
 Realizing this, I've never gotten very excited about medicines that cure
 disease, because I feel that good medicines are everywhere.
 The important point is whether or not we recognize them, and this depends
 on us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, there's another quality we need in order to take care of ourselves:
 the power of the mind.
 If we're able to keep the mind quiet, its ability to cure disease will
 be tens of times greater than that of any medicine.
 This is called dhamma-osatha: the medicine of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, I can really see that I've gained from living in forests and
 other quiet places in order to train the mind.
 One by one I've been able to cut away my doubts about the Buddha's teachings.
 And so, for this reason, I'm willing to devote myself to the duties of
 meditation until there's no more life left for me to live.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gains that come from training the mind, if I were to describe them in
 detail, would go on and on, but I'll ask to finish this short description
 here.

Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya was one of the great personalities of
 Theravada Buddhism in the twentieth century, and it is testimony to his
 vast store of past merits that his life span stretched clear across this
 century from its beginning almost to its end.
 In the course of his exemplary life this outstanding Mahathera has held
 some of the most prestigious academic and ecclesiastical posts in the country.
 Yet such honor and fame hardly touched him inwardly: at heart he always
 remained a simple monk whose greatest joy was quiet study and meditation
 at his small village temple near the town of Balangoda.
 For me it is a personal honor to be able to name Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya as my own ordination teacher, the one who brought me into
 the Sangha and guided my first steps in the life of a bhikkhu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The background story to my meeting with the Mahanayaka Thera goes back to
 the year 1971.
 At that time I was living at a Vietnamese Buddhist meditation center in
 Los Angeles.
 I had been ordained as a samanera (novice) in the Vietnamese Mahayana Order
 and was lecturing in world religions at a local university.
 One day our center received notice that a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka
 would be arriving in Los Angeles.
 We invited him to stay with us and give a series of lectures on Theravada
 Buddhism at our center.
 That Buddhist monk was none other than Ven.
 Piyadassi Nayaka Thera of Vajirarama.
 I served as Ven.
 Piyadassi's host during his stay, drove him around town over Los Angeles's
 forbidding maze of freeways, and accompanied him to the airport when it
 was time for him to leave.
 When we parted, Ven.
 Piyadassi suggested to me that some day I should come to Sri Lanka, where
 he could arrange for me to stay at a Buddhist monastery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next year the decision had crystallized in my mind to go to Asia to
 take ordination as a Theravada Buddhist monk.
 I wrote to Ven.
 Piyadassi to remind him of his invitation, and he wrote back, giving me
 the name of a senior prelate who, he said, had previously ordained Westerners.
 The name was that of Ven.
 Balangoda Ananda Maitreya.
 I wrote to the Mahanayaka Thera, telling him of my background and of my
 desire to come to Sri Lanka to ordain as a bhikkhu and to study Pali and
 Buddhism.
 The Venerable promptly replied, extending me a warm welcome and assuring
 me that he could oversee my ordination and my instruction in the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was at the end of October 1972 that I at last arrived in Sri Lanka, and
 a week later I made the trip out to Balangoda.
 I was accompanied on this trip by the late Ven.
 Baddegama Vimalavamsa Nayaka Thera, who had been my host in Colombo, and
 by Ven.
 Pimbure Sorata Nayaka Thera, in whose vehicle we traveled to Balangoda.
 Though both spoke highly of the excellent qualities of my prospective guru,
 all along the way I felt somewhat apprehensive about my impending meeting
 with the Venerable One.
 Again and again the doubts plagued my mind: Would I make my prostrations
 in the correct manner? Would I fumble hopelessly for words? Would I make
 some blunder that would immediately convince the Mahathera that I was unsuited
 for ordination as a monk?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We arrived in Balangoda in the middle of the afternoon and headed for the
 Sri Dhammananda Pirivena, where we were to meet Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya.
 As we approached the room where he was awaiting us, my mind was torn between
 a keen desire to see my chosen teacher and the anxious thoughts that played
 havoc with my good intentions.
 My anxiety increased even to the point where I wanted to flee — back to
 the familiar smog-drenched roadways of Los Angeles, which I had left a
 few months earlier — abandoning this "noble quest for the Dhamma" as a
 foolish figment of youthful idealism.
 But there was no turning back: the two Nayaka Theras had already entered
 the room, and now it was my turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as I crossed the threshold and set eyes on the Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya, all my fears were dispelled like the morning mist before
 the rising sun.
 It was no stern, cold, ascetic glare that met my questioning eyes, but
 a bright radiant kindness, a natural simplicity, and a twinkling immediacy
 of presence which instantly put me at ease.
 At once I felt delighted that my kamma, and the good offices of Ven.
 Piyadassi, had brought me into contact with such a luminous being.
 My fears of bowing in the wrong way were also laid to rest.
 As soon as I came up close to the Mahanayaka Thera to begin my bow, he
 waved me towards a chair, as though he thought he should not impose Asian
 monastic formalities on a visitor from urbane America.
 Of course, I did not accept his invitation but made the customary triple
 prostration — with no fear at all that a pair of censorious eyes would
 be watching to see where I would trip up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later that afternoon, after tea and light talk, the two Nayaka Theras who
 had so kindly brought me out to Balangoda departed, and the Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya, a few novices, a lay attendant, and the American postulant
 piled into the quaint, ancient British-made car that was to take us to
 Sri Nandaramaya, the Mahanayaka Thera's temple in Udumulla, a village about
 3 km from Balangoda town.
 A light rain had started to fall, and after several stopovers along the
 way we entered the rough dirt road that led to Udumulla.
 By this time darkness was thickly descending, and thus, when we reached
 the temple, I could barely see farther than the small area illuminated
 by the kerosene lantern I was given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the next few days I had the chance to explore the full extent of Sri
 Nandaramaya.
 Earlier, while living in the U.S., I had heard worrisome reports about the
 comfortable living standards that Sri Lankan prelates were inclined to
 stake out for themselves.
 Though Ven.
 Piyadassi had already warned me that I must be ready to "rough it" at Udumulla,
 on my first morning there I had still been half-expecting a monastic palace
 to emerge from the mist.
 Well, one quick walk around the Mahanayaka Thera's temple was enough to
 pull the ground away from any bold generalizations about luxury-loving
 prelates.
 The temple was, in a sense, an external reflection of the Mahanayaka Thera's
 own character: simple, stripped to bare essentials, without ostentation,
 revealing an almost complete indifference, even oblivion, to the perks
 and privileges of high office.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main part of the temple, the "pansala" or monks' residence, was a simple
 wooden structure with tile roof, mud-and-cowdung floor, a plain verandah
 with a chipped wooden lattice facade, and a few cells for the monks.
 These contained little more than beds, book cases, and wooden tables; it
 was in one of these that Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya was living at the time.
 A primitive alms hall in the back could accommodate about ten monks, none
 very comfortably.
 Behind the temple was a hill on which two "kutis" or cottages had recently
 been built and were still drying out: one, lower down on the hill, was
 a wattle-and-daub structure intended for myself; the other, higher up,
 was made of concrete and was to be occupied by the Mahanayaka Thera.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the next few months I came to learn, as a hard lesson, that the diet
 at Sri Nandaramaya conformed to the same austere standards as the temple's
 physical structures.
 No gourmet's delight here! Breakfast generally consisted of thin rice gruel
 (lunu kenda) with a few cream crackers and occasionally a couple of small
 bananas.
 The midday meal was usually country rice with a dhal curry and a single
 vegetable, and a local confection for dessert.
 Occasionally a piece of papaya provided a special treat.
 For a year before I came to Sri Lanka I had already been a vegetarian,
 but the fare at Udumulla was still too spartan for my needs.
 I soon enough learned how to go on alms round to the surrounding hamlets,
 where I collected a variety of nutritious curries and could supply the
 monks in the temple with my surplus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For two and a half years (1972-75) I lived with Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya at Sri Nandaramaya.
 During this happy period I received regular instruction from him in Pali,
 Suttanta, and Abhidhamma, fields in which his erudition was impeccable.
 The guidance he gave me so generously at that time has continued to benefit
 me right up to the present.
 In this early stage of my monk's life I faced considerable confusion trying
 to find the proper key to understand the Dhamma correctly.
 Western interpreters of Buddhism are often prone to invent their own versions
 of the Buddha's teachings, which they then hail as the sole valid interpretatio
n of the Dhamma.
 Without a reliable guide it is easy to get lost in the jungles of speculation
 and opinion, littered with the landmines of pride, contention, and conceit.
 During this period the Mahanayaka Thera always reminded me of the importance
 of relying on the Theravada commentarial tradition in order to understand
 the Pali Dhamma correctly.
 He implanted in my mind a profound respect for the Atthakathas and Tikas,
 the Commentaries and Subcommentaries, an attitude which inspired and guided
 my study of the Suttas and the Abhidhamma.
 Although I subsequently came to see the need to distinguish among the various
 strata in the evolution of Theravada Buddhist thought, this early advice
 from my teacher helped to steer me away from fruitless interpretations
 often rooted in little more than the pride and cleverness of the expositor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My meetings with the Mahanayaka Thera in those days were not all devoted
 to religious instruction.
 Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya was widely read, had a rich store of experience, and was
 an original thinker and writer.
 Thus every so often we would lay the books aside and he would dilate on
 his theories ranging from the origins of Christianity to the scientific
 basis for extrasensory perception.
 During this period I also discovered one of the secrets to the Venerable's
 health and vigour: long walks.
 At this time he was already 77-79 years of age, yet several times per month,
 armed with a load of books, we would make the 6 km walk from his temple
 to the Balangoda pirivena, and then, after a short break at the pirivena,
 would make another 6 km walk back to the temple.
 I myself was some fifty years his junior, but even then I had to hasten
 to keep up with him on these walks!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Writers who have eulogized the Mahanayaka Thera after his death have often
 extolled his lofty titles, his numerous writings, and his extensive missionary
 work all over the world.
 A very different image of the Mahanayaka Thera remains fixed in my mind
 as a summation of his character and attitude towards life.
 The image stems from a scene I witnessed one afternoon about 25 years ago.
 We were on our way back to Sri Nandaramaya from the pirivena, and the Venerable
 decided to stop off at the Thumbagoda temple, near the approach road to
 Udumulla.
 He often liked to stop off here on his way back to his own temple — to
 rest, enjoy a cup of tea, and chat with the incumbent monk, a close friend
 of his for many years.
 On this particular afternoon the weather had been cool and rainy, so the
 break was especially welcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sat out on the verandah sipping my tea while the Mahanayaka Thera and
 his friend spoke inside.
 About an hour later they still had not emerged.
 Darkness was starting to set in and the rain clouds were rumbling, so I
 thought I should remind the Venerable of the time.
 I did not find the Mahanayaka in the main part of the temple, though the
 incumbent monk was milling about there, so I went all the way back into
 the kitchen.
 There I found him, sitting on a small stool next to the fireplace, chatting
 amiably with the temple servant, who was sitting on a mat on the ground.
 I could not help being struck by the utter simplicity, the lack of any
 sense of self-importance, the utterly unpretentious kindness of this man
 — the highest ranking prelate in the Amarapura Nikaya, the most learned
 scholar-monk on the island, yet never thinking for a moment he was too
 good or too high to sit almost on the same level with a simple kitchen
 hand, extending to him the same gracious friendliness that he extended
 to everyone else who sought his guidance and help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years I did not have frequent personal contact with Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya.
 He had spent long periods abroad, and when he was in Sri Lanka he was residing
 at Balangoda while I have been in Kandy, looking after the late Ven.
 Nyanaponika Mahathera and supervising the publications programme of the
 Buddhist Publication Society.
 But from the reports of newspapers and friends and from my own occasional
 meetings with him I often heard of the Venerable's successful missions
 abroad.
 I was especially glad to know that he had become a virtual "Sangha father"
 to the Western Bhikkhu Sangha based at the Amaravati and Chithurst monasteries
 in Britain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was fortunate to have three delightful meetings with the Mahanayaka Thera
 in the past three years.
 During the Vassa of 1995, which he spent at Giriulla, about halfway between
 Kandy and Colombo, I went out with a friend to visit him.
 I was both amused and impressed to see how assiduously he had taken to
 the computer, a skill he had learned at the ripe age of 94 and in which
 he had become quite adept.
 It was altogether in character for him not to think he was too old to learn
 something new, and to achieve an effortless mastery over it in minimal
 time.
 We even exchanged views on the relative merits of different software programmes
 and computers.
 At this meeting he told us he had a strong intuition that he would live
 to the age of 105.
 So sure was I that his intuition was correct that when I heard he was seriously
 ill in Colombo this past July I had no doubt that he would recover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second meeting took place almost exactly a year before his death.
 With a group of friends I had gone to Colombo on Ven.
 Piyadassi's 83rd birthday to share a birthday dana with him.
 I had earlier heard that Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya was staying at his temple at Maharagama and I wanted to
 visit him too.
 I had a special reason for this visit.
 About a month earlier a group of Buddhists from Malaysia had called on
 me and presented me with a two-volume work they had published for free
 distribution: "The Great Chronicle of Buddhas," by the Ven.
 Mingun Sayadaw of Myanmar.
 The work describes in detail the spiritual path of the bodhisattva, and
 since I knew Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya followed this ideal the thought occurred to me to present
 him with this pair of books.
 Fortunately we were able to meet him and I could offer him the books, which
 he started perusing even before we concluded our meeting.
 Just a few months earlier he had received Myanmar's highest ecclesiastical
 honor, the title of "Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru," and he told us about his
 trip to that country to receive the honor.
 When we left his room we found to our astonishment a line of about thirty
 people waiting to see him.
 It seemed to us his room was like a doctor's office, but these people,
 waiting so patiently, were seeking medicine for the spirit, not for the
 body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My third meeting with the Mahanayaka Thera took place only a month before
 his death.
 On a trip down to Colombo, this time to visit an ailing Ven.
 Piyadassi, I had heard that Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya was also in the hospital, warded on account of a buildup
 of phlegm in the lungs that had developed during a trip to Taiwan and Thailand
 that he made in May.
 Together with a few friends I went to the hospital to see him.
 On our arrival there we were told that the Venerable had been discharged
 that same morning and was now at his temple in Maharagama.
 We set out for the temple at once and found him in apparent good health,
 though still complaining of "a little phlegm trouble." He told us about
 his trip and gave us an illuminating explanation of his approach to insight
 meditation.
 We expected him to be returning to Balangoda before the rains retreat,
 and I was hoping to go out to Balangoda after the rainy season to spend
 a longer period with him at his temple.
 He seemed so fit, so clear-minded, so full of vitality that we never doubted
 he would live on for at least a few more years.
 Yet that "little phlegm trouble" was to become the agent that, only one
 month later, would snatch him from our midst, leaving us with only the
 pain of loss and the consolation of pleasant memories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I drove out to Balangoda with some friends to attend the Venerable's
 cremation, when our southbound road linked up with the cross-country road
 leading to Balangoda, I had a surprise that brought a knot to my throat
 and tears of joy to my eyes.
 All along the road for about 100 km, from Avissawela onwards, every town
 was decked out in yellow and orange banners inscribed with words of homage
 to the Mahanayaka Thera.
 Almost every house and shop flew a yellow flag or strips of yellow cloth.
 Balangoda itself was ablaze with yellow and orange banners, some with pictures
 of Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya, most with inscriptions.
 When I saw this, and when I saw the long lines of people that turned out
 to pay final respects to the body, and the huge crowd that attended the
 cremation, I realized how powerful an impact this simple monk had made
 on the people of this nation: on people of all communities, ethnic groups,
 and religions, whom he always regarded without the least discrimination.
 Though gross materialism has made its inroads here with alarming force,
 though a futile ethnic conflict has raged on for over fifteen years, though
 crime and social problems escalate daily, the massive public expression
 of solidarity with this humble monk showed where peoples' sympathies and
 affections really lie — when they are given the right example.

Ven.
 Ananda Maitreya was born in Kirindigala, Balangoda, on August 24, 1896,
 and entered the Bhikkhu Sangha [Order of Monks] at the age of 15 [as a
 novice, not a bhikkhu or fully ordained monk].
 He held the post of Vice Chancellor of Vidyodaya University and was appointed
 as the first President of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Mahasangha Sabha in 1969.
 In recognition of his laudable service at the Chattha Sangayana, the [Sixth]
 Great Council held in Myanmar in 1954, Myanmar conferred on him the title
 "Agga Mahapandita" [Chief Great Scholar].
 Last year, Myanmar conferred on him the highest Sangha title, Abhidhaja
 Maharatthaguru [roughly, Most Eminent Great Spiritual Teacher of the Nation],
 which is equivalent to Sangharaja [King of the Monastic Order] in honor
 of his unique service to the Sasana [the Buddhist religion].

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Bhikkhu Bodhi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practice of giving is universally recognized as one of the most basic
 human virtues, a quality that testifies to the depth of one's humanity
 and one's capacity for self-transcendence.
 In the teaching of the Buddha, too, the practice of giving claims a place
 of special eminence, one which singles it out as being in a sense the foundatio
n and seed of spiritual development.
 In the Pali suttas we read time and again that "talk on giving" (danakatha)
 was invariably the first topic to be discussed by the Buddha in his "graduated
 exposition" of the Dhamma.
 Whenever the Buddha delivered a discourse to an audience of people who
 had not yet come to regard him as their teacher, he would start by emphasizing
 the value of giving.
 Only after his audience had come to appreciate this virtue would he introduce
 other aspects of his teaching, such as morality, the law of kamma, and
 the benefits in renunciation, and only after all these principles had made
 their impact on the minds of his listeners would he expound to them that
 unique discovery of the Awakened Ones, the Four Noble Truths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strictly speaking, giving does not appear in its own right among the factors
 of the Noble Eightfold Path, nor does it enter among the other requisites
 of enlightenment (bodhipakkhiya dhamma).
 Most probably it has been excluded from these groupings because the practice
 of giving does not by its own nature conduce directly and immediately to
 the arising of insight and the realization of the Four Noble Truths.
 Giving functions in the Buddhist discipline in a different capacity.
 It does not come at the apex of the path, as a factor constituent of the
 process of awakening, but rather it serves as a basis and preparation which
 underlies and quietly supports the entire endeavor to free the mind from
 the defilements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, though giving is not counted directly among the factors of
 the path, its contribution to progress along the road to liberation should
 not be overlooked or underestimated.
 The prominence of this contribution is underscored by the place which the
 Buddha assigns to giving in various sets of practices he has laid down
 for his followers.
 Besides appearing as the first topic in the graduated exposition of the
 Dhamma, the practice of giving also figures as the first of the three bases
 of meritorious deeds (punnakiriyavatthu), as the first of the four means
 of benefiting others (sangahavatthu), and as the first of the ten paramis
 or "perfections." The latter are the sublime virtues to be cultivated by
 all aspirants to enlightenment, and to the most exalted degree by those
 who follow the way of the Bodhisatta aimed at the supreme enlightenment
 of perfect Buddhahood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarded from another angle, giving can also be identified with the personal
 quality of generosity (caga).
 This angle highlights the practice of giving, not as the outwardly manifest
 act by which an object is transferred from oneself to others, but as the
 inward disposition to give, a disposition which is strengthened by outward
 acts of giving and which in turn makes possible still more demanding acts
 of self-sacrifice.
 Generosity is included among the essential attributes of the sappurisa,
 the good or superior person, along with such other qualities as faith,
 morality, learning and wisdom.
 Viewed as the quality of generosity, giving has a particularly intimate
 connection to the entire movement of the Buddha's path.
 For the goal of the path is the destruction of greed, hate and delusion,
 and the cultivation of generosity directly debilitates greed and hate,
 while facilitating that pliancy of mind that allows for the eradication
 of delusion.

The present Wheel publication has been compiled in order to explore in greater
 depth this cardinal Buddhist virtue, the practice of giving, which in writings
 on applied Buddhism is so often taken for granted that it is usually passed
 over without comment.
 In this issue four practicing Buddhists of today, all of whom combine textual
 knowledge of the Buddha's teachings with a personal commitment to the path,
 set forth their understanding of the various aspects of giving and examine
 it in relation to the wider body of Dhamma practice.

\begin_layout Standard
Giving (dana) is one of the essential preliminary steps of Buddhist practice.
 When practiced in itself, it is a basis of merit or wholesome kamma.
 When coupled with morality, concentration and insight, it leads ultimately
 to liberation from samsara, the cycle of repeated existence.
 Even those who are well-established on the path to emancipation continue
 to practice giving as it is conducive to wealth, beauty and pleasure in
 their remaining lifetimes.
 Bodhisattas complete the danaparami or perfection of giving to the ultimate
 degree by happily donating their limbs and their very lives to help other
 beings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like all good deeds, an act of giving will bring us happiness in the future,
 in accordance with the kammic law of cause and effect taught by the Buddha.
 Giving yields benefits in the present life and in lives to come whether
 or not we are aware of this fact, but when the volition is accompanied
 by understanding, we can greatly increase the merits earned by our gifts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount of merit gained varies according to three factors: the quality
 of the donor's motive, the spiritual purity of the recipient, and the kind
 and size of the gift.
 Since we have to experience the results of our actions, and good deeds
 lead to good results and bad deeds to bad results, it is sensible to try
 to create as much good kamma as possible.
 In the practice of giving, this would mean keeping one's mind pure in the
 act of giving, selecting the worthiest recipients available, and choosing
 the most appropriate and generous gifts one can afford.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Factor of Volition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The volition of the donor before, during and after the act of generosity
 is the most important of the three factors involved in the practice of
 giving: "If we have no control over our minds we will not choose proper
 gifts, the best recipient..., we will be unable to prepare them properly.
 And we may be foolish enough to regret having made them afterwards."1 Buddhist
 teaching devotes special attention to the psychological basis of giving,
 distinguishing among the different states of mind with which one may give.
 A fundamental distinction is made between acts of giving that lack wisdom
 and those that are accompanied by wisdom, the latter being superior to
 the former.
 An example of a very elementary kind of giving would be the case of a young
 girl who places a flower on the household shrine simply because her mother
 tells her to do so, without having any idea of the significance of her
 act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generosity associated with wisdom before, during and after the act is the
 highest type of giving.
 Three examples of wise giving are: giving with the clear understanding
 that according to the kammic law of cause and effect, the generous act
 will bring beneficial results in the future; giving while aware that the
 gift, the recipient and the giver are all impermanent; and giving with
 the aim of enhancing one's efforts to become enlightened.
 As the giving of a gift takes a certain amount of time, a single act of
 giving may be accompanied by each of these three types of understanding
 at a different stage in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most excellent motive for giving is the intention that it strengthens
 ones efforts to attain Nibbana.
 Liberation is achieved by eliminating all the mental defilements (kilesa),
 which are rooted in the delusion of a controlling and lasting "I." Once
 this illusion is eradicated, selfish thoughts can no longer arise.
 If we aspire to ultimate peace and purity by practicing generosity, we
 will be developing the dana parami, the perfection of giving, building
 up a store of merit that will bear its full fruit with our attainment of
 enlightenment.
 As we progress towards that goal, the volition involved in acts of giving
 will assist us by contributing towards the pliancy of the mind, an essential
 asset in developing concentration and wisdom, the prime requisites of liberatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ariyas — noble ones, those who have attained any of the four stages of holiness
 — always give with pure volition because their minds function on the basis
 of wisdom.
 Those below this level sometimes give carelessly or disrespectfully, with
 unwholesome states of mind.
 The Buddha teaches that in the practice of giving, as in all bodily and
 verbal conduct, it is the volition accompanying the act that determines
 its moral quality.
 If one is offering something to a monk, doing so without adopting a respectful
 manner would not be proper.
 Throwing a coin to a beggar in order to get rid of him would also be considered
 a defilement of giving.
 One should think carefully about the relevance and the timing of a gift
 for it to bring the best results.
 A gift given through an intermediary — for example, having a servant give
 food to a monk rather than giving it by one's own hand — also detracts
 from the value of the gift.
 When one gives without realizing that one must experience the results of
 one's deeds, an act of giving again diminishes in meritorious potency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one only plans on giving a donation but does not fulfill one's plan,
 the merit earned will be very slight.
 Thus we should always follow up our intentions of generosity expeditiously,
 unless something intervenes to prevent our doing so.
 If, after having given a gift, we should subsequently regret our action,
 much of the merit of the deed will be lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moral person gives politely and respectfully.
 Whether the gift is spontaneous or planned, he or she will make sure that
 the timing and contents of the gift are appropriate for the receiver.
 Many housewives in Buddhist countries regularly invite a few monks to their
 homes to receive almsfood early in the day.
 Before feeding the family, these women always offer the food to the bhikkhus
 with their own hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might contribute to a certain cause from fear that friends would disapprove
 if one did not give.
 Giving in response to such social pressures will have weak, though still
 beneficial, results.
 Charitable actions undertaken to gain a good reputation are also selfish
 and hence not a very valuable kind of giving.
 Nor can it be praiseworthy when one gives merely to return a favor or in
 expectation of a reward.
 The former is like repaying a debt, the latter analogous to offering a
 bribe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Recipient of Gifts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purity of the recipient is another factor which helps determine the
 kammic fruitfulness of a gift.
 The worthier the receiver, the greater the benefits that will come to the
 donor; hence it is good to give to the holiest people available.
 The Buddha teaches that the worthiest recipients of gifts are the ariyas,
 the noble ones, such as the Buddha himself and those of his disciples who
 have reached supramundane paths and fruits; for it is their purity of mind,
 attained by wisdom, that makes the act of giving capable of yielding abundant
 benefits.
 Therefore, to earn the maximum merit, we should give as much as we can,
 and as often as possible, to the noble ones.
 Gifts to a bhikkhu who strives for the state of a noble one, or to a Buddhist
 meditator who lives by the Five Precepts, will also yield bountiful results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When ariyas accept offerings, they do so to provide an opportunity for the
 donor to earn merit.
 Non-returners and Arahats in particular, who have attained the two highest
 stages of sanctity, have eliminated desire for sense objects.
 Thus when they are given gifts their minds remain detached from the objects
 presented and are filled with compassion for the giver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The story of Sivali in the Dhammapada Commentary2 is an example of the great
 merit which even a small gift can yield when presented to the Sangha led
 by the Buddha.
 At the time of Vipassi Buddha, the citizens of a country were competing
 with their king to see who could make the greatest offering to the Buddha
 and Sangha.
 The citizens had obtained everything for their offering except fresh honey,
 and they sent out messengers, each with plenty of money, to buy the missing
 ingredient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of these men met a villager who happened to be bringing a newly harvested
 honeycomb into the city for sale.
 The messenger was only able to buy it from the peasant when he had offered
 his entire allowance of a thousand pieces of money, which was far more
 than a single honeycomb was worth.
 The villager said: "Are you crazy?...
 This honey isn't worth a farthing but you offer me a thousand pieces of
 money for it.
 What is the explanation for this?" The other man told him that the honey
 was worth so much to him because it was the final item on the menu for
 the citizens' offering to the Buddha.
 The peasant spontaneously replied, "If that is the case, I will not sell
 it to you for a price; if I may receive the merit of the offering, I will
 give it to you." The citizens were impressed with the faith of this man
 who so readily gave up a windfall and enthusiastically agreed that he should
 receive the merit of the offering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this simple gift at the time of the Vipassi Buddha, the villager
 was reborn numerous times in celestial planes and the became the prince
 who inherited the throne of Benares.
 In his final lifetime, he became the Elder Sivali and attained Arahatship
 as a disciple of the present Buddha.
 Even after that, his gift of the honeycomb continued to bear fruit.
 To honor the one who had made the sweet gift aeons before, the gods provided
 lodging and food for the Buddha and five hundred of his monks, including
 Sivali, when for several days they had been walking along a deserted road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practice of giving is also beneficial when directed to someone who is
 not spiritually advanced.
 If the donor's intention is good, then even though the receiver is immoral,
 the donor will earn merit and further, by his act of giving, he will strengthen
 within himself his own disposition to renunciation.
 A gift mentally offered to the noble Sangha but physically presented to
 a monk who is morally corrupt will still bear great fruit.
 To be sure, we should not pretend that a bad person is good, but we must
 be most careful of our own attitude while giving, as our attitude is the
 factor over which we have most control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Objects to be Given
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third factor involved in giving is the gift itself, which can be either
 material or immaterial.
 Dhamma-dana, the gift of the noble teachings, is said by the Buddha to
 excel all other gifts (Dhammapada, 354).
 Those who expound his teachings — monks who preach sermons or recite from
 the Tipitaka, teachers of meditation — frequently share the Truth, thus
 practicing the highest kind of generosity.
 Those of us who are not qualified to teach the Dhamma can give the gift
 of the Dhamma in other ways.
 We can donate Dhamma books or pay for the translation or publication of
 a rare or new manuscript propagating the Buddha-Word.
 We can discuss the Dhamma informally and encourage others to keep precepts
 or to take up meditation.
 We might write an explanation of some aspect of the Dhamma for the benefit
 of others.
 Giving cash or labor to a meditation center or helping support a meditation
 teacher can also be considered the gift of the Dhamma, as the purpose of
 the center and the teacher is the transmission of the Buddha's teaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common type of gift is material things.
 A material object need not have a high monetary value for it to bring great
 results, as the story of Sivali and the honeycomb illustrates.
 If a poor man gives a monk the cup of rice that was to be his only food
 for the day, the man is making a great donation which may bear abundant
 fruit, while if a prosperous merchant, knowing in advance that the monk
 was coming for alms, were to give the same small portion of rice, he would
 reap meager fruits.
 We should try to give things whose quality is at least as good as those
 we use ourselves, like the people of Burma, who buy the best fruits on
 the market as gifts for the monks although these fruits are much too expensive
 for them to consume themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gifts to the Sangha may consist of food, robes, medicine or monasteries,
 each of which has a wide range.
 The limits are set by the rules of the Vinaya to keep the Bhikkhu Sangha
 pure and strong.
 Lay people who understand the monks' rules can earn vast merit by donating
 the proper things at the proper time to the order of monks and nuns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A story about Visakha, the Buddha's chief woman lay disciple, offers a delightfu
l illustration of the results of large-scale charity.3 When Visakha was to
 be married, elaborate preparations and gifts were arranged by her father.
 He gave her five hundred cartloads each of money, of gold, silver and copper
 implements.
 Then he decided that she must also take cattle with her.
 He gave orders to his men to allow out of their pen just as many animals
 as would fill a particular lane.
 When the cows has filed out and stood close together in that road, he had
 the corral closed, saying, "These cattle are enough for my daughter." However,
 after the gate had been latched securely, powerful bulls and milk cows
 jumped over the barrier to join the animals going with Visakha.
 Her father's servants could not keep them inside no matter how hard they
 tried.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these cattle came to Visakha because, in a former lifetime long ago
 at the time of the Buddha Kassapa, she had given a generous gift of five
 kinds of dairy products to a company of 20,000 monks and novices.
 As the youngest of the seven daughters of King Kiki of Benares, she continued
 to urge the monks to take more milk, curds, ghee, etc., even when they said
 they had eaten enough.
 That gift earned her the merit of having such a large number of cattle
 go along with her at her marriage in the lifetime when she was Visakha,
 and no one could prevent this merit from bearing its fruit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Material gifts of a religious nature would include contributions towards
 the erection of a new temple or shrine, gold leaf to help gild the umbrella
 of a shrine, or the purchase of a Buddha statue for a temple.
 The recipients of such gifts are the general public — whoever comes to
 the temple or worships before the Buddha image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mundane gifts to the citizens of one's town would include donations to various
 welfare organizations, a contribution to a hospital or public library,
 keeping a neighborhood park neat and clean.
 If one does not merely contribute funds for such projects but provides
 physical labor as well, the kammic results will be even greater.
 Gifts of this sort can be quite meritorious if preceded, accompanied and
 followed by pure mental volitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Perfection of Giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a mode of giving which completely disregards the qualities of the
 recipient and even the mundane fruits of the merit acquired by giving.
 Such generosity springs from the motive of renunciation, the thought of
 eliminating one's attachment to one's possessions, and thus aims at giving
 away the dearest and most difficult gifts.
 Bodhisattas give in this manner whenever the opportunity presents itself,
 strictly in order to fulfill the danaparami, the "perfection of giving,"
 which is the first of the ten perfections they must cultivate to the highest
 degree in order to attain Buddhahood.
 A Bodhisatta's work to complete the perfection of giving demands much more
 of him than other beings could emulate.
 Many Jataka tales relate how the Bodhisatta who was to become the Buddha
 Gotama gave things away with absolutely no thought of himself or of the
 mundane benefits that might follow.
 A Bodhisatta's only concern in practicing generosity is to fulfill the
 requirements for Buddhahood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Basket of Conduct4 contains ten stories of the Bodhisatta's former lives.
 In one of these lifetimes he was a brahman named Sankha who saw a Paccekabuddha
, or non-teaching enlightened one, walking barefoot on a desert path.
 Sankha thought to himself, "Desiring merit, seeing one eminently worthy
 of a gift of faith, if I do not give him a gift, I will dwindle in merit."
 So the brahman, who had a very delicate constitution, presented his sandals
 to the Paccekabuddha even though his own need for them was greater (Division
 I, Story 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another time the Bodhisatta was a great emperor named Maha-Sudassana.
 He had criers proclaim several times every day, in thousands of places
 throughout his empire, that anyone who wanted anything would be given it
 if he just came there and asked.
 "If there came a mendicant beggar, whether by day or by night, receiving
 whatever goods he wanted, he went away with hands full." Maha-Sudassana
 gave with completely openhanded generosity, "without attachment, expecting
 nothing in return, for the attainment of Self-Awakening" (I,4).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Bodhisatta must give more difficult gifts than material goods to fulfill
 the highest form of the perfection of generosity.
 He must freely give the parts of his body, his children, his wife, and
 even his own life.
 As King Sivi, our Bodhisatta plucked out both his eyes with his bare hands
 and gave them to Sakka, the king of the gods.
 Sakka had come to Sivi in the guise of a blind old man, just to provide
 him with the opportunity to make this remarkable gift.
 Sivi did this with no hesitation prior to the act, nor with any reluctance
 during the act, nor with any hint of regret afterwards.
 He said that this gift was made "for the sake of Awakening itself.
 The two eyes were not disagreeable to me.
 Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave my eyes" (I,8).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Prince Vessantara, the Bodhisatta gave the auspicious, powerful royal
 elephant to the people of a rival kingdom merely because they had requested
 it.
 As a result of this liberality, he and his wife and two small children
 were banished to a remote mountain.
 They lived there in the forest, Vessantara tending his son and daughter
 in their hut while his wife spent the days gathering the wild fruits on
 which they lived.
 One day a traveler chanced by and asked the Bodhisatta to give him the
 children.
 Vessantara gave them away without any hesitation at all.
 Later he gave away his virtuous wife too.
 "Neither child was disagreeable to me, the Lady Maddi was not disagreeable.
 Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave away those who were dear"
 (I, 9).
 It should be noted that at that time, a man's children and wife were generally
 considered his property.
 Ages before, the Lady Maddi had aspired to be the wife of the Bodhisatta
 and to share whatever trials he had to undergo along the path to Buddhahood.
 The result of her own kamma complemented Prince Vessanatara's volition
 and led to her being given away.
 Their children must also have been experiencing the results of their own
 past deeds when they had to leave their parents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another time the Bodhisatta took birth as a wise hare.
 That existence came to an end when, joyously, he jumped into a fire after
 inviting a famished brahman (again, Sakka in disguise) to eat him roasted.
 Because of the purity of the Bodhisatta's mind while making this highest
 gift of his entire body and life, the blazing fire did not hurt him as
 it burned his flesh.
 In relating the story he said that, in fact, the fire had calmed him and
 brought him peace as if it had been cool water, because he had accomplished
 the complete perfection of giving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ultimate Goal of Giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the Buddhist path is emancipation from the suffering of repeated
 existence in samsara.
 The Buddha taught that uprooting ignorance and the mental defilements it
 nurtures will bring us to Nibbana, the utter cessation of suffering.
 Unwholesome mental tendencies make us cling to what we mistakenly take
 to be our "selves," they keep us struggling to satisfy our insatiable sense
 desires with objects that are inherently transitory and thus unsatisfying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha said that the practice of giving will aid us in our efforts to
 purify the mind.
 Generous gifts accompanied by wholesome volition help to eradicate suffering
 in three ways.
 First, when we decide to give something of our own to someone else, we
 simultaneously reduce our attachment to the object; to make a habit of
 giving can thus gradually weaken the mental factor of craving, one of the
 main causes of unhappiness.
 Second, giving accompanied by wholesome volition will lead to happy future
 births in circumstances favorable to encountering and practicing the pure
 Buddha Dhamma.
 Third, and most important, when giving is practiced with the intention
 that the mind becomes pliant enough for the attainment of Nibbana, the
 act of generosity will help us develop virtue, concentration and wisdom
 (sila,samadhi,pañña) right in the present.
 These three stages make up the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path, and perfecting
 the path leads to the extinction of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we give in the hope of winning luxury in future lives, we may attain
 our aim providing that we adhere to the principles of virtuous conduct.
 According to the Buddha, however, the motivation of working for liberation
 is far superior to that of aiming at mundane happiness in future births.
 This is because a gift made with the desire for pleasure is accompanied
 in part by the unwholesome psychological root craving (tanha).
 The merits earned by such gifts are exhausted in transient pleasure, and
 such mundane happiness keeps us revolving in the round of rebirth, which
 in the deepest sense is always dukkha, subject to suffering.
 Giving associated with craving cannot contribute to the one form of happiness
 that does not perish, release from the round, which comes only with the
 full elimination of craving.
 Gifts untainted by craving and attachment can only be made during a Buddha
 Sasana, the period when the teachings of a Buddha are available.
 So when we give now, during such a time, we should do so with the aim of
 putting an end to craving.
 With the end of craving, suffering ceases, and that is liberation.

Giving in the Pali Canon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Lily de Silva
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dana, giving, is extolled in the Pali canon as a great virtue.
 It is, in fact, the beginning of the path to liberation.
 When the Buddha preaches to a newcomer he starts his graduated sermon with
 an exposition on the virtues of giving (danakatha, Vin.i,15,18).
 Of the three bases for the performance of meritorious deeds (punnakiriyavatthu)
, giving is the first, the other two being virtue and mental culture (A.iv,241).
 It is also the first of the ten paramita perfected by a Buddha.
 Therefore, on the march towards liberation as an arahant or a Buddha, one
 initially has to practice dana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Function of Giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giving is of prime importance in the Buddhist scheme of mental purification
 because it is the best weapon against greed (lobha), the first of the three
 unwholesome motivational roots (akusalamula).
 Greed is wrapt up with egoism and selfishness, since we hold our personalities
 and our possessions as "I" and "mine".
 Giving helps make egoism thaw: it is the antidote to cure the illness of
 egoism and greed.
 "Overcome the taint of greed and practice giving," exhorts the Devatasamyutta
 (S.i,18).
 The Dhammapada admonishes us to conquer miserliness with generosity (jine
 kadariyam danena, Dhp.
 223).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is difficult to exercise this virtue of giving proportionate to the intensity
 of one's greed and selfishness.
 As such the Devatasamyutta equates giving to a battle (danan ca yuddhan
 ca samanam ahu, S.i,20).
 One has to fight the evil forces of greed before one can make up one's
 mind to give away something dear and useful to oneself.
 The Latukikopama Sutta illustrates how a man lacking in spiritual strength
 finds it hard to give up a thing he has been used to (M.i, 449).
 A small quail can come to death when it gets entangled even in a useless
 rotten creeper.
 Though weak, a rotten creeper is a great bond for the small bird.
 But even an iron chain is not too big a bond for a strong elephant.
 Similarly, a poor wretched man of weak character would find it difficult
 to part with his shabby meager belongings, while a strong-charactered king
 will even give up a kingdom once convinced of the dangers of greed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Miserliness is not the only hindrance to giving.
 Carelessness and ignorance of the working of kamma and survival after death
 are equally valid causes (macchera ca pamada ca evam danam na diyati, S.i,18).
 If one knows the moral advantages of giving, one will be vigilant to seize
 opportunities to practice this great virtue.
 Once the Buddha said that if people only knew the value of giving as he
 does, they would not take a single meal without sharing their food with
 others (It.p,18).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Qualities of the Donor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suttas (e.g., D.i,137) employ a number of terms to describe the qualities
 of a donor.
 He is a man with faith (saddha), he has faith in the nobility of a morally
 sound life, in the teachings of kamma and survival after death.
 He believes in the possibility of the moral and spiritual perfection of
 man.
 In short, he is not a materialist, and he has faith in the Buddha, the
 Dhamma and the Sangha.
 He is not merely a giver (dayako), he is a lordly giver (danapati).
 The commentary explains the concept of "lordly giver" in the following
 words: "He who himself enjoys delicious things but gives to others what
 is not delicious is a donor who is a slave to the gifts he gives.
 He who gives things of the same quality as he himself enjoys is one who
 is like a friend of the gift.
 He who satisfies himself with whatever he can get but gives delicacies
 to others is a lordly giver, a senior and a master of the gifts given."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The donor is also described as one who keeps an open house for the needy
 (anavatadvaro).
 He is like a wellspring (opanabhuto) for recluses, brahmans, the destitute,
 wayfarers, wanderers and beggars.
 Being such a one he does meritorious deeds.
 He is munificent (muttacago) and is interested in sharing his blessings
 with others (danasamvibhagarato).
 He is a philanthropist who understands the difficulties of the poor (vadannu).
 He is open-handed and is ready to comply with another's request (payatapani).
 He is one fit to be asked from (yacayogo).
 He takes delight in distributing gifts to the needy (vossaggarato), and
 has a heart bent on giving (cagaparibhavitacitto).
 Such are the epithets used in the suttas to describe the qualities of the
 liberal-minded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A noble giver is one who is happy before, during and after giving (A.iii,336).
 Before giving he is happy anticipating the opportunity to exercise his
 generosity.
 While giving he is happy that he is making another happy by fulfilling
 a need.
 After giving he is satisfied that he has done a good deed.
 The suttas list generosity as one of the important qualities that go to
 make a gentleman (A.iv,220).
 The Buddha compares the man who righteously earns his wealth and gives
 of it to the needy to a man who has both eyes, whereas the one who only
 earns wealth but does no merit is like a one-eyed man (A.i,129-30).
 The wealthy man who enjoys his riches by himself without sharing is said
 to be digging his own grave (Sn.
 102).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Donations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practically anything useful can be given as a gift.
 The Niddesa (ND.2, 523) gives a list of fourteen items that are fit to be
 given for charity.
 They are robes, almsfood, dwelling places, medicine and other requisites
 for the sick, food, drink, cloths, vehicles, garlands, perfume, unguent,
 beds, houses and lamps.
 It is not necessary to have much to practice generosity, for one can give
 according to one's means.
 Gifts given from one's meager resources are considered very valuable (appasma
 dakkhina dinna sahassena samam mita, S.i,18; dajjappasmim pi yacito, Dhp.
 224).
 If a person leads a righteous life even though he ekes out a bare existence
 on gleanings, looks after his family according to his means, but makes
 it a point to give from his limited stores, his generosity is worth more
 than a thousand sacrifices (S.i, 19-20).
 Alms given from wealth righteously earned is greatly praised by the Buddha
 (A.iii,354; It.p.66; A.iii,45-46).
 A householder who does so is said to be one who is lucky here and hereafter.
 In the Magha Sutta of the Sutta Nipata (Sn.p.87) the Buddha highly appreciates
 Magha who says that he earns through righteous means and liberally gives
 of it to the needy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if one gives a small amount with a heart full of faith one can gain
 happiness hereafter.
 The Vimanavattha supplies ample examples.
 According to the Acamadayikavimanavatthu, the alms given consisted of a
 little rice crust, but as it was given with great devotion to an eminent
 arahant, the reward was rebirth in a magnificent celestial mansion.
 The Dakkhainavibhanga Sutta states that an offering is purified on account
 of the giver when the giver is virtuous, on account of the recipient when
 the recipient is virtuous, on account of both the giver and the recipient
 if both are virtuous, by none if both happen to be impious.
 Dhammadana, the dissemination of the knowledge of the Dhamma, is said to
 excel all other forms of giving (sabbadanam dhammadanam jinati, Dhp.354).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Anguttara Nikaya mentions five great gifts which have been held in high
 esteem by noble-minded men from ancient times (A.iv,246).
 Their value was not doubted in ancient times, it is not doubted at present,
 nor will it be doubted in the future.
 The wise recluses and brahmans had the highest respect for them.
 These great givings comprise the meticulous observance of the Five Precepts.
 By doing so one gives fearlessness, love and benevolence to all beings.
 If one human being can give security and freedom from fear to others by
 his behavior, that is the highest form of dana one can give, not only to
 mankind, but to all living beings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Donee
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suttas also describe the person to whom alms should be given (A.iii,
 41).
 Guests, travelers and the sick should be treated with hospitality and due
 consideration.
 During famines the needy should be liberally entertained.
 The virtuous should be first entertained with the first fruits of fresh
 crops.
 There is a recurrent phrase in the suttas (D.i, 137; ii,354; iii,76) describing
 those who are particularly in need of public generosity.
 They are recluses (samana), brahmans (brahmana), destitutes (kapana), wayfarers
 (addhika), wanderers (vanibbaka) and beggars (yacaka).
 The recluses and brahmans are religious persons who do not earn wages.
 They give spiritual guidance to the laity and the laity is expected to
 support them.
 The poor need the help of the rich to survive and the rich become spiritually
 richer by helping the poor.
 At a time when transport facilities were meager and amenities for travelers
 were not adequately organized, the public had to step in to help the wayfarer.
 Buddhism considers it a person's moral obligation to give assistance to
 all these types of people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha describes, with sacrificial terminology,
 three types of fires that should be tended with care and honor (A.iv,44).
 They are ahuneyyaggi,gahapataggi and dakkhineyyaggi.
 The Buddha explained that ahuneyyaggi means one's parents, and they should
 be honored and cared for.
 Gahapataggi means one's wife and children, employees and dependents.
 Dakkineyyaggi represents religious persons who have either attained the
 goal of arahantship or have embarked on a course of training for the eliminatio
n of negative mental traits.
 All these should be cared for and looked after as one would tend a sacrificial
 fire.
 According to the Maha-mangala Sutta, offering hospitality to one's relatives
 is one of the great auspicious deeds a layperson can perform (Sn.
 262-63).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
King Kosala once asked the Buddha to whom alms should be given (S.i,98).
 The Buddha replied that alms should be given to those by giving to whom
 one becomes happy.
 Then the king asked another question: To whom should alms be offered to
 obtain great fruit? The Buddha discriminated the two as different questions
 and replied that alms offered to the virtuous bears great fruit.
 He further clarified that offerings yield great fruit when made to virtuous
 recluses who have eliminated the five mental hindrances (nivarana) and
 culivated moral habits, concentration, wisdom, emancipation and knowledge
 and vision of emancipation (sila,samadhi,pañña,vimutti,vimuttinanadassana).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Sakkasamyutta (S.i,233) Sakka asked the same question from the Buddha:
 Gifts given to whom bring the greatest result? The Buddha replied that
 what is given to the Sangha bears great results.
 Here the Buddha specifies that what he means by "Sangha" is the community
 of those upright noble individuals who have entered the path and who have
 established themselves in the fruit of saintship, and who are endowed with
 morality, concentration and wisdom.
 It is important to note that "Sangha" according to the Vinaya means a sufficien
t group of monks to represent the Order of monks for various ecclesiastical
 purposes (Vin.
 i,319).
 But in the suttas "Sangha" means the four pairs of noble individuals or
 the eight particular individuals (cattari purisayugani,attha purisapuggala),
 i.e., those who are on the path to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning,
 and arahantship, and those who have obtained the fruits thereof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Magha Sutta (Sn.p.86) gives a detailed account of the virtues of the arahant
 to show to whom alms should be offered by one desiring merit.
 The Brahmanasamyutta (S.i,175) maintains that offerings bear greatest results
 when they are made to those who know their previous lives, who have seen
 heavens and hells, who have put an end to birth and who have realized ultimate
 knowledge.
 Thus the Sangha comprising morally perfect, worthy personages as described
 in the suttas constitutes the field of merit (punnakkhetta, M.i,447).
 Just as seeds sown in fertile well-watered fields yields bountiful crops,
 alms given to the virtuous established on the Noble Eightfold Path yield
 great results (A.iv,238; i,162).
 The Dhammapada maintains that fields have weeds as their blemish; lust,
 hatred, delusion and desire are the blemishes of people and therefore what
 is given to those who have eliminated those blemishes bears great fruit
 (Dhp.
 356-59).
 The results of generosity are measured more by the quality of the field
 of merit represented by the recipient than by the quantity and value of
 the gift given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv,392-95) records a fabulous alms-giving conducted
 by the Bodhisatta when he was born as a brahman named Velama.
 Lavish gifts of silver, gold, elephants, cows, carriages, etc., not to mention
 food, drink and clothing, were distributed among everybody who came forward
 to receive them.
 But this open-handed munificence was not very valuable as far as merit
 was concerned because there were no worthy recipients.
 It is said to be more meritorious to feed one person with right view, a
 stream-enterer (sotapanna), than to give great alms such as that given
 by Velama.
 It is more meritorious to feed one once-returner than a hundred stream-enterers.
 Next in order come non-returners, arahants, Paccekabuddhas and Sammasambuddhas.
 Feeding the Buddha and the Sangha is more meritorious than feeding the
 Buddha alone.
 It is even more meritorious to construct a monastery for the general use
 of the Sangha of the four quarters of all times.
 Taking refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha is better still.
 Abiding by the Five Precepts is even more valuable.
 But better still is the cultivation of metta, loving-kindness, and best
 of all, the insight into impermanence, which leads to Nibbana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Motivation for Giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suttas record various motives for exercising generosity.
 The Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv,236) enumerates the following eight motives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asajja danam deti: one gives with annoyance, or as a way of offending the
 recipient, or with the idea of insulting him.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bhaya danam deti: fear also can motivate a person to make an offering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adasi me ti danam deti: one gives in return for a favor done to oneself
 in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dassati me ti danam deti one also may give with the hope of getting a similar
 favor for oneself in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sadhu danan ti danam deti: one gives because giving is considered good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aham pacami, ime ne pacanti, na arahami pacanto apacantanam adatun ti danam
 deti: "I cook, they do not cook.
 It is not proper for me who cooks not to give to those who do not cook."
 Some give urged by such altruistic motives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imam me danam dadato kalyano kittisaddo abbhuggacchati ti danam deti: some
 give alms to gain a good reputation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cittalankara-cittaparikkarattham danam deti: still others give alms to adorn
 and beautify the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Favoritism (chanda), ill will (dosa) and delusion (moha) are also listed
 as motives for giving.
 Sometimes alms are given for the sake of maintaining a long-standing family
 tradition.
 Desire to be reborn in heaven after death is another dominant motive.
 Giving pleases some and they give with the idea of winning a happy frame
 of mind (A.iv, 236).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it is maintained in the suttas (A.iv,62) that alms should be given without
 any expectations (na sapekho danam deti).
 Nor should alms be given with attachment to the recipient.
 If one gives with the idea of accumulating things for later use, that is
 an inferior act of giving.
 If one gives with the hope of enjoying the result thereof after death,
 that is also an inferior act of giving.
 The only valid motive for giving should be the motive of adorning the mind,
 to rid the mind of the ugliness of greed and selfishness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Manner of Giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suttas (e.g., A.iii,172) lay much emphasis on the manner of giving.
 The attitude of the donor in the act of giving makes a world of difference
 for the goodwill between the donor and recipient irrespective of whether
 the gift given is big or small.
 Sakkaccam danam deti: alms should be given in such a way that the donee
 does not feel humiliated, belittled or hurt.
 The needy ask for something with a sense of embarrassment, and it is the
 duty of the donor not to make him feel more embarrassed and make his already
 heavy burden still heavier.
 Cittikatva danam deti: alms should be given with due consideration and
 respect.
 The recipient should be make to feel welcome.
 It is when a gift is given with such warmth that a cohesive mutually enriching
 friendliness emerges between the donor and donee.
 Sahattha deti: one should give with one's own hand.
 The personal involvement in the act of giving is greatly beneficial.
 This promotes rapport between the donor and donee and that is the social
 value of giving.
 Society is welded in unity with care and concern for one another when generosit
y is exercised with a warm sense of personal involvement.
 Na apaviddham deti: one should not give as alms what is only fit to be
 thrown away.
 One should be careful to give only what is useful and appropriate.
 Na anagamanaditthiko deti: one should not give in such a callous manner
 so as to make the donee not feel like coming again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giving with faith (saddhaya deti) is much extolled in the suttas (A.iii,172).
 Especially when offering alms to the clergy one should do so with due deference
 and respect, taking delight in the opportunity one has got to serve them.
 Once should also give at the proper time to meet a dire need (kalena deti).
 Such timely gifts are most valuable as they relieve the anxiety and stress
 of the supplicant.
 One should give with altruistic concerns, with the sole intention of helping
 another in difficulty (anuggahacitto danam deti).
 In the act of giving one should take care not to hurt oneself or another
 (attanan ca paran ca anupahacca danam deti).
 Giving with understanding and discretion is praised by the Buddha (viceyyadanam
 sugatappasattham).
 If a gift contributes to the well-being of the donee it is wise to give.
 But if the gift is detrimental to the welfare of the donee one should be
 careful to exercise one's discretion.
 Giving as described above is highly commended as noble giving (sappurisadana).
 More than what is given, it is the manner of giving that makes a gift valuable.
 One may not be able to afford a lavish gift, but one can always make the
 recipient feel cared for by the manner of giving.

The Value of Giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many suttas enumerate the various benefits of giving.
 Giving promotes social cohesion and solidarity.
 It is the best means of bridging the psychological gap, much more than
 the material economic gap, that exists between haves and have-nots.
 The Magha Sutta maintains that hates gets eliminated when one is established
 in generosity (Sn.
 506).
 The one with a generous heart earns the love of others and many associate
 with him (A.iii,40).
 Giving also cements friendships (Sn.
 187).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is maintained that if a person makes an aspiration to be born in a particular
 place after giving alms, the aspiration will be fulfilled only if he is
 virtuous, but not otherwise (A.iv,239).
 According to one sutta (A.iv,241-43), if one practices giving and morality
 to a very limited degree and has no idea about meditation, one obtains
 an unfortunate birth in the human world.
 One who performs meritorious deeds such as giving and morality to a considerabl
e degree, but does not understand anything about meditation, meets a fortunate
 human birth.
 But those who practice giving and morality to a great extent without any
 knowledge of meditation find rebirth in one of the heavens.
 They excel other deities in the length of life, beauty, pleasure, fame
 and the five strands of sense pleasure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv,79) enumerates a number of this-worldly benefits
 of giving.
 The generous person, and not the miser, wins the sympathy of others.
 arahants approach him, accept alms and preach to him first.
 A good reputation spreads about him.
 He can attend any assembly with confidence and dignity.
 He is reborn in a state of happiness after death.
 Another sutta (A.iii,41) adds that a generous person wins popularity; people
 of noble character associate with him and he has the satisfaction of having
 fulfilled a layperson's duties (gihidhamma anapeto hoti).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is said that an almsgiver bestows on others life, beauty, happiness,
 strength and intelligence.
 Having bestowed them on others, he becomes a beneficiary of them himself
 (A.iii,42).
 The same idea is expressed by the succinct statement that one reaps what
 one sows (yadisam vapate bijam tadisam harate phalam, S.i,227).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giving with faith results in the attainment of riches and beauty whenever
 the fruition of the gift occurs.
 By giving alms with due deference one gains, in addition, children, wives,
 subordinates and servants who are obedient, dutiful and understanding.
 By giving alms at the proper time not only does one obtain great wealth
 but also timely fulfillment of needs.
 By giving alms with the genuine desire to help others, one gains great
 wealth and the inclination to enjoy the best of sense pleasures.
 By giving alms without hurting oneself and others, one gains security from
 dangers such as fire, floods, thieves, kings and unloved heirs (A.
 iii,172).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alms given to recluses and brahmans who follow the Noble Eightfold Path
 yield wonderful results just as seeds sown on fertile, well-prepared, well-wate
red fields produce abundant crops (A.iv,238).
 Alms given without any expectations whatsoever can lead to birth in the
 Brahma-world, at the end of which one may become a non-returner (A.iv,62).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta enumerates a list of persons to whom alms can
 be offered and the merit accruing therefrom in ascending order.
 A thing given to an animal brings a reward a hundredfold.
 A gift given to an ordinary person of poor moral habit yields a reward
 a thousandfold; a gift given to a virtuous person yields a reward a hundred
 thousandfold.
 When a gift is given to a person outside the dispensation of Buddhism who
 is without attachment to sense pleasures, the yield is a hundred thousandfold
 of crores.
 When a gift is given to one on the path to stream-entry the yield is incalculab
le and immeasurable.
 So what can be said of a gift given to a stream-enterer, a once-returner,
 a non-returner, an arahant, a Paccekabuddha, and a Fully Enlightened Buddha?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same sutta emphasizes that a gift given to the Sangha as a group is
 more valuable than a gift offered to a single monk in his individual capacity.
 It is said that in the distant future there will be Buddhist monks who
 wear only a yellow collar as a distinguishing clerical mark, who are immoral
 and of evil character.
 If a gift is offered even to such monks in the name of the Order, it yields
 much more merit than a gift given to a monk in his individual capacity.
 But it should be observed that this statement is contradictory to ideas
 expressed elsewhere, that what is given to the virtuous is greatly beneficial
 but not what is given to the immoral.
 It is evident here that a later interpolation cannot be altogether ruled
 out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha once explained that it is a meritorious act even to throw away
 the water after washing one's plate with the generous thought: "May the
 particles of food in the washing water be food to the creatures on the
 ground." When that is so, how much more meritorious it is to feed a human
 being! But the sutta hastens to add that it is more meritorious to feed
 a virtuous person (A.i,161).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another sutta (A.iii,336) maintains that it is not possible to estimate the
 amount of merit that accrues when an offering is endowed with six particular
 characteristics.
 Three of the characteristics belong to the donor while three belong to
 the donee.
 The donor should be happy at the thought of giving prior to making the
 offering.
 He should be pleased at the time of making the offering, and he should
 be satisfied after the offering is made.
 Thus the nobility of thought — without a trace of greed before, during
 and after the offering — makes a gift truly great.
 The recipients also should be free from lust, hatred and delusion, or they
 should have embarked on a course of training for the elimination of these
 mental depravities.
 When an almsgiving is endowed with these qualities of the donor and donee,
 the merit is said to be as immeasurable as the waters in the ocean.

Once Visakha gave a learned explanation of the benefits she expected from
 her munificence when the Buddha questioned her as to what she saw as the
 advantages of her great generosity (Vin.i,293-94).
 She said that when she hears that a particular monk or nun has attained
 any of the fruits of recluseship, and if that monk or nun has visited Savatthi,
 she would be certain that he or she has partaken of the offerings she constantl
y makes.
 When she reflects that she has contributed in some measure to his or her
 spiritual distinction, great delight (pamujja) arises in her.
 Joy (piti) arises in the mind that is delighted.
 When the mind is joyful the body relaxes (kayo passambhissati).
 When the body relaxes a sense of ease (sukha) is experienced which helps
 the mind to be concentrated (cittam samadhiyissati).
 That will help the development of the spiritual faculties (indriyabhavana),
 spiritual powers (balahbavana), and factors of enlightenment (bojjhangabhavana).
 These are the advantages she hopes for by her munificence.
 The Buddha was so pleased with her erudite reply that he exclaimed, "Sadhu
 sadhu sadhu" in approbation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is evident that giving alone is not sufficient for one to make an end
 of suffering.
 Anathapindika, who was pronounced by the Buddha as the foremost among almsgiver
s, became only a stream-enterer.
 It is specifically said that dana has to be fortified by sila, morality,
 if it is to produce good results.
 Though Anathapindika practiced unblemished virtue, it is nowhere stated
 that he practiced mental culture or meditation (bhavana).
 Therefore, in spite of all his magnanimous munificence, he had to remain
 a stream-enterer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ghatikara Sutta (M.ii,52) records a unique almsgiving where even the
 donor was not present.
 Chatikara the potter was the chief benefactor of the Buddha Kassapa.
 He was a non-returner who did not want to enter the Order as he was looking
 after his blind, aged parents.
 He had greatly won the trust of the Buddha by the nobility of his conduct
 and devotion.
 One day the Buddha Kassapa went to his house on his alms round but Ghatikara
 was out.
 He asked the blind parents where the potter had gone.
 They replied that he had gone out, but invited the Buddha to serve himself
 from the pots and pans and partake of a meal.
 The Buddha did so.
 When Ghatikara returned and inquired who had taken from the food, the parents
 informed him that the Buddha had come and they had requested him to help
 himself to a meal.
 Ghatikara was overjoyed to hear this as he felt that the Buddha had so
 much trust in him.
 It is said that the joy and happiness (pitisukha) he experienced did not
 leave him for two weeks, and the parents' joy and happiness did not wane
 for a whole week.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same sutta reports that on another occasion the roof of the Buddha Kassapa's
 monastery started leaking.
 He sent the monks to Ghatikara's house to fetch some straw, but Ghatikara
 was out at the time.
 Monks came back and said that there was no straw available there except
 what was on the roof.
 The Buddha asked the monks to get the straw from the roof there.
 Monks started stripping the straw from the roof and the aged parents of
 Ghatikara asked who was removing the straw.
 The monks explained the matter and the parents said, "Please do take all
 the straw." When Ghatikara heard about this he was deeply moved by the trust
 the Buddha reposed in him.
 The joy and happiness that arose in him did not leave him for a full fortnight
 and that of his parents did not subside for a week.
 For three months Ghatikara's house remained without a roof with only the
 sky above, but it is said that the rain did not wet the house.
 Such was the great piety and generosity of Ghatikara.

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned at the beginning of this essay, dana is the first of the meritoriou
s deeds.
 It is also one of the four benevolent ways of treating others (cattari
 sangahavatthuni), A.iv,219).
 But is noteworthy that in the lists of virtues required for liberation
 such as those included among the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment
 (bodhipakkhiya dhamma),dana never occurs as a required virtue.
 Instead of dana,caga or generosity is included in some of the lists, such
 as the five qualities — faith virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom.
 Perhaps there is a slight difference between dana and caga when considered
 as virtues ingrained in the mind.
 Dana is the very practical act of giving, caga is the generous attitude
 ingrained in the mind by the repeated practice of dana.
 The word caga literally means giving up, abandonment, and it is an indication
 that the close-fitted selfish grip one has on one's possessions is loosened
 by caga.
 It is possible to give alms even out of negative motives such as favoritism
 (chanda), ill will (dosa), fear (bhaya), delusion (moha), desire for a
 good reputation, etc., but caga is the positive virtue of a generous disposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddhism teaches a gradual process of emptying oneself.
 It starts with giving away one's external possessions.
 When the generous dispositional trait sets in and is fortified by the deepening
 insight into the real nature of things, one grows disenchanted with sense
 pleasures (nibbindati).
 At this stage one gives up household life and seeks ordination.
 Next comes the emptying of sensory inputs by guarding the sense doors.
 Through meditation (bhavana) one empties oneself of deep-seated defilements
 and fills oneself with positive noble qualities.
 But this whole process of bailing out negativities starts with dana, the
 practice of giving.

Giving from the Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by M.
 O'C.
 Walshe
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giving comes very naturally to some people — they enjoy giving and are unhappy
 if they cannot do so.
 And though it is obvious that one can give foolishly, it is in general
 a very good and meritorious thing to give.
 This is recognized in, probably, all religions: in Christianity we are
 told that it is more blessed to give than to receive, and in Islam there
 is a positive injunction to give part of one's wealth to the poor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, however, we ought to start by squarely facing a point which may
 worry some people: the question of giving to the Sangha.
 In a phrase which lay Buddhists may frequently hear chanted, or even chant
 themselves, the Sangha is described as anuttaram punnakkhettam lokassa,
 "an unequalled field of merit-making for the world," meaning that the merit
 to be gained by giving to the Sangha is unequalled.
 Well of course, not all the lay people who hear or join in such chanting
 know what the words mean, but of those who do, Westerners who are Buddhists
 or Buddhist sympathizers sometimes react to this notion with a degree of
 indignation, considering the words tactless or worse! In fact some, whose
 conditioning was at least partly under the influence of the Lutheran Christian
 tradition, are reminded of the abuses to which Martin Luther objected in
 the Church of his day, when "good deeds" were very largely associated in
 the popular mind with maintaining priests and monks, who in some cases
 at least were idle and corrupt, in the style to which they were accustomed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such misgivings are perhaps understandable, but can be countered by a proper
 explanation, and will in any case not take root provided the Sangha is
 patently seen to be well conducted (supatipanno).
 The traditional Buddhist community consists of four groups: monks, nuns,
 male and female lay followers.
 Though the original order of nuns has died out, there are women who have
 undertaken the holy life and live virtually as nuns, and there is every
 indication that their numbers will grow.
 The relation between the first two groups and the latter two is one of
 symbiosis.
 After all, the Sangha has a priceless gift to give, the gift of the Dhamma.
 Sabbadanam dhammadanam jinati: "The gift of the Dhamma excels all other
 gifts" (Dhp.
 354).
 Members of the Sangha also have an inescapable obligation to live according
 to the Vinaya and to strive continuously for enlightenment.
 It is in fact only by so doing that they can claim to be "an unequalled
 field of merit-making," and if they fail in this obligation they are letting
 down not only themselves but also the laity who support them.
 A monk or nun who cannot observe the rules should, and in certain cases
 must, leave the Order.
 This could be regarded, at least in part, as the price to be paid for abusing
 the generosity of lay supporters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was mentioned above that, according to the Bible, it is more blessed
 to give than to receive.
 It is interesting to note that, just as in the practice of metta-bhavana,
 the meditation on universal love, there is given an actual method for fulfillin
g that difficult Judaeo-Christian injunction "love thy neighbor as thyself,"
 so too Buddhism can give a precise technical meaning to this biblical statement.
 If we receive something pleasant, this in Buddhism is considered to be
 vipaka, the result of previous meritorious conduct.
 It is nice while it lasts, but when it is finished, its virtue is exhausted.
 To give, however is kusala kamma, skilled action, which will be productive
 of some pleasant vipaka or result for the giver.
 In this way it can be clearly seen to be more "blessed" to give than to
 receive.
 True, this "blessing" remains purely mundane and limited, being "merit-making
 for the world" (lokassa).
 But as all our actions are habit-forming, giving once inclines us to give
 again, so that the result tends to be cumulative.
 Also, of course, this king of kusala kamma can lead on to other things,
 and it is not for nothing that dana is listed as the first among the ten
 paramis or "perfections," coming even before sila or morality.
 It is, after all, possible for an immoral person to be generous!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The late Dr.
 I.B.Horner selected ten Jataka stories to illustrate the ten perfections,
 in a little book that is widely used as an introductory Pali reader, and
 she used the delightful story of the self-sacrificing hare (No.
 316) to illustrate the perfection of giving.
 Strangely enough, though, to the Western mind at least, the most popular
 Jataka story on this theme is the very last, the Vessantara Jataka (No.
 547), in which the Bodhisatta gives everything away including, finally,
 his wife and children — a distinctly dubious moral, one might think! But
 in Thailand this story has been singled out and is regularly made the subject
 of special readings and sermons for the edification of the laity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giving is something that comes from the heart, and as I have said, there
 are people who enjoy giving for its own sake — which is fine provided the
 giving is balanced with wisdom.
 There are of course other people who are reluctant givers, and they are
 often the same people who find it difficult to say "please," "thank you,"
 "I'm sorry," and so on.
 For all such types the brahmavihara meditations on love and compassion
 would be beneficial, to enable them to open up their hearts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, in Britain, we have had a magnificent example of the power of
 giving from the heart, and from what to many must have seemed an unexpected
 source.
 Moved by the plight of the starving people in Ethiopia, the rock star Bob
 Geldof organized the fantastic international Live Aid concert which raised
 millions of pounds — in its way, and with the aid of modern technology,
 the most spectacular act of generosity in history, touching the hearts
 of millions, and transcending the boundaries not only of politics and religions
, but also that gulf that exists between those addicted to this particular
 form of entertainment and those who dislike it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that dana has to be exercised
 with discretion, and is as much subject to the rule of the middle way as
 everything else.
 It is not the best way to bring up a child, for instance, to give it everything
 it wants — or thinks it wants.
 Contrary to some trendy theories recently current, it does no harm to frustrate
 a spoilt brat occasionally! Nor, of course, is it the highest kind if giving
 if one expects something in return — even a nice rebirth in some heavenly
 realm! That is a kind of giving which is basically rooted in attachment
 and is therefore of limited kammic value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In point of fact, one of the true benefits to the giver is precisely that
 the act of spontaneous giving is a very fine way of helping to overcome
 attachment.
 And that is the intended point of the Vessantara story.
 We Westerners think of the unfortunate wife and family the Bodhisatta "sacrific
ed" (though of course there was happy ending and they came back to him,
 in the story!), but the intention is to regard them as objects of attachment,
 to be given up as such.
 As a matter of fact, despite the popularity of this particular story, modern
 scholars consider that it was not originally a Buddhist tale at all, and
 was somewhat unskillfully adapted to provide a "Buddhist" moral.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more we consider the question of dana, the more aspects emerge, and
 we see that there are many ways of giving, skillfully or otherwise.
 We may conclude with an amusing canonical example of the alleged results
 of relatively unskillful giving.
 In the Payasi Sutta (No.
 23 of the Digha Nikaya) we read of the debate between the skeptic Prince
 Payasi, who did not believe in an afterlife, and the Venerable Kumara-Kassapa.
 After listening to a brilliant series of parables from the monk, Payasi
 declares himself converted, and decides to establish a charity "for ascetics
 and brahmans, wayfarers, beggars and the needy," and he appoints the young
 brahman Uttara to organize the distribution.
 (N.B.
 This is the correct version — there is an error in the Rhys Davids translation
 at his point.) Uttara complains that the food and clothing he is called
 upon to distribute are of such poor quality that Payasi would not touch
 them himself, and Payasi finally gives him leave to supply "food as I eat
 and clothes as I wear." At the conclusion of the sutta, we are told of the
 rewards the two men received after death.
 Payasi, who had established the charity grudgingly, was indeed reborn in
 a heavenly world, but in the very lowest, that of the Four Great Kings,
 where he was lodged in the empty Serisaka mansion (vimana).
 Here, indeed, he was visited by the Venerable Gavampati, an arahant who
 made a habit of taking his siesta in the lower heavens.
 And so the story was brought back to earth.
 But Uttara, who had reorganized the charity and given from the heart, was
 born in a higher heaven, among the Thirty-three Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probably few Westerners will give in order to be reborn among the Thirty-three
 Gods, and perhaps the only reward some people look to is an easing of the
 conscience: being aware of some particular need — of which the case of
 Ethiopia is the outstanding current example — people feel unable to live
 with themselves if they do not give something.
 This is certainly better than hoping for a heavenly reward, but an easy
 conscience, too, may perhaps sometimes be purchased a little too easily.
 Best let the giving itself be its own reward, and leave it at that!

The giving away of useful or pleasant things is an act of generosity.
 However, if we only pay attention to the outward deeds we do not know whether
 or not we are being sincerely generous.
 We should learn more about the mind which motivates our deeds.
 True generosity is difficult.
 While we are giving, our thoughts may not all be good and noble.
 Our motives for giving may not all be pure.
 We may give with selfish motives — expecting something in return, hoping
 to be liked by the receiver or our gift, wanting to be known as a generous
 person.
 We may notice that there are different thoughts at different moments, some
 truly generous, and others having different motives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught that there is no lasting mind or soul which undergoes
 different experiences.
 Our experiences themselves are different moments of consciousness, which
 arise one at a time and then fall away immediately.
 Each moment of consciousness that arises and falls away is succeeded by
 the next moment of consciousness.
 Our life is thus a series of moments of consciousness arising in succession.
 Gradually we can learn to distinguish different types of consciousness.
 There is consciousness which is unwholesome or unskillful, and there is
 consciousness which is wholesome or skillful, and besides these there are
 other types of consciousness which are neither wholesome nor unwholesome.
 Only one type of consciousness occurs at a time, but each type is accompanied
 by several mental factors.
 Unwholesome types of consciousness are accompanied by unwholesome mental
 factors, such as attachment, stinginess, jealousy or aversion.
 Wholesome types of consciousness are accompanied by beautiful mental factors,
 such as generosity, kindness or compassion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three of the unwholesome mental factors are "roots of evil."6 These are the
 strong foundation of unwholesome types of consciousness: attachment or
 greed, aversion or anger, and ignorance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these unwholesome factors has many shades and degrees.
 We may know that there is attachment when we are greedy for food or desire
 to acquire someone else's property.
 However, we may not realize that there is also attachment when we enjoy
 natural scenery or beautiful music.
 In society attachment of a subtle kind is considered good, provided we
 do not harm others.
 The unwholesome has a wider range than what we call in conventional language
 "immoral." It can include states that are weaker than the immoral.
 We cannot force ourselves not to like beautiful things; there are conditions
 for the arising of attachment.
 But we can learn to know the difference between the moments which are wholesome
 and the moments which are unwholesome.
 A degree of selfishness persists even in moments of subtle attachment.
 These are different from selfless moments of consciousness accompanied
 by generosity, when we do not think of our own enjoyment.
 There is attachment time and again, when we stand up, move around, reach
 for things, eat or go to sleep.
 We think of ourselves and want to acquire pleasant things for ourselves.
 We expect other people to be nice to us, and this is also a form of attachment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may wonder whether attachment to relatives is wholesome.
 Attachment to relatives is not wholesome; it is different from pure loving-kind
ness, which is wholesome.
 When we cling to the pleasant feeling we derive from the company of relatives
 or dear friends, there is attachment.
 When we are genuinely concerned for someone else we do not think of ourselves,
 and then there is wholesome consciousness.
 We are so used to living with attachment that we may have never considered
 the difference between the moments of attachment and the moments of unselfish
 love.
 The different types of consciousness succeed one another so rapidly that
 so long as we have not developed understanding of them, we do not notice
 that they have changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unwholesome root of aversion also has many degrees.
 It can manifest as slight uneasiness or as coarse anger or hate.
 Aversion does not arise at the time as attachment.
 When there is attachment consciousness likes the object that is experienced
 and when there is aversion consciousness dislikes the object.
 Attachment arises with certain types of consciousness, not with all types,
 and so does aversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ignorance is an unwholesome root that arises with all types of unwholesome
 consciousness.
 It is the root of all evil.
 Ignorance does not know what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, it does
 not know anything about what is real.
 Whenever there is attachment or aversion, at the same time there is also
 ignorance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three beautiful roots are: non-attachment or generosity, non-aversion
 or kindness, and understanding or wisdom.
 Each type of wholesome consciousness is rooted in non-attachment and non-aversi
on, and it may be rooted in understanding as well.
 Each of these beautiful roots has many degrees.
 Without the assistance of non-attachment and non-aversion wholesome consciousne
ss could not arise motivating acts of generosity.
 Attachment cannot exist at the same time as generosity.
 When one is truly generous one gives impartially and does not restrict
 one's generosity to people one likes or to the members of one's family.
 The purpose of all kinds of wholesomeness should be to eliminate defilements,
 to get rid of selfishness.
 The Buddha taught the wisdom that can eradicate the clinging to the idea
 of self, but if one does not learn to get rid of stinginess and clings
 to one's possessions, one cannot give up the clinging to self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we see that true generosity is beneficial and that selfishness and
 stinginess are harmful, we would like to have more moments of generosity.
 However, in spite of our wishes, we notice that unwholesome types of consciousn
ess often arise.
 Then we are disappointed with ourselves.
 We should acquire understanding of what conditions the arising of unwholesome
 consciousness.
 We must have been full of attachment, aversion and ignorance in the past,
 even in past lives.
 Such tendencies have become deeply rooted; they have been accumulated.
 What is past has gone already, but the unwholesome tendencies that have
 been accumulated can condition the arising of unwholesome consciousness
 at the present time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have accumulated not only tendencies to evil but also inclinations to
 the wholesome.
 That is why there can also be moments of generosity and kindness at the
 present time.
 When an unwholesome type of consciousness arises we accumulate more unwholesome
ness; when a wholesome type arises we accumulate more wholesomeness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught different ways of developing wholesomeness, and when we
 learn about these ways there are already conditions for more wholesomeness.
 We find opportunity for generosity not only while we are giving but also
 before the actual giving, when we try to obtain the things we intend to
 give, and afterwards when we recollect our giving.
 When we are honest with ourselves we can notice that before, during and
 after the giving, opportunities for generosity are often spoilt by unwholesome
 consciousness.
 We may get tired when we have to buy or prepare the gift, and then aversion
 arises.
 While we are giving the gift the receiver may be ungrateful and fail to
 respond to our gift in the way we expected and then we may be disappointed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when we have right understanding of what wholesomeness is, we should
 be concerned only with developing wholesome states of mind and not with
 the reactions of other people.
 Wholesomeness is wholesomeness and nobody else can change the wholesome
 consciousness that arises.
 Before we learned about the Buddha's teachings we did not consider generosity
 in this way, we did not pay attention to the moments of consciousness.
 Through the Buddha's teachings we learn about things as they really are.
 After the act of giving the opportunity to recollect our generosity with
 wholesome consciousness can be wasted by unwholesome consciousness.
 At first we may have been generous, but afterwards we may find that the
 gift was too expensive and regret have spent our money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught that there is no self that can exert power over the different
 types of consciousness that arise; they arise because of their appropriate
 conditions.
 Through his teachings we can learn about the different types of consciousness
 and about our accumulated tendencies.
 Thus there will be more understanding of what is real, and this too is
 wholesome.
 When one has accumulated the tendency to stinginess it is difficult to
 be generous, but through the understanding of what the Buddha taught inclinatio
ns can be changed.

\begin_layout Standard
We read in the commentary to the Subhabhojana Jataka (Stories of the Buddha's
 Former Births, Jatakas, Book V, No.
 535) about a monk in the Buddha's time who practiced the utmost generosity.
 He gave away his food, and if he received drink sufficient to fill the
 hollow of his hand, he would, free from greed, still give it away.
 But formerly he used to be so stingy that "he would not give so much as
 a drop of oil on the tip of a blade of grass." In one of his past lives,
 when he was named Kosiya, he lived as a miser.
 One day he had a craving for rice porridge.
 When his wife suggested that she would cook porridge not only for him but
 also for all the inhabitants of Benares, he felt "just as if he had been
 struck on the head with a stick." Then his wife offered to cook for a single
 street, or only for the attendants in his house, only for the family, only
 for the two of them, but he turned down all her offers.
 He wanted porridge cooked for himself alone, in the forest, so that nobody
 else could see it.
 The Bodhisatta, who was at that time the god Sakka, wanted to convert him
 and came to him with four attendants disguised as brahmans.
 One by one they approached the miser and begged for some of his porridge.
 Sakka spoke the following stanza, praising generosity (387):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From little one should little give, from moderate means likewise, From much
 give much: of giving nothing no question can arise.
 This then I tell you, Kosiya, give alms of that is thine: Eat not alone,
 no bliss is his that by himself shall dine, By charity you may ascend the
 noble path divine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kosiya reluctantly offered them some porridge.
 Then one of the brahmans changed into a dog.
 The dog made water and a drop of it fell on Kosiya's hand.
 Kosiya went to the river to wash and then the dog made water in Kosiya's
 cooking pot.
 When Kosiya threatened him he changed into a "blood horse" and pursued
 Kosiya.
 Then Sakka and his attendants stood in the air and Sakka preached to Kosiya
 out of compassion and warned him of an unhappy rebirth.
 Kosiya came to understand the danger of stinginess.
 He gave away all his possessions and became an ascetic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may find it difficult to part with our possessions, but when we die we
 cannot take them with us.
 Life is short: thus when we have an opportunity for generosity we should
 use it in order to combat selfishness.
 Each moment of generosity now will condition the arising of generosity
 in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good deeds bring about pleasant results and bad deeds bring unpleasant results.
 This is the law of kamma and its fruit, of cause and effect.7 A deed (kamma)
 can produce result in the form of rebirth.
 Wholesome kamma can produce a happy rebirth and unwholesome kamma can produce
 an unhappy rebirth.
 Besides the human plane of existence, there are other planes which are
 happy or unhappy.
 Birth in the human plane or in a heavenly plane is a happy rebirth conditioned
 by wholesome kamma; birth in a hell plane, as a ghost or as an animal is
 an unhappy rebirth conditioned by unwholesome kamma.
 Kamma can also produce results in the form of pleasant or unpleasant sense
 experiences arising in the course of life.
 Seeing and hearing are types of consciousness that are results of kamma.
 We see and hear pleasant or unpleasant objects according to the kamma that
 produces these experiences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stinginess can bring about — either in this life or in a future life — the
 very result we fear: loss of possessions.
 Generosity can bring about pleasant results, such as prosperity.
 However, when we perform acts of generosity we should not cling to pleasant
 results; clinging is unwholesome.
 Kamma will produce its appropriate result whether we think of it or not.
 While we are giving we can have right understanding of kamma and its result,
 without clinging.
 We may do good deeds with the understanding of what wholesomeness is.
 As we have seen, understanding is a beautiful root which may or may not
 accompany wholesome consciousness.
 When understanding accompanies the wholesome consciousness, it increases
 the degree of wholesomeness.
 We cannot make understanding arise at will; it arises when there are conditions
 for it.
 Learning what the Buddha taught is a condition for greater understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are still other ways of practicing generosity, even when we do not
 have things to give.
 The application of other people's good deeds is also a type of generosity.
 When we notice that someone else is doing a good deed we can appreciate
 his wholesomeness, and we may express this with words of approval and praise.
 We may be stingy not only with regard to our possessions but also with
 regard to words of praise.
 Gradually one can learn to be generous in appreciating the wholesomeness
 of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Thailand I had an opportunity to learn about this way of generosity,
 which I had not heard of before.
 I received a book that was printed on the occasion of the birthday of Her
 Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand.
 This book mentioned many of her good works, such as promoting the teaching
 of Buddhism, supporting temples, improving the standard of living of the
 people in the provinces by setting up different projects for them.
 When one reads this one can sincerely admire and rejoice in the good works
 of Her Majesty.
 In Thailand I also often heard the Thais saying, "anumodana," which means
 "thanks," with the inclination of their head and clasped hands.
 This they do when they respect and appreciate the wholesomeness of others,
 usually on occasions of presenting food to the monks or giving books on
 the Buddhist teachings.
 It can become a wholesome custom to express one's appreciation on such
 occasions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we know about this way of generosity we may remember to speak about
 others with wholesome consciousness.
 In the development of wholesomeness one has to be farsighted.
 One should realize that whatever wholesomeness or unwholesomeness one accumulat
es today will produce its effects in the future, even in future lives.
 One can become more adept in evaluating the circumstances one is in and
 the friends one has.
 One will then be able to judge whether or not one's surroundings and friends
 are favorable for the development of wholesomeness.
 One will know what kind of speech should be avoided, what kind of speech
 cultivated.
 Often conversation tends to be about the bad qualities of others or about
 useless matters which are not helpful for the development of wholesomeness.
 Since we often become engaged in conversation with others, we should learn
 how to turn the conversation into an opportunity for wholesomeness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way of generosity is the "sharing" of one's wholesome deeds with
 others.
 This does not mean that other people can receive the pleasant results of
 our good deeds.
 The Buddha taught that beings are "heirs" to their deeds.
 We each receive the results of the deeds we have done ourselves.
 Sharing wholesomeness with others means that our good deeds can be the
 condition for the arising of wholesome consciousness in others when they
 rejoice in our good deeds.
 We can share wholesomeness even with beings in other planes of existence,
 provided they are in planes where they can receive the benefits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commentary to the Without the Walls Sutta8 narrates that King Bimbisara
 offered a meal to the Buddha and omitted to dedicate his merits to other
 beings.
 Ghosts, his relatives in a former life, had hoped for this in vain, and
 because they were disappointed, in their despair they made a horrible screechin
g noise throughout the night.
 The Buddha explained to King Bimbisara why the ghosts had screeched.
 Then King Bimbisara made another offering and uttered the dedication, "Let
 this be for those relatives." The ghosts benefited from his gifts immediately;
 they had wholesome states of consciousness and their sufferings were allayed.
 Lotus-covered pools were generated for them in which they could bathe and
 drink, and they took on the color of gold.
 Heavenly food, heavenly clothing and heavenly palaces manifested spontaneously
 for their use.
 This story illustrates that one can share one's good deeds with departed
 ones.
 If one's departed relatives are not able to receive the merit, other beings
 can.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is understandable that we are sad when we lose loved ones, but if we
 know how to develop what is wholesome we can find great consolation.
 Instead of becoming filled with sadness and aversion, we should dedicate
 our good deeds to all those who are able to rejoice in them, then our conscious
ness will be wholesome.
 It can become our custom to share wholesomeness with others; we need not
 even specify to whom we wish to dedicate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a Buddhist custom when a meal or robes are offered to monks to pour
 water over one's hands while the monks recite words of blessings, in order
 to give expression to one's intention to dedicate this deed to other beings.
 The water symbolizes a river which fills the ocean, and even so a wholesome
 deed is so plentiful that it can also be shared with others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good deeds are usually classified as threefold: as generosity, morality,
 and mental development.
 This threefold classification should not be considered a rigid one.
 Morality, or abstinence from evil deeds, can also be seen as an aspect
 of generosity, as an act of kindness to others.
 When we abstain from evil deeds we give other beings the opportunity to
 live in peace, free from harm.
 If we want to develop generosity, we should not neglect mental development
 — the development of wholesome states of mind.
 We should know when consciousness is unwholesome and when wholesome in
 order to develop generosity and other good qualities.
 Knowing more about one's different types of consciousness is mental development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "stream-winner" is the noble person at the first stage of enlightenment.
 He has developed right understanding of the different mental and physical
 phenomena that appear at the present moment and has seen realities as they
 are.
 With the attainment of enlightenment he experiences Nibbana, the unconditioned
 reality, for the first time.
 At the moment of enlightenment the wrong view of self is eradicated, and
 with it stinginess too is destroyed.
 Stinginess can never arise again, and he thus has perfect generosity.
 An ordinary person may be able to suppress stinginess temporarily, for
 example, at the time of giving, but stinginess is bound to arise again
 so long as its accumulated tendency remains.
 The stream-winner, through right understanding, has eradicated the tendency
 to stinginess and can never be overcome by it anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Learning from the Buddha's teachings how to develop wholesomeness and to
 eradicate defilements is the greatest blessing.
 Therefore the teaching of the Dhamma, the Buddha's teaching, should be
 considered as the giving of the highest gift.
 In learning what the Buddha taught and in developing wholesomeness we correct
 our views about what is worthwhile striving for and what is not, about
 what is real and what is mere illusion.
 Before we heard about the Buddha's teachings we may have considered the
 enjoyment of pleasant sense objects to be the goal of our life.
 After we learn the Buddha's teachings we may gradually come to see that
 selfish attachment gives unrest of mind and that it is harmful to ourselves
 and others.
 We may come to understand that wholesomeness is beneficial both for ourselves
 and for others, that it brings peace of mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our outlook on what is worthwhile in life can change.
 We correct our views about reality when we understand what wholesome kamma
 is and what unwholesome kamma is, when we understand that kamma brings
 its appropriate result.
 We correct our views when we understand that not a self but different types
 of consciousness, wholesome and unwholesome, motivate our deeds, when we
 understand that these types of consciousness arise because of different
 conditioning factors.
 There are many degrees of correcting one's views.
 By developing understanding of realities the wrong view of self can be
 eradicated, and thereby perfect generosity can emerge.
 The effect of learning the Dhamma should be that we become less selfish
 and more generous, that we have more genuine concern for other people.

The Perfection of Giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Acariya Dhammapala
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the Cariyapitaka Atthakatha, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in The Discourse
 on the All-Embracing Net of Views: The Brahmajala Sutta and Its Commentaries
 (BPS, 1978), pp.
 289-96, pp.
 322-23.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The perfection of giving is to be practiced by benefiting beings in many
 ways — by relinquishing one's happiness, belongings, body and life to others,
 by dispelling their fear, and by instructing them in the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein, giving is threefold by way of the object to be given: the giving
 of material things (amisadana), the giving of fearlessness (abhayadana),
 and the giving of the Dhamma (dhammadana).
 Among these, the object to be given can be twofold: internal and external.
 The external gift is tenfold: food, drink, garments, vehicles, garlands,
 scents, unguents, bedding, dwellings, and lamps.
 These gifts, again, become manifold by analyzing each into its constituents,
 e.g., food into hard food, soft food, etc.
 The external gift can also become sixfold when analyzed by way of sense
 objects: visible forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and non-sensory
 objects.
 The sense objects, such as visible forms, become manifold when analyzed
 into blue, etc.
 So too, the external gift is manifold by way of the divers valuables and
 belongings, such as gems, gold, silver, pearls, coral, etc.; fields, land,
 parks, etc.; slaves, cows, buffaloes, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Great Man (the Bodhisatta) gives an external object, he gives whatever
 is needed to whomever stands in need of it; and knowing by himself that
 someone is in need of something, he gives it even unasked, much more when
 asked.
 He gives sufficiently, not insufficiently, when there is something to be
 given.
 He does not give because he expects something in return.
 And when there is not enough to give sufficiently to all, he distributes
 evenly whatever can be shared.
 But he does not give things that issue in affliction for others, such as
 weapons, poisons, and intoxicants.
 Nor does he give amusements which are harmful and lead to negligence.
 And he does not give unsuitable food or drink to a person who is sick,
 even though he might ask for it, and he does not give what is suitable
 beyond the proper measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, when asked, he gives to householders things appropriate for householders,
 and to monks things appropriate for monks.
 He gives to his mother and father, kinsmen and relatives, friends and colleague
s, children, wife, slaves, and workers, without causing pain to anyone.
 Having promised an excellent gift, he does not give something mean.
 He does not give because he desires gain, honor, or fame, or because he
 expects something in return, or out of expectation of some fruit other
 than the supreme enlightenment.
 He does not give detesting the gift or those who ask.
 He does not give a discarded object as a gift, not even to unrestrained
 beggars who revile and abuse him.
 Invariable he gives with care, with a serene mind, full of compassion.
 He does not give through belief in superstitious omens: but he gives believing
 in kamma and its fruit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he gives he does not afflict those who ask by making them do homage
 to him, etc.; but he gives without afflicting others.
 He does not give a gift with the intention of deceiving others or with
 the intention of injuring; he gives only with an undefiled mind.
 He does not give a gift with harsh words or a frown, but with words of
 endearment, congenial speech, and a smile on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever greed for a particular object becomes excessive, due to its high
 value and beauty, its antiquity, or personal attachment, the Bodhisatta
 recognizes his greed, quickly dispels it, seeks out some recipients, and
 gives it away.
 And if there should be an object of limited value that can be given and
 a suppliant expecting it, without a second thought he bestirs himself and
 gives it to him, honoring him as though he were an uncelebrated sage.
 Asked for his own children, wife, slaves, workers, and servants, the Great
 Man does not give them while they are as yet unwilling to go, afflicted
 with grief.
 But when they are willing and joyful, then he gives them.
 But if he knows that those who ask for them are demonic beings — ogres,
 demons, or goblins — or men of cruel disposition, then he does not give
 them away.
 So too, he will not give his kingdom to those intent on the harm, suffering,
 and affliction of the world, but he would give it away to righteous men
 who protect the world with Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, firstly, is the way to practice the giving of external gifts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The internal gift should be understood in two ways.
 How? Just as a man, for the sake of food and clothing, surrenders himself
 to another and enters into servitude and slavery, in the same way the Great
 Man, wishing for the supreme welfare and happiness of all beings, desiring
 to fulfill his own perfection of giving, with a spiritually-oriented mind,
 for the sake of enlightenment, surrenders himself to another and enters
 into servitude, placing himself at the disposal of others.
 Whatever limbs or organs of his might be needed by others — hands, feet,
 eyes, etc.
 — he gives them away to those who need them, without trembling and without
 cowering.
 He is no more attached to them, and no more shrinks away (from giving them
 to others), than if they were external objects.
 Thus the Great Man relinquishes an internal object in two ways: for the
 enjoyment of others according to their pleasure; or, while fulfilling the
 wishes of those who ask, for his own self-mastery.
 In this matter he is completely generous, and thinks: "I will attain enlightenm
ent through non-attachment." Thus the giving of the internal gift should
 be understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein, giving an internal gift, he gives only what leads to the welfare
 of the recipient, and nothing else.
 The Great Man does not knowingly give his own body, limbs, and organs to
 Mara or to the malevolent deities in Mara' s company, thinking: "Let this
 not lead to their harm." And likewise, he does not give to those possessed
 by Mara or his deities, or to madmen.
 But when asked for these things by others, he gives immediately, because
 of the rarity of such a request and the difficulty of making such a gift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The giving of fearlessness is the giving of protection to beings when they
 have become frightened on account of kings, thieves, fire, water, enemies,
 lions, tigers, other wild beasts, dragons, ogres, demons, goblins, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The giving of the Dhamma is an unperverted discourse on the Dhamma given
 with an undefiled mind; that is, methodical instruction conducive to good
 in the present life, to good in the life to come, and to ultimate deliverance.
 By means of such discourses, those who have not entered the Buddha's Dispensati
on enter it, while those who have entered it reach maturity therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the method: In brief, he gives a talk on giving, on virtue, and
 on heaven, on the unsatisfactoriness and defilement in sense pleasures,
 and on the benefit in renouncing them.
 In detail, to those whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment
 of disciples (savakabodhi) he gives a discourse establishing and purifying
 them (in progress towards their goal) by elaborating upon the noble qualities
 of whichever among the following topics is appropriate: going for refuge,
 restraint by virtue, guarding the doors of the sense-faculties, moderation
 in eating, application to wakefulness, the seven good dhammas; application
 to serenity (samatha) by practicing meditation on one of the thirty-eight
 objects (of serenity meditation); application to insight (vipassana) by
 contemplating the objects of insight-interpretation such as the material
 body; the progressive stages of purification (visuddhipatipada), the apprehensi
on of the course of rightness (sammattagahana), the three kinds of clear
 knowledge (vijja), the six kinds of direct knowledge (abhiñña), the four
 discriminations (patisambhida), and the enlightenment of a disciple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So too, for beings whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of
 paccekabuddhas and of perfectly enlightened Buddhas, he gives a discourse
 establishing and purifying them in the two vehicles (leading to these two
 types of enlightenment) by elaborating upon the greatness of the spiritual
 power of those Buddhas, and by explaining the specific nature, characteristic,
 function, etc., of the ten paramis in their three stages.
 Thus the Great Man gives the gift of the Dhamma to beings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he gives a material gift, the Great Man gives food thinking: "May I,
 by this gift, enable beings to achieve long life, beauty, happiness, strength,
 intelligence, and the supreme fruit of unsullied bliss." He gives drink
 wishing to allay the thirst of sensual defilements; garments to gain the
 adornments of shame and moral dread and the golden complexion (of a Buddha);
 vehicles for attaining the modes of psychic potency and the bliss of Nibbana;
 scents for producing the sweet scent of virtue; garlands and unguents for
 producing the beauty of the Buddha-qualities; seats for producing the seat
 on the terrace of enlightenment; bedding for producing the bed of a Tathagata's
 rest; dwellings so he might become a refuge for beings; lamps so he might
 obtain the five eyes.9 He gives visible forms for producing the fathom-wide
 aura (surrounding a Buddha); sounds for producing the Brahma-like voice
 (of a Buddha); tastes for endearing himself to all the world; and tangibles
 for acquiring a Buddha's elegance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He gives medicines so he might later give the ageless and deathless state
 of Nibbana.
 He gives slaves the gift of freedom so he might later emancipate beings
 from the slavery of the defilements.
 He gives blameless amusements and enjoyments in order to produce delight
 in the true Dhamma.
 He gives his own children as a gift in order that he might adopt all beings
 as his children by granting them an ariyan birth.
 He gives his wives as a gift in order that he might become master over
 the entire world.
 He gives gifts of gold, gems, pearls, coral, etc., in order to achieve the
 major marks of physical beauty (characteristic of a Buddha's body), and
 gifts of the diverse means of beautification in order to achieve the minor
 features of physical beauty.10 He gives his treasuries as a gift in order
 to obtain the treasury of the true Dhamma; the gift of his kingdom in order
 to become the king of the Dhamma; the gift of monasteries, parks, ponds,
 and groves in order to achieve the jhanas, etc.; the gift of his feet in
 order that he might be marked with the auspicious wheels; the gift of his
 hands in order that he might give to beings the rescuing hand of the true
 Dhamma to help them across the four floods;11 the gift of his ears, nose,
 etc., in order to obtain the spiritual faculties of faith, etc.; the gift
 of his eyes in order to obtain the universal eye; the gift of his flesh
 and blood with the thought: "May my body be the means of life for all the
 world! May it bring welfare and happiness to all beings at all times, even
 on occasions of merely seeing, hearing, recollecting, or ministering to
 me!" And he gives the gift of his head in order to become supreme in all
 the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giving thus, the Great Man does not give unwillingly, nor by afflicting
 others, nor out of fear, moral shame, or the scolding of those in need
 of gifts.
 When there is something excellent, he does not give what is mean.
 He does not give extolling himself and disparaging others.
 He does not give out of desire for the fruit, nor with loathing for those
 who ask, nor with lack of consideration.
 Rather, he gives thoroughly, with his own hand, at the proper time, considerate
ly, without discrimination, filled with joy throughout the three times.12
 Having given, he does not become remorseful afterwards.
 He does not become either conceited or obsequious in relation to the recipients
, but behaves amiably towards them.
 Bountiful and liberal, he gives things together with a bonus (saparivara).
 For when he gives food, thinking: "I will give this along with a bonus,"
 he gives garments, etc., as well.
 And when he gives garments, thinking: "I will give this along with a bonus,"
 he gives food, etc., as well.
 The same method with gifts of vehicles, etc.
 And when he gives a gift of one of the sense objects, such as visible forms,
 he gives the other sense objects also as a bonus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gift of visible forms should be understood thus.
 Having gained something, such as a flower, garment, or relic of a blue,
 yellow, red, or white color, etc., considering it in terms of its visible
 form, thinking to make a gift of a visible form, he offers it to a worthy
 recipient together with its base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gift of sounds should be understood by way of the sounds of drums, etc.
 It is certainly not possible to give a sound as one gives a cluster of
 lotuses, tearing it out by its bulb and roots and placing it in the hands.
 But one gives a gift of sound by giving its base.
 Thus he makes a gift of sound by presenting a musical instrument, such
 as drums or tom toms, to the Triple Gem; or by giving medicine for the
 voice, such as oil and molasses, to preachers of the Dhamma; or by announcing
 a lecture on the Dhamma, chanting the scriptures, giving a discourse on
 the Dhamma, holding a discussion, or expressing appreciation for the good
 deeds of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gift of scents is made when, after getting a delightfully scented object,
 such as scented roots, powdered scent, etc., considering it in terms of
 its scent, thinking to make a gift of scent, he offers it to the Triple
 Gem.
 He relinquishes a scented object such as agaru or sandalwood, for the purpose
 of making an offering of scent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gift of tastes is made when, after getting a delightfully flavored object,
 such as flavored roots, etc., considering it in terms of its taste, thinking
 to make a gift of taste, he gives it to worthy recipients.
 Or he relinquishes a flavorful object, such as grain, cows, etc.13
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gift of tangibles should be understood by way of beds, chairs, etc.,
 and by way of coverlets and mantels, etc.
 For having gained some soft, delightful, blameless tangible object, such
 as a bed, chair, cushion, pillow, undergarment, or uppergarment, considering
 it in terms of its tangible qualities, thinking to make a gift of a tangible
 item, he gives it to worthy recipients; having gained the aforesaid tangible
 objects, he relinquishes them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gift of mental objects (dhammadana) should be understood by way of nutriment
, drink, and life, since it is the mental-object base which is here intended.14
 Having gained a delightful object such as nutriment, considering it as
 part of the mental-object base, thinking to make a gift of a non-sensory
 object, he gives nutriment — i.e., ghee, butter, etc., or a drink — i.e., the
 eight kinds of drink such as mango juice, etc.; or, considering it a gift
 of life, he gives a ticket-meal or a fortnightly meal, etc., gets doctors
 to wait upon the sick and afflicted, liberates animals from a net, has
 a fishing net or bird-cage destroyed, releases prisoners from prison, causes
 an injunction to be given forbidding the slaughter of animals, or undertakes
 any action of a similar nature for the sake of protecting the life of beings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This entire accomplishment in giving he dedicates to the welfare and happiness
 of the whole world, and to his own unshakable emancipation through supreme
 enlightenment.
 He dedicates it to the attainment of inexhaustible desire (for the good),
 inexhaustible concentration, ingenuity, knowledge, and emancipation.
 In practicing the perfection of giving the Great Being should apply the
 perception of impermanence to life and possessions.
 He should consider them as shared in common with many, and should constantly
 and continuously arouse great compassion towards beings.
 Just as, when a house is blazing, the owner removes all his property of
 essential value and himself as well without leaving anything important
 behind, so does the Great Man invariably give, without discrimination and
 without concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Great Man has made a mental determination to completely relinquish
 whatever possessions come his way, whether animate or inanimate, there
 are four shackles to giving (which he must overcome), namely, not being
 accustomed to giving in the past, the inferiority of the object to be given,
 the excellence and beauty of the object, and worry over the loss of the
 object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) When the Bodhisatta possesses objects that can be given and suppliants
 are present, but his mind does not leap up at the thought of giving and
 he does not want to give, he should conclude: "Surely, I have not been
 accustomed to giving in the past, therefore a desire to give does not arise
 now in my mind.
 So that my mind will delight in giving in the future, I will give a gift.
 With an eye for the future let me now relinquish what I have to those in
 need." Thus he gives a gift — generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishing,
 one who gives when asked, delighting in giving and in sharing.
 In this way the Great Being destroys, shatters, and eradicates the first
 shackle to giving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Again, when the object to be given is inferior or defective, the Great
 Being reflects: "Because I was not inclined to giving in the past, at present
 my requisites are defective.
 Therefore, though it pains me, let me give whatever I have as a gift even
 if the object is low and inferior.
 In that way I will, in the future, reach the peak in the perfection of
 giving." Thus he gives whatever kind of gift he can — generous, openhanded,
 delighting in relinquishing, one who gives when asked, delighting in giving
 and in sharing.
 In this way the Great Being destroys, shatters, and eradicates the second
 shackle to giving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) When a reluctance to give arises due to the excellence or beauty of
 the object to be given, the Great Being admonishes himself: "Good man,
 haven't you made the aspiration for the supreme enlightenment, the loftiest
 and most superior of all states? Well then, for the sake of enlightenment,
 it is proper for you to give excellent and beautiful objects as gifts."
 Thus he gives what is excellent and beautiful — generous, open-handed,
 delighting in relinquishing, one who gives when asked, delighting in giving
 and in sharing.
 In this way the Great Man destroys, shatters, and eradicates the third
 shackle to giving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) When the Great Being is giving a gift, and he sees the loss of the object
 being given, he reflects thus: "This is the nature of material possessions,
 that they are subject to loss and to passing away.
 Moreover, it is because I did not give such gifts in the past that my possessio
ns are now depleted.
 Let me then give whatever I have as a gift, whether it be limited or abundant.
 In that way I will, in the future, reach the peak in the perfection of
 giving." Thus he gives whatever he has as a gift — generous, open-handed,
 delighting in relinquishing, one who gives when asked, delighting in giving
 and in sharing.
 In this way the Great Being destroys, shatters, and eradicates the fourth
 shackle to giving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reflecting upon them thus in whatever way is appropriate is the means for
 dispelling the harmful shackles to the perfection of giving.
 The same method used for the perfection of giving also applies to the perfectio
n of virtue and the other perfections.

What Can Be Done About Conceit?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Dr.
 Elizabeth Ashby
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(From "The Sangha," The Journal of the English Sangha Association, III.11)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Christian literature of the lighter sort we sometimes come across the
 expression "Little Devil DOUBT." This personage is not known to Buddhists,
 but another little devil can be still more devastating.
 He is an ugly little Mara, named CONCEIT.
 Unlike his big brother Pride, who is not lacking in dignity, Conceit is
 a mean, slinking little devil, lurking in dark corners and always ready
 to rush out and nip our heels.
 Doubt is slain when the disciple wins the stream: Conceit being a manifestation
 of Pride, remains a menace to the very end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pride in all its forms, devolves from self-esteem, which is in reality "ego-wors
hip." It stems, so they say, from Greed, the first of the Roots of evil.
 The thought here is rather subtle: when the ordinary person thinks of greed
 he thinks first of what one puts into one's tummy — that second helping
 of plum-pudding, or the consumption of a pound of candies in a single evening.
 The commentators of old were much more drastic.
 Greed is "delight in one's own possessions." Hence we can be greedy about
 anything to which we have affixed the label "mine." My car, my table, my
 cat, my best beloved.
 The Greedy aspect of Conceit is recognized when we realize we are "taking
 delight" in our own good qualities or capacities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conceit can arise from the most trivial cause.
 One completes a piece of work, and having made a good job of it, one is
 naturally pleased.
 There's no harm in that: we all know the difference between a worker whose
 only interest is his pay-packet, and the man who takes pride in his work.
 The trouble arises when we begin to make comparisons — "X.
 couldn't have done it half as well." That may be quite true, but it is dangerous
 to think that because one's skill is superior in a single instance that
 one is therefore a better person.
 That is "Superiority Conceit," and it has its counterpart in the "Inferiority
 Conceit" of the unsuccessful person, and the "Equality Conceit" of the
 man who says "I'm as good as you." With the underlying implication "And
 a good deal better!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A feeling of superiority is a very pleasant mental state, but it is essentially
 akusala — unhealthy and unskilled, highly dangerous in its results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any conceit that arises in connection with the practice of Dhamma is much
 to be deplored.
 This sometimes occurs when students are making good progress in their studies.
 Some queer experience or flash of "insight" is assumed to be a sign of
 virtue or an advance towards Higher Consciousness, and the student, instead
 of checking up on his experience with a wise teacher, jumps to the conclusion
 that he is half-way to being an Arahant.
 We do well to remember that no two people have exactly the same experience
 in regard to meditation practice.
 The was recognized in the Buddha's own day: Sariputta was revered for his
 wisdom, and Moggallana for his psychic powers, but both were venerated
 as "Great Beings."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conceit is very prone to arise when one is praised for some particular work
 or mental quality.
 Within limits praise from a knowledgeable person is stimulating and encouraging
; some people who are modest or diffident by nature can only work well when
 they are appreciated.
 The trouble is that too much praise, particularly if it borders on flattery,
 stimulates the sense of "I"-ness.
 The ego sticks out its chest and feels two inches taller; it has a delicious
 feeling of security and believes itself to be invulnerable!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the nasty sort of pride that the ancient Greeks called hubris; it
 was looked upon as an insult to the gods, and when the Olympians found
 a man suffering from it they unloosed Nemesis, the goddess of revenge,
 who brought him to death or destruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cultivation of humility is not easy; there's a temptation to indulge
 in mock-modesty, and untruthfully disclaim any real achievement, and still
 worse to be conceited about not being conceited.
 It is wiser, I think, to tackle Conceit at its first uprising; if one can
 do that, then Humility will develop in the natural course of events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our comfort we find that much can be done to curb the activities of
 this persistent Mara.
 Pride has been aptly described as the "giant weed." We may grub up a few
 roots in this life-span, but the thing has already gone to seed and will
 appear in the future.
\end_layout

say the old gardeners.
 If we acquire the habit of eradicating conceit in this life, the habit
 will travel on in our sankharas and bear good fruit in future lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Recognize Conceit whenever he pops up and name him.
 This as readers will remember is the advise given by Nyanaponika Thera
 in his valuable articles in "Sangha." Mara, like Satan, hates to be recognized.
 This practice is doubly effective because it "keeps one on one's toes,"
 and induces a real dislike of the tendency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Get back to the first two "steps" of the Noble Eightfold Path (a) Right
 Understanding of the mental quality or capacity involved: to see according
 to reality "This (quality) is not mine; I am not this; there is no self
 in it"; (b) Right Aspiration towards the expunging of Conceit.
 In the Discourse on Expunging (Majjh.
 Nik.
 I.8) we read "Now I say that the arising of thoughts is very helpful in
 regard to skilled states of mind.
 Therefore the thought should arise 'Others may be harmful; as to this we
 will not be harmful' and so on for all our evil propensities.
 Others may be conceited; but we as to this will not be conceited.'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of analysis is also helpful.
 "I" am being praised for some real or imagined virtue, say generosity.
 Generosity is non-greed (alobha) one of the Good Roots, and as such appears
 in the list of dharmas given in the Abhidharma philosophy.
 According to Mahayana "All dharmas are empty of own-being" — that is to
 say they are non-existent.
 Therefore "I" am being praised for something which doesn't exist.
 This is so absurd that it knocks the bottom out of my conceit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively "I" am the result of past kamma.
 My talents are not due to my own virtue, but have arisen on account of
 the skilled actions performed by vanished personalities whose kammic descendant
 "I" am.
 Therefore it is silly of me to be conceited about qualities which are not
 in any real sense "mine."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again and again in the suttas we find the expression "Thus must you train..."
 This is Buddhist mental culture: it is Right or Supreme Effort to put down
 unskilled mental states and prevent them rising in the future, and furthermore
 to encourage the arising of skilled states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A word of warning may not be out of place here.
 It is inadvisable to dwell too much on our so-obvious faults.
 By unwisely reflecting on them we encourage them to root themselves still
 more firmly in our unconscious (i.e., our sankharas).
 Instead remember the advice of Paul the Apostle "Whatsoever things are
 true, whatsoever things are honest...
 whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if
 there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things." We
 as Buddhists have the Buddha Dhamma to think about — "lovely in the beginning,
 lovely in the middle, lovely in the ending." This as Dr.
 Henn Collins has pointed out is the true philosopher's stone whose alchemy
 will transmute the base metal of our ordinary consciousness into the gold
 of Enlightenment.

The Mastery of Pride
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Brian Fawcett
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(From "The Sangha," The Journal of the English Sangha Association, V.1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Few of us are free from Pride in one form or another.
 We know that in the interests of spiritual development it must be killed
 out.
 We are taught as much, and accept the teaching without question.
 But the method by which Pride may be eliminated is a problem not easy to
 solve, and the indirect, sweeping precepts of the sages are of little practical
 help to us.
 It is all very well saying: "Kill out this, and kill out that," but what
 we want to know is, how may we go about it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first place: what is Pride?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us call analogy to our aid.
 Regard pride as a weed, propagating itself with alarming fecundity in the
 garden of the mind.
 Its root is not visible, but the flowering shoots are in plain view.
 Cut down these shoots and either they grow again or the roots puts out
 new ones.
 The only way to destroy it is to dig it up altogether.
 That root is Self-Esteem.
 From it grow the roots of Conceit, Boastfulness, Ambition, Jealousy, Envy
 and Intolerance.
 There are others, but let us take these six manifestations for the sake
 of discussions.
 Unbiased, detached self-scrutiny will disclose what others may exist in
 one's own character, and it is unlikely that all will be found equally
 developed.
 There is cause for alarm when we discover them in ourselves.
 Pride is invariably despised when observed in others, yet we sometimes
 boast of possessing it.
 "I have my pride, you know," is a common assertion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beneath every manifestation of Pride, lies Self-Esteem.
 It is the conviction of superiority over others — the feeling that we are
 what they are not, or that we can do what they cannot do.
 Successes in early childhood may sow the seeds of it.
 The praise of relatives fosters it.
 Once planted, it grows, and not even the flattening criticism by one's
 own contemporaries in adolescence can stop it.
 By and by it becomes a habit to compare oneself with the people one meets
 or passes in the street, generally to their disadvantage.
 What we know of our own accomplishments is measured by what we presume
 they lack.
 We think we know our friends inside and out, and our judgments are based
 on a firm belief in the infallibility of our perception.
 There is a tendency to group those who are not obviously outstanding under
 the heading of "Ordinary People," and sometimes to place them in the inferior
 category for no more reason than that they look as if they belong there.
 How often we hear the remark: "He seems so ordinary, but when you get to
 know him there's a lot in him!" We are surprised to see our spot judgment
 wrong — that there really is something in that very ordinary-looking person.
 Can we honestly claim to be free of this habit of automatically comparing
 others with our own ideas of ourselves? If so, then Self-Esteem is not
 present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be bad enough if Pride flourished in no more then Self-Esteem,
 but it must manifest itself in every way it can.
 It strives to show on the surface, which is perhaps just as well, for then
 it becomes obvious.
 Conceit, first shoot of the weed Pride, is Self-Esteem manifesting in visible
 form.
 Not content with merely feeling superior to the people around us, we show
 it in our bearing.
 A glance from some passer-by of the opposite sex may be interpreted as
 a look of approval.
 The fine figure reflected in the shop window as we pass engenders a feeling
 of warm satisfaction.
 Smart clothes, we believe, do justice to our carriage.
 We may not be so tall as that person over yonder, but we have a more distinguis
hed look.
 No one would pick out any one of them in a crowd, but all can see we are
 different.
 Crude, isn't it? But that is the way Conceit affects us, and its crudity
 is indeed shocking when self-analysis brings us face to face with it.
 Inspired by a consciousness of a desire for Truth, our minds turn the searchlig
ht of enquiry inwards upon our own characters, and then there dawns the
 realization that Conceit has been part of us for as long as we remember.
 Formerly, we would have angrily denied the charge of being conceited.
 Now we see that it is well founded.
 Our "apartness," our treasured "individuality," is plainly one of its aspects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conceit has grown without its presence being suspected, and an even more
 dangerous and disgusting shoot has sprung up beside it.
 This is Boastfulness — Self-Esteem's oral manifestation.
 One of our national conventions is the taboo on bragging, and the idea
 of voicing a plain, undisguised boast would shock us as much as it would
 disgust the conventional listener.
 a very admirable convention too — but it by no means eliminates Boastfulness,
 for there are other ways of boasting, and as long as the desire to call
 attention to oneself exists, that particular ramification of Pride is a
 danger.
 We can get others to boast for us.
 We can also impress them (particulary our relations) that they sing our
 praises to others.
 In this way we gain more than were it to come from ourselves, and run no
 risk of its incurring disagreeable criticism.
 We can seek publicity and, once gained, declaim it.
 We may artfully bring a conversation round to a point at which we "modestly"
 have to admit to something we are really proud of.
 It takes a certain amount of courage to probe one's own secret heart and
 bring to light some of the many ways in which we who sincerely believe
 ourselves to be guiltless can actually indulge in Boastfulness.
 It is one of the most persistent roots of the weed of Pride, and the most
 dangerous because so frequently overlooked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two kinds of Ambition.
 There is Wrong Ambition, and Right Ambition.
 One is based on Self-Esteem; the other is free of any taint of it.
 Wrong Ambition is the desire to excel or succeed in order to enhance one's
 standing — one's reputation.
 It is the urge to achieve with the object of "putting the other chap's
 eye out!" In its more acceptable, and therefore more insidious aspect,
 it is the will to gain admiration and respect — to become, in fact, a worldly
 "success," which nearly always means a financial success.
 Confident of our great worth, we cannot be satisfied until repeated success
 have called the attention of others to it.
 We feel that wealth is a concrete recognition of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Ambition, on the other hand, is above itself.
 It is the will to succeed, not for the gratification of self-esteem, but
 to further achievement for its own sake.
 The painter who strives to express adequately the idea inspiring him —
 the poet who seeks to express an emotion as it has never been expressed
 — the craftsman ever intent on bettering his achievement — all are followers
 of Right Ambition.
 Their "selves" are forgotten.
 They work as instruments, and they feel that in the expression of their
 art is little personal, but rather a universal power whose tools they are.
 Noblest ambition of all is the desire to achieve an objective of disinterested
 service to one's fellow creatures, whether human or animal.
 it is sometimes gratifying to learn how many of us have this objective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jealousy might be defined as the resentment felt against another for competing
 at the same level.
 Note that it is at the same level that competition begets jealousy.
 An admission of inferiority by the other will quickly banish the jealousy
 we may feel against him.
 Those we admit to be our superiors do not arouse our jealousy.
 It is a bestial emotion, but one that undoubtedly had its uses in our passage
 through the lives in the Instinctive Mind, for it was an aid to our survival.
 Carried over into the influence of Intellect it has no place, and puts
 a drag on our upward progress.
 He who is at one moment the object of our jealousy, is regarded with affection
 once that jealousy has been smothered.
 What may has served us for the conservation of the means of life when we
 existed in a lower condition is now no more than a vehicle for Pride's
 manifestation, and its redundancy is obvious the moment the reason has
 torn Jealousy's red veil from the perception.
 We know it is useless, and long to rid ourselves of it.
 We seem to succeed, and then conditions come about favorable to its reappearanc
e, and the unwelcome pangs are felt again.
 Remember, then, that it is a shoot of Self-Esteem and until that root has
 been killed out the shoot may be beaten down only to blossom again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We joke about Envy, and are inclined to look on it as less despicable than
 Jealousy, its near relative.
 Think about it — think over and around it — define it to yourself — get
 to know it.
 When the nature of an unpleasant thing is known, it is less to be dreaded.
 With all these ramifications of the weed of Pride the same approach can
 be recommended.
 Define them to yourself.
 Figure out what they are and how much you are subject to their influence.
 Envy can be called the resentment felt against another for possessing that
 which one values and does not posses oneself.
 It may be only a gentle resentment sometimes, but is dangerous nevertheless,
 for it may become fierce.
 Underlying it is the feeling, "Why should he have it, and not I?" Self-Esteem
 is outraged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there is Intolerance.
 Sometimes it is the only form of Pride we are subject to.
 It is often the most robust shoot of the whole plant.
 It springs directly from Self-Esteem, for it is a refusal to accept anything
 that conflicts with our own ideas.
 It is to brand as wrong all that to us is not right.
 Intolerance causes us to condemn a person for doing that with which we
 disagree, but let him do just what we would do ourselves and — here is
 what is so unreasonable — a feeling of jealousy may be aroused.
 Pride sweeps us first one way, then another.
 There is no keeping our feet when once in its grasp.
 Don't expect Pride to be in any way "reasonable," for it wilts and disappears
 in the light of reason, its greatest foe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are repeatedly being asked: "Why carry the burden of Pride? Throw it
 aside! It is so much relief to rid yourselves of its weight and know the
 lightness of freedom!" We feel inclined to retort: " That's all very well,
 but how can we get rid of it? We know we must, but we don't know how to
 begin!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sickle which can cut down these roots is Reason — calm reflection —
 Meditation.
 Make it your task for a few weeks to give up half an hour daily for reasoning
 it out, and the results may amaze you.
 Look at yourself, as it were, from outside.
 Be honest with yourself, in making a searching examination to determine
 how Pride is manifesting through you, for fair self-analysis is in itself
 a powerful weapon to use against it.
 Classify those manifestations.
 Reason them out.
 Do they make sense? In your everyday life try and form the habit of watching
 with interest to spot each of Pride's several shoots as it appears, and
 once a week spend a meditation hour in asking yourself for a detailed report
 of every one noted.
 Form a picture in your mind of the perfect character, and compare your
 own character with it.
 For example, say to your self: "Now, I think there was an inclination to
 boast in my remark to Mrs.
 So-and-so at tea yesterday.
 How would the Ideal Being have acted under the circumstances?" Or again:
 "Would the Ideal Being have considered himself superior in bearing to those
 ugly people I passed in such-and-such a street? Of course not! He would
 have been above that." The power of standing apart from, and criticizing,
 the Ego who is subject to Pride, allows you to find satisfaction in adverse
 criticism from others.
 Whereas formerly you felt bitter if ridiculed or put "in the wrong," it
 now amuses you, for you see what good medicine it is for the Self you desire
 to set free.
 When others treat you with intolerance, welcome it, for they are doing
 you a favor by striking direct at your own intolerance.
 Seek those things which formerly aroused in you the pangs of Envy or Jealousy.
 Find pleasure in feeling that other self hurt by them, knowing that the
 wounds are suffered by the false Ego — Pride — and not by the real You.
 It will not be long before the pain is gone, and then you will have a good
 laugh at the memory of that squirming demon who fled surprised and vanquished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We who are subject to Conceit dread ridicule.
 Cease to dread it.
 When we see the wicked caricatures, or witness those vivid mimicries of
 ourselves, it is for us to welcome them, for they are aiding us materially
 in the conquest of Pride.
 So also, to hear ourselves belittled is an antidote for Boastfulness.
 When we do, there is no need to hide a raging heart behind a sickly smile.
 Once we have learned the trick of standing apart from ourselves these things
 can no longer hurt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But beat down the shoots of Pride as we may, we cannot be free from the
 weed until the root has gone.
 It is right to prevent the shoots from thriving.
 Destroy them by all means.
 But Pride will persist in making its appearance until Self-Esteem is rooted
 out — and to accomplish that is the hardest job of all!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a tip that may perhaps be of service.
 Try and form the habit of supposing every passer-by on whom the thoughts
 rest to be possessed of at least one attribute superior to your own.
 Think to yourself: "This creature isn't much to look at, but I'll bet she
 is far more even-tempered than I am!" Look at that rather foppish young
 man whose appearance used to annoy you, and think: "All the same, in a
 pinch he would show far greater physical courage than I." Cease to regard
 the large, loud-mouthed person as empty-headed, and think instead: "He's
 probably far cleverer with his hands than I." We are all learning our lessons
 in Life's school-room.
 Some are more advanced than us in one thing, and behind us in others.
 The person who cannot resist the temptation to gratify the senses may neverthel
ess be a good angel to others in need of help.
 The thief may be an actual hero.
 If we consistently regard others as possessing at least one of those desirable
 characteristics we ourselves are striving for, we are actually admitting
 our inferiority, and Self-Esteem suffers a staggering blow.
 Remember that Self-Esteem is a habit, and just as a habit must be acquired,
 so may it be abandoned.
 We are not born with it.
 We cultivate it by regarding ourselves as superior to others in some particular
 thing — later in more things — ultimately in everything.
 Kill it out by recognizing the superiority of others in some way.
 Credit them with that superiority, even though you don't know they possess
 it.
 Self-Esteem will die for lack of nourishment, and one day will come the
 first joyful realization that there is no Him nor Her nor You, but that
 we are all one.
 You need not fear going too far and acquiring an "inferiority complex."
 Your eyes will be open, and what you will find is True Humility.

An ancient maxim found in the Dhammapada sums up the practice of the Buddha's
 teaching in three simple guidelines to training: to abstain from all evil,
 to cultivate good, and to purify one's mind.
 These three principles form a graded sequence of steps progressing from
 the outward and preparatory to the inward and essential.
 Each step leads naturally into the one that follows it, and the culmination
 of the three in purification of mind makes it plain that the heart of Buddhist
 practice is to be found here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Purification of mind as understood in the Buddha's teaching is the sustained
 endeavor to cleanse the mind of defilements, those dark unwholesome mental
 forces which run beneath the surface stream of consciousness vitiating
 our thinking, values, attitudes, and actions.
 The chief among the defilements are the three that the Buddha has termed
 the "roots of evil" — greed, hatred, and delusion — from which emerge their
 numerous offshoots and variants: anger and cruelty, avarice and envy, conceit
 and arrogance, hypocrisy and vanity, the multitude of erroneous views.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contemporary attitudes do not look favorably upon such notions as defilement
 and purity, and on first encounter they may strike us as throwbacks to
 an outdated moralism, valid perhaps in an era when prudery and taboo were
 dominant, but having no claims upon us emancipated torchbearers of modernity.
 Admittedly, we do not all wallow in the mire of gross materialism and many
 among us seek our enlightenments and spiritual highs, but we want them
 on our own terms, and as heirs of the new freedom we believe they are to
 be won through an unbridled quest for experience without any special need
 for introspection, personal change, or self-control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, in the Buddha's teaching the criterion of genuine enlightenment
 lies precisely in purity of mind.
 The purpose of all insight and enlightened understanding is to liberate
 the mind from the defilements, and Nibbana itself, the goal of the teaching,
 is defined quite clearly as freedom from greed, hatred, and delusion.
 From the perspective of the Dhamma defilement and purity are not mere postulate
s of a rigid authoritarian moralism but real and solid facts essential to
 a correct understanding of the human situation in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As facts of lived experience, defilement and purity pose a vital distinction
 having a crucial significance for those who seek deliverance from suffering.
 They represent the two points between which the path to liberation unfolds
 — the former its problematic and starting point, the latter its resolution
 and end.
 The defilements, the Buddha declares, lie at the bottom of all human suffering.
 Burning within as lust and craving, as rage and resentment, they lay to
 waste hearts, lives, hopes, and civilizations, and drive us blind and thirsty
 through the round of birth and death.
 The Buddha describes the defilements as bonds, fetters, hindrances, and
 knots; thence the path to unbonding, release, and liberation, to untying
 the knots, is at the same time a discipline aimed at inward cleansing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work of purification must be undertaken in the same place where the
 defilements arise, in the mind itself, and the main method the Dhamma offers
 for purifying the mind is meditation.
 Meditation, in the Buddhist training, is neither a quest for self-effusive
 ecstasies nor a technique of home-applied psychotherapy, but a carefully
 devised method of mental development — theoretically precise and practically
 efficient — for attaining inner purity and spiritual freedom.
 The principal tools of Buddhist meditation are the core wholesome mental
 factors of energy, mindfulness, concentration, and understanding.
 But in the systematic practice of meditation, these are strengthened and
 yoked together in a program of self-purification which aims at extirpating
 the defilements root and branch so that not even the subtlest unwholesome
 stirrings remain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since all defiled states of consciousness are born from ignorance, the most
 deeply embedded defilement, the final and ultimate purification of mind
 is to be accomplished through the instrumentality of wisdom, the knowledge
 and vision of things as they really are.
 Wisdom, however, does not arise through chance or random good intentions,
 but only in a purified mind.
 Thus in order for wisdom to come forth and accomplish the ultimate purification
 through the eradication of defilements, we first have to create a space
 for it by developing a provisional purification of mind — a purification
 which, though temporary and vulnerable, is still indispensable as a foundation
 for the emergence of all liberative insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The achievement of this preparatory purification of mind begins with the
 challenge of self-understanding.
 To eliminate defilements we must first learn to know them, to detect them
 at work infiltrating and dominating our everyday thoughts and lives.
 For countless eons we have acted on the spur of greed, hatred, and delusion,
 and thus the work of self-purification cannot be executed hastily, in obedience
 to our demand for quick results.
 The task requires patience, care, and persistence — and the Buddha's crystal
 clear instructions.
 For every defilement the Buddha in his compassion has given us the antidote,
 the method to emerge from it and vanquish it.
 By learning these principles and applying them properly, we can gradually
 wear away the most stubborn inner stains and reach the end of suffering,
 the "taintless liberation of the mind."

Nourishing the Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The course of spiritual training taught by the Buddha is a double process
 of self-transformation and self-transcendence issuing in complete emancipation
 from suffering.
 The process of self-transformation involves the elimination of unwholesome
 mental dispositions and their replacement by pure dispositions conducing
 to the benefit of oneself and others; the process of self-transcendence
 focuses on the abandoning of egocentric notions by seeing with direct insight
 the essenceless nature of the bodily and mental processes we normally take
 to be "I" and "mine." When this double process is brought to its culmination,
 suffering is extinguished, for with the awakening of wisdom the basic root
 of suffering — craving backed by blinding ignorance — falls away never
 to rise again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the unwholesome tendencies and selfish clinging spring from seeds
 buried deep in the bottom-most strata of the mind, to eradicate these sources
 of affliction and nurture the growth of the liberating vision of reality
 the Buddha presents his teaching in the form of a gradual training.
 Buddhist discipline involves gradual practice and gradual attainment.
 It does not burst into completeness at a stroke, but like a tree or any
 other living organism, it unfolds organically, as a sequence of stages
 in which each stage rests upon its predecessor as its indispensable foundation
 and gives rise to its successor as its natural consequent.
 The principal stages of this gradual training are three: the training in
 sila or virtue, the training in samadhi or concentration, and the training
 in pañña or wisdom.
 If we follow through the comparison of the Buddhist discipline to a tree,
 faith (saddha) would be the seed, for it is faith that provides the initial
 impulse through which the training is taken up, and faith again that nourishes
 the training through every phase of its development.
 Virtue would be the roots, for it is virtue that gives grounding to our
 spiritual endeavors just as the roots give grounding to a tree.
 Concentration would be the trunk, the symbol of strength, non-vacillation,
 and stability.
 And wisdom would be the branches, which yield the flowers of enlightenment
 and the fruits of deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vigour of the spiritual life, like the vigour of a tree, depends upon
 healthy roots.
 Just as a tree with weak and shallow roots cannot flourish but will grow
 up stunted, withered and barren, so a spiritual life devoid of strong roots
 will also have a stunted growth incapable of bearing fruit.
 To attempt to scale the higher stages of the path it is essential at the
 outset to nourish the proper roots of the path; otherwise the result will
 be frustration, disillusionment, and perhaps even danger.
 The roots of the path are the constituents of sila, the factors of moral
 virtue.
 These are the basis for meditation, the ground for all wisdom and higher
 achievement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To say that sila is the precondition for success, however, does not mean,
 as is too often believed in conservative Buddhist circles, that one cannot
 begin to meditate until one's sila is perfect.
 Such a stipulation would make it almost impossible to start meditation,
 since it is the mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom of the meditative
 process that bring about the gradual purification of virtue.
 But to say that virtue is the basis of practice does mean that the capacity
 for achievement in meditation hinges upon the purity of our sila.
 If our roots of virtue are weak, our meditation will likewise be weak.
 If our actions repeatedly clash with the basic principles of right conduct,
 our attempts to control the mind in the discipline of meditation will turn
 into a self-defeating enterprise, since the springs of our conduct will
 be the same defiled states of mind the meditation is intended to eliminate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only when we secure our cultivation upon the foundation of blameless principles
 of right action can the inward endeavor of meditation prosper and issue
 in success.
 With true principles of conduct as the base, the roots of virtue will give
 birth to the trunk of concentration, the concentrated mind shoot forth
 the branches of wisdom, and the branches of wisdom yield the flowers and
 fruits of enlightenment, culminating in total freedom from bondage.
 Therefore, just as a skillful gardener brings a sapling to growth by first
 tending to the roots, so the earnest seeker of enlightenment should begin
 his cultivation by tending to the roots of his practice — that is, to his
 sila or moral virtue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pali word sila originally meant simply conduct.
 But in the context of the Buddhist spiritual training the term is used
 to signify only a specific kind of conduct, i.e., good conduct, and by an
 extension of meaning, the type of character for which such conduct stands,
 i.e., good character.
 Hence sila means both moral conduct, a body of habits governed by moral
 principles, and moral virtue, the interior quality the regular observance
 of these principles is intended to produce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both shades of meaning are essential to understand the place of sila in
 the spectrum of Buddhist discipline.
 Sila in the former sense consists in the non-transgression through body
 or speech of the basic precepts regulating the moral life.
 It is moral discipline in deed and word, beginning as the inhibition of
 immoral impulses seeking an outlet through body and speech, and developing
 into the habitual conformation to the principles of righteous conduct.
 But the full range of sila is not exhausted by mere outward behavioral
 control, for the term has in addition a deeper, more psychological significance.
 In this second sense sila is moral purity, the inner purification of character
 which results from a life consistently moulded upon moral principles.
 This aspect of sila places the stress on the subjective, motivational side
 of action.
 It looks not towards the outward act itself, but towards the rectitude
 of mind from which good conduct springs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon inspection sila thus reveals itself to be a two- dimensional quality:
 it contains an external dimension consisting in purification of conduct,
 and an internal dimension consisting in purification of character.
 However, in the Teaching of the Buddha, these two dimensions of experience,
 the internal and the external, are not torn apart and consigned to separate,
 self-sufficient domains.
 They are recognized, rather, to be two facets of a single whole, complementary
 poles of a unified field which mirror one another, implicate one another,
 and penetrate one another with their own respective potentialities of influence.
 Actions performed by body and speech are not, from the Buddhist standpoint,
 so many detachable appendages of a distinct spiritual essence, but concrete
 revelations of the states of mind which stand behind them as their activating
 source.
 And states of mind, in turn, do not remain closed up in a purely mental
 isolation, but spill forth according to the play of circumstances from
 the fountain of consciousness where they arise, through the channels of
 body, speech and thought, out into the world of inter-personally significant
 events.
 From the action we can infer the state of mind, and from the state of mind
 we can predict the probable course of action.
 The relationship between the two is as integral as that between a musical
 score and its orchestrated performance on the concert stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this mutual dependence of the two domains, moral conduct and
 purity of character lock up with one another in a subtle and complex interrelat
ionship.
 The fulfillment of the purification of virtue requires that both aspects
 of sila be realized: on the one side, behavior of body and speech must
 be brought into accord with the moral ideal; on the other, the mental dispositi
on must be cleansed of its corruptions until it is impeccably pure.
 The former without the latter is insufficient; the latter without the former
 is impossible.
 Between the two, the internal aspect is the more important from the standpoint
 of spiritual development, since bodily and verbal deeds acquire ethical
 significance primarily as expressions of a corresponding disposition of
 mind.
 In the sequence of spiritual training, however, it is moral discipline
 that comes first.
 For at the beginning of training, purification of character stands as an
 ideal which must be reached; it is not a reality with which one can start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the Buddhist principle of conditionality, the actualization
 of any given state is only possible through the actualization of its appropriat
e conditions, and this applies as much to the achievement of the various
 stages of the training as to the bare phenomena of matter and mind.
 Since beginningless time the consciousness-continuum has been corrupted
 by the unwholesome roots of greed, hatred and delusion; it is these defilements
 which have functioned as the source for the greatest number of our thoughts,
 the ground for our habits, and the springs for our actions and general
 orientation towards other people and the world as a whole.
 To uproot these defiling afflictions at a single stroke and reach the peak
 of spiritual perfection by a mere act of will is a well-near impossible
 task.
 A realistic system of spiritual training must work with the raw material
 of human nature; it cannot rest content merely with postulated paragons
 of human excellence or demands for achievement without showing the method
 by which such demands can be realized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha rests his teaching upon the thesis that with the right method
 we have the capacity to change and transform ourselves.
 We are not doomed to be for ever burdened by the weight of accumulated
 tendencies, but through our own effort we can cast off all these tendencies
 and attain a condition of complete purity and freedom.
 When given the proper means in the context of right understanding, we can
 bring about radical alterations in the workings of consciousness and mould
 a new shape out of the seemingly immutable stuff of our own minds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step on this path is the purification of character, and the efficient
 means for the restructuring of character the Buddha provides in the observance
 of sila as a set of precepts regulating bodily and verbal conduct.
 Sila as moral discipline, in other words, becomes the means for inducing
 sila as moral virtue.
 The effectiveness of this measure stems from the reciprocal interlocking
 of the internal and external spheres of experience already referred to.
 Because the inner and outer domains are mutually implicated, the one can
 become the means for producing deep and lasting changes in the other.
 Just as a state of mind expresses itself outwardly in an action — in deed
 or speech — so too the avoidance and performance of certain actions can
 recoil upon the mind and alter the basic disposition of the mental life.
 If mental states dominated by greed and hatred can engender deeds of killing,
 stealing, lying, etc., then the abstinence on principle from killing, stealing
 and lying can engender a mental disposition towards kindliness, contentment,
 honesty and truthfulness.
 Thus, although sila as moral purity may not be the starting point of spiritual
 training, conformity to righteous standards of conduct can make it an attainabl
e end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The medium which bridges the two dimensions of sila, facilitating the translatio
n of outward behavior into inner purity, is volition or cetana.
 Volition is a mental factor common to every occasion of experience, a universal
 concomitant of every act of consciousness.
 It is the factor which makes experience teleological, i.e., oriented to a
 goal, since its specific function is to direct its associated factors towards
 the attainment of a particular end.
 All action (kamma), the Buddha teaches, is in essence volition, for the
 act itself is from the ultimate standpoint a manifestation of volition
 through one of the three doors of action — body, speech or mind: "It is
 volition, bhikkhus, that I call action.
 For having willed, one performs an action through body, speech, or mind."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Volition determines an action as being of a definite sort, and thence imparts
 to action its moral significance.
 But since volition is invariably present in every state of consciousness,
 it is in its own nature without ethical distinctiveness.
 Volition acquires its distinctive ethical quality from certain other mental
 factors known as roots (mula), in association with which it always arises
 on occasions of active experience.
 Roots are of two morally determinate kinds: unwholesome (akusala) and wholesome
 (kusala).
 The unwholesome roots are greed, hatred and delusion; the wholesome roots
 are non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion.
 These latter, though expressed negatively, signify not merely the absence
 of the defiling factors, but the presence of positive moral qualities as
 well; generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When volition is driven by the unwholesome roots of greed, hatred and delusion,
 it breaks out through the doors of the body and speech in the form of evil
 deeds — as killing, stealing and fornication, as lying, slander, harsh
 speech and gossip.
 In this way the inner world of mental defilement darkens the outer world
 of spatio-temporal extension.
 But the defiled trend of volitional movement, though strong, is not irrevocable.
 Unwholesome volition can be supplanted by wholesome volition, and thence
 the entire disposition of the mental life made subject to a reversal at
 its foundation.
 This redirecting of volition is initiated by voluntarily undertaking the
 observance of principles of conduct belonging to a righteous order — by
 willing to abstain from evil and to practice the good.
 Then, when volition tending to break out as evil action is restrained and
 replaced by volition of the opposite kind, by the will to behave virtuously
 in word and deed, a process of reversal will have been started which, if
 followed through, can produce far-reaching alterations in the moral tone
 of character.
 For acts of volition do not spend their full force in their immediate exercise,
 but rebound upon the mental current which gave birth to them, re-orienting
 that current in the direction towards which they point as their own immanent
 tendency: the unwholesome volitions towards moral depravation, and the
 wholesome volitions towards moral purification.
 Each time, therefore, an unwholesome volition is supplanted by its wholesome
 opposite, the will to the good is strengthened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A process of factor substitution, built upon the law that incompatible mental
 qualities cannot be simultaneously present on a single occasion of experience,
 then completes the transformation through the efficacity of the associated
 roots.
 Just as unwholesome volitions invariably arise in association with the
 unwholesome roots — with greed, hatred and delusion — so do wholesome volitions
 inevitably bring along with them as their concomitants the wholesome roots
 of non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion.
 Since opposite qualities cannot co-exist, the replacement of unwholesome
 volition by wholesome volition at the same time means the transposition
 of the unwholesome and the wholesome roots.
 Continually called into play by the surge of volition, the wholesome roots
 "perfume" the mental stream with the qualities for which they stand — with
 generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom; and these, as they gather cumulative
 force, come to prominence as regular propensities of the personality, eclipsing
 the inclination towards the unwholesome.
 In this way the exercise of wholesome volitions on repeated and varied
 occasions effects a transformation of character from its initial moral
 susceptibility to a pitch of purity where even the temptation to evil remains
 at a safe remove.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though volition or cetana is the primary instrument of change, the will
 in itself is indeterminate, and requires specific guidelines to direct
 its energy towards the actualization of the good.
 A mere "good will,' from the Buddhist standpoint, is altogether inadequate,
 for despite the nobility of the intention, as long as the intelligence
 of the agent is clouded with the dust of delusion, the possibility always
 lies open that laudable motives might express themselves in foolish or
 even destructive courses of action.
 This has been the case often enough in the past, and still stands as the
 perennial bugbear of the ethical generalist.
 According to the Buddhist outlook, goodness of will must be translated
 into concrete courses of action.
 It must be regulated by specific principles of right conduct, principles
 which, though flexible in their application, possess normative validity
 independently of any historical culture or existing scheme of values, entirely
 by virtue of their relation to a universal law of moral retribution and
 their place in the timeless path of practice leading to deliverance from
 suffering and the samsaric round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To guide the will in its aspiration for the good, the Buddha has prescribed
 in definite and lucid terms the factors of moral training which must be
 fulfilled to safeguard progress along the path to enlightenment.
 These factors are comprised in the three items which make up the aggregate
 of virtue in the Noble Eightfold Path: namely, right speech, right action,
 and right livelihood.
 Right speech is the avoidance of all harmful forms of speech — the abstinence
 from falsehood, slander, harsh speech and idle chatter.
 The speech of the aspirant must be constantly truthful, conducive to harmony,
 gentle and meaningful.
 Right action applies a brake upon unwholesome bodily action, by prescribing
 abstinence from the destruction of life, from stealing, and from sexual
 misconduct; the latter means incelibacy in the case of monks, and adultery
 and other illicit relations in the case of householders.
 The behavior of the aspirant must always be compassionate, honest and pure.
 And right livelihood requires the avoidance of trades which inflict harm
 and suffering upon other living beings, such as dealing in meat, slaves,
 weapons, poisons and intoxicants.
 Avoiding such harmful trades, the noble disciple earns his living by a
 peaceful and righteous occupation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The training factors embedded in these components of the Noble Eightfold
 Path simultaneously inhibit the base, ignoble and destructive impulses
 of the human mind and promote the performance of whatever is noble and
 pure.
 Though worded negatively, in terms of the types of conduct they are intended
 to shut out, they are positive in effect, for when adopted as guidelines
 to action, they stimulate the growth of healthy mental attitudes which
 come to expression as beneficient courses of conduct.
 Intensively, these training rules reach into the recesses of the mind,
 blunt the force of unwholesome volition, and redirect the will to the attainmen
t of the good.
 Extensively, they reach into the commotion of man's social existence, and
 arrest the tide of competition, exploitation, grasping, violence and war.
 In their psychological dimension they confer mental health, in their social
 dimension they promote peace, in their spiritual dimension they serve as
 the irreplaceable foundation for all higher progress along the path to
 emancipation.
 Regularly undertaken and put into practice, they check all mental states
 rooted in greed, hatred and delusion, promote actions rooted in non-greed,
 non-hatred and non-delusion, and lead to a life of charity, love and wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this it will be seen that from the Buddhist point of view formulated
 rules of conduct are not superfluous accessories to a good will, but necessary
 guidelines to right action.
 They are an essential part of the training, and when implemented by the
 force of volition, become a fundamental means to purification.
 Especially in the context of the practice of meditation, the training precepts
 prevent the eruption of defiled actions destructive to the purpose of the
 meditative discipline.
 By following carefully the prescribed rules of conduct, we can rest assured
 that we are avoiding at least the coarser expressions of greed, hatred
 and delusion, and that we will not have to face the obstacle of guilt,
 anxiety and restlessness that comes in the trail of regular moral transgression
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we return to our earlier comparison of the Buddhist discipline to a tree,
 and take virtue to be the roots, then the principles of right conduct become
 the soil in which the roots grow.
 Just as the soil contains the nutritive essences required for the tree
 to sprout and flourish, so do the precepts contain the nutriment of purity
 and virtue required for the growth of the spiritual life.
 The precepts embody the natural conduct of the arahant or perfected saint.
 For the arahant, his conduct flows outward as the spontaneous expression
 of his innate purity.
 By his very nature, all his deeds are flawless, free from blemish.
 He cannot follow any course of action motivated by desire, ill will, delusion
 or fear — not through any forced conformity to rules, but by the very law
 of his being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The worldling, however, is not immune from the possibility of immoral conduct.
 To the contrary, because the unwholesome roots remain firmly planted in
 the makeup of his mind, he is constantly prone to the temptation to moral
 transgression.
 He is liable to kill, steal, commit adultery, lie, drink, etc.; and in the
 absence of any sound moral code prohibiting such actions, he will often
 succumb to these liabilities.
 Hence the necessity of providing him with a set of ethical principles built
 upon the pillars of wisdom and compassion, by which he can regulate his
 actions and conform to the natural, spontaneous behavior of the Liberated
 One.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A precept is, therefore, from the Buddhist perspective much more than a
 prohibition imposed upon conduct from without.
 Each precept is a tangible expression of a corresponding attitude of mind,
 a principle which clothes in the form of concrete action a beam of the
 light of inward purity.
 The precepts render visible the invisible state of purification.
 They make it accessible to us by refracting it through the media of body
 and speech into specific rules of conduct we can apply as guides to action
 when we find ourselves in the diverse situations they are designed to cover.
 By bringing our conduct into harmony with the precepts, we can nourish
 the root of our spiritual endeavors, our virtue.
 And when virtue is made secure, the succeeding stages of the path unfold
 spontaneously through the law of the spiritual life, culminating at the
 crest in the perfection of knowledge and the serene azure of deliverance.

Mind and the Animate Order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we cast our gaze out upon the landscape of animate nature, it does not
 take long before our attention is struck by the tremendous diversity of
 forms the animate order displays.
 The folds of nature's lap, we find, teem with a multitude of living beings
 as staggering in their range of specific differentiation as in the sheer
 impression of their quantitative force.
 Before our eyes countless varieties of creatures — insects and reptiles,
 fish and birds, mammals domestic and wild — turn the earth With its seas
 and skies into a complex metropolis, throbbing with the pulse of sentient
 life.
 But realms of being beyond sight — vouched for by spiritual cosmology,
 folklore, and the reports of seers — are no less crowded, and no less diversifi
ed in their composition.
 According to this testimony, gods, Brahmas, angels and demons populate
 boroughs of the city of life invisible to fleshly eyes, while other creatures,
 such as fairies, ghosts and goblins, fill up unfamiliar pockets of the
 same borough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The human world, again, is itself far from homogeneous.
 The family of man breaks down into a great diversity of types — into people
 black, white, brown, yellow and red, dividing still further, according
 to their fortunes and faculties, into the long-lived and the short-lived,
 the healthy and the sickly, the successful and the failures, the gifted
 and the deprived.
 Some people are intelligent, others are dull-witted, some are noble, others
 ignoble, some are spiritually evolved, others spiritually destitute.
 Human beings range all the way from mental retards who can manage their
 bodily needs only with great difficulty, to sages and saints who can comprehend
 the deepest secrets of the universe and lift the moral outlook of their
 less acute brothers and sisters to heights undreamed of in the common stream
 of thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the thinker who would dig below the surface presentations and discover
 the reasons for the manifest phenomena, the question naturally arises why
 life exhibits itself in such variegated apparel.
 Reflection upon this question has given birth to a multitude of schools
 of thought, religious and philosophical, each offering its own speculations
 as the key to unravel the riddle of nature's kaleidoscopic design.
 In the intellectual history of humanity, the two dominant positions around
 which these schools cluster are theism and materialism.
 Pitted against one another by their antithetical tenets, the two have come
 down in different guises from ancient times even to the present.
 Theism refers the diversity of sentient life, including the disparities
 of fortune evident in the human world, to the will of God.
 It is God, the theist holds, the omnipotent, omniscient author of the universe,
 who creates through the fiat of his will the variety of natural forms,
 allots to beings their respective shares of happiness and suffering, and
 divides people into the high and the low, the fortunate and the miserable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Materialism, in contradistinction, rules out any recourse to an extraterrestrial
 agency to account for the differentiation in the faculties and capacities
 found amongst living beings, and attempts to provide in its place a system
 of explanation which works exclusively with naturalistic principles, pertaining
 to the material order.
 The entire gamut of living forms together with all life's modes of expression,
 the materialist claims, can be effectively reduced in the end to the adventures
 of matter governed by physical, chemical and biological laws.
 Even consciousness represents, for the materialist, only a secondary superstruc
ture built upon a material base devoid of any larger significance in itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not our present purpose here to examine at length these two rival
 doctrines.
 Let it suffice to note that both, in different ways, throw into jeopardy
 the postulate of a progressive spiritual evolution of beings by withholding,
 implicitly or explicitly, the necessary condition for such a course of
 evolution — namely, an inwardly autonomous will which finds in the diversity
 of the sentient order the field for the working out of its own potentialities
 for growth and transformation, in accordance with laws governing freely
 chosen possibilities of action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theism withholds this condition by its basic postulate of an omnipotent
 deity directing the entire field of nature from above.
 If all of nature runs its course in obedience to divine command, then the
 individual will, which belongs to the natural order, must be subject to
 the same divine supervision as the rest of animate nature.
 The autonomy of the individual will and its direct impact on the sentient
 sphere are excluded, and with them also goes the thesis of a genuine long-term
 spiritual growth, to which they are essential.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Materialism likewise shuts out the notion of a progressive spiritual evolution
 of beings, but more simply and directly, by explicitly denying the basic
 presupposition of such a notion.
 The will's claim to freedom is here rejected, its autonomy usurped by the
 irresistible pressure of the determinative influences at its base.
 Consciousness becomes a mere by-product of material processes; the individual
 life-stream leaves no impact on any continuous current of experience enduring
 beyond the grave.
 Both conscious action and evolution in the biotic sphere proceed in the
 grip of the same play of cosmic forces — blind, brute, and insentient in
 their fundamental mode of operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddhism also offers an explanation for the diversity of the sentient order,
 an explanation which bridges the gap between volition and the diversity
 and thus opens up the prospect for long-term spiritual development.
 According to Buddhism, the explanation for the variegation of sentient
 beings — in their kinds, faculties, and fortunes — lies in their kamma,
 that is, their volitional action.
 Beings are, in the words of the Buddha, "heirs of their action." They spring
 forth from their store of accumulated action as a matrix out of which they
 are fashioned, inheriting the results proper to their deeds even across
 the gulf of lifetimes.
 Through the succession of life-terms, kamma holds sway over the individual
 evolutionary current.
 Acts of will, once completed, recede into the forward moving mental stream
 out of which they emerged, and remaining in the form of psychic potencies,
 pilot the future course of evolution to be taken by that particular current
 of experience called an "individual being." Just as the kamma rises up out
 of the stream of consciousness, so does the stream of consciousness again
 flow forth from the germinative kamma, which thus serves to link into a
 single chain the series of separated lives.
 The kammic force drives the current of consciousness onward into new modes
 of existence conformable to its nature; it determines the specific form
 of life in which the individual will take remanifestation, the set of faculties
 with which the new being will be endowed, and a substantial portion of
 the happiness and suffering that being will meet during the course of its
 life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is, therefore, not God or chance in the Buddhist picture, but the differentia
tion in volitional action, functioning across the succession of lives, that
 accounts for the differentiation in the animate order, and the differentiation
 in action again that divides beings into the high and low, the happy and
 the miserable, the gifted and the deprived.
 As the Buddha declares: "Beings are the owners of their actions, heirs
 of their actions.
 Their action is the source from which they spring, their kinsman and their
 refuge.
 Action divides beings into the inferior and the superior."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the effective determinant of destiny is kamma, and kamma is essentially
 volition, this means that the operative factor in the formation of future
 becoming is lodged in the individual will.
 The will, from the Buddhist perspective, is no accidental offshoot of the
 machinery of nature, compelled to its course by the conspiracy of cosmic
 forces; it is, rather, in the deepest sense the artisan behind the entire
 process of animate evolution.
 Here will is primary and the material factors secondary, the plastic substance
 with which the will works and by which it gives tangible expression to
 its store of dispositional tendencies.
 The varied landscape of sentient existence, for Buddhism, represents but
 an outward register of the inward transactions of the will, and the hierarchy
 of living forms — the "great chain of being" — but a congellation of its
 functional modalities in the world of spatio-temporal extension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differentiation in the biological sphere is thus preceded and paralleled
 by a set of transformations in the mental sphere, which finds in animate
 nature the channel for actualizing its own potentialities throughout the
 series of successive becomings comprising the individual continuum.
 Through the exercise of our will, therefore, we build for ourselves our
 own world independent of coercion by extrinsic forces and mould the destiny
 that awaits us in time to come, whether for happiness or misery, for bondage
 or liberation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the spiritual aspirant, however, it is not sufficient merely to understand
 the theoretical ground for the differentiation of living beings.
 For us it is of the utmost importance to know what we can do to further
 our own progress along the scale of spiritual evolution — to advance to
 higher levels of attainment during the course of our earthly life, to secure
 a rebirth conducive to spiritual growth in the life to come, and ultimately
 to transcend this repetitive cycle of birth and death and attain Nibbana,
 the supreme and irreversible deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer to this problem begins with the fact that kamma divides itself,
 according to its moral quality, into two types — the unwholesome (akusala)
 and the wholesome (kusala).
 Unwholesome kamma is action — physical, verbal or mental — that springs
 from the three unwholesome roots of action: greed (lobha), hatred (dosa)
 and delusion (moha).
 Any action grounded in these roots is spiritually detrimental and morally
 defective.
 It destroys the higher faculties, entails suffering as its consequence,
 and causes a plunge into lower states of existence; in short, it brings
 decline along the scale of spiritual evolution and deeper immersion in
 the mire of phenomenal existence.
 Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action springing from the three
 contrary wholesome roots — non-greed (alobha), non-hatred (adosa) and non-delus
ion (amoha), finding positive expression in the qualities of charity, loving-kin
dness and wisdom, respectively.
 Wholesome action functions in a way diametrically opposite to its dark
 counterpart.
 It is spiritually beneficial and morally commendable, stimulates the unfolding
 of the higher faculties, and entails happiness both in the present and
 in time to come.
 Consistently practiced, it promotes progress along the evolutionary scale,
 leading to higher states of existence in successive life-spans, and finally
 to the realization of deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On ultimate analysis, life is a self-regenerating sequence of occasions
 of experience, comprising occasions of action and occasions of reception.
 Action is volition, and volition inevitably involves decision or choice
 — a selection from the welter of possibilities open to the will of that
 alternative most, conformable to the individual's purpose, a selection
 even, at a higher level, of the purposes themselves.
 Every moment of morally significant action, therefore, confronts us with
 the call for a decision, with the necessity for choice.
 Choice must work within the gamut of options open to the will, and these
 options, despite their great differences of qualitative character, necessarily
 fall into one of two classes according to their ethical nature — into the
 wholesome or the unwholesome.
 The one leads to progress, the other to decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thence progress or decline depends entirely upon our choice, and not upon
 any external agency whether conceived in spiritualistic or materialistic
 garb.
 Through our fleeting, momentary decisions, accumulated over long periods,
 we model our fortune and chisel out of the unshaped block of futurity the
 destiny that will befall us in the span of time to come.
 Each call for a decision may be depicted as a ladder, one end leading upward
 to unknown heights, and the other extending downward into forbidding depths,
 while our successive decisions may be taken as the steps that lead us up
 or down the ladder's graded rungs.
 Or again, each moment of action may be compared to a crossroad at which
 we stand, a forked road one side of which leads to a city of bliss and
 the other to a swampland of misery and despair.
 The two roads stand, fixed and silent, awaiting our choice, and only our
 decision determines whether we shall reach the one destination or the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sum, then, it is our kamma that precipitates our destiny, for it is kamma
 that brings about manifestation of all the destinations (gati) or realms
 of sentient existence, and kamma ultimately that fashions the entire variegated
 landscape of sentient existence itself, according to the ethical tone of
 its associated moral roots.
 As the Exalted One explains, speaking not through speculation but through
 his own direct penetration of the paths leading to all destinations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not celestial beings (deva), or humans, or any other creatures belonging
 to happy forms of existence, that appear through action (kamma) born of
 greed, born of hate, born of delusion; it is rather beings of the hells,
 of the animal kingdom, of the ghostly realm, or any other others of miserable
 form of existence that make their appearance through action born of greed,
 hate and delusion...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not creatures of the hells, of the animal kingdom, of the ghostly
 realm, or any others of a miserable form of existence, that appear through
 action born of non-greed, born of non-hate, born of non-delusion; it is
 rather celestial beings, humans, or any other creatures belonging to a
 happy form of existence that make their appearance through action born
 of non-greed, non-hate, and non-delusion.

\begin_layout Standard
Merit and Spiritual Growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The performance of deeds of merit forms one of the most essential elements
 of Buddhist practice.
 Its various modes provide in their totality a compendium of applied Buddhism,
 showing Buddhism not as a system of ideas but as a complete way of life.
 Buddhist popular belief has often emphasized merit as a productive source
 of worldly blessings — of health, wealth, long life, beauty and friends.
 As a result of this emphasis, meritorious activity has come to be conceived
 rather in terms of a financial investment, as a religious business venture
 yielding returns to the satisfaction of the agent's mundane desires.
 While such a conception no doubt contains an element of truth, its popularizati
on has tended to eclipse the more important function merit plays in the
 context of Buddhist practice.
 Seen in correct perspective, merit is an essential ingredient in the harmony
 and completeness of the spiritual life, a means of self-cultivation, and
 an indispensable stepping-stone to spiritual progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accumulation of a "stock of merit" is a primary requisite for acquiring
 all the fruits of the Buddhist religious life, from a pleasant abiding
 here and now to a favorable rebirth in the life to come, from the initial
 stages of meditative progress to the realization of the states of sanctity
 that come as the fruits of entering upon the noble path.
 The highest fruition of merit is identical with the culmination of the
 Buddhist holy life itself — that is, emancipation from the shackles of
 samsaric existence and the realization of Nibbana, the unconditioned state
 beyond the insubstantial phenomena of the world.
 The mere piling up of merit, to be sure, is not in itself sufficient to
 guarantee the attainment of this goal.
 Merit is only one requisite, and it must be balanced by its counterpart
 to secure the breakthrough from bondage to final freedom.
 The counterpart of merit is knowledge (ñana), the direct confrontation
 with the basic truths of existence through the eye of intuitive wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Merit and knowledge together constitute the two sets of equipment the spiritual
 aspirant requires in the quest for deliverance, the equipment of merit
 (puññasambhara) and the equipment of knowledge (ñanasambhara), respectively.
 Each set of equipment has its own contribution to make to the fulfillment
 of the spiritual life.
 The equipment of merit facilitates progress in the course of samsaric wandering
: it brings a favorable rebirth, the encounter with good friends to guide
 one's footsteps along the path, the meeting with opportunities for spiritual
 growth, the flowering of the lofty qualities of character, and the maturation
 of the spiritual faculties required for the higher attainments.
 The equipment of knowledge brings the factor directly necessary for cutting
 the bonds of samsaric existence: the penetration of truth, enlightenment,
 the undistorted comprehension of the nature of actuality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Either set of equipment, functioning in isolation, is insufficient to the
 attainment of the goal; either pursued alone leads to a deviant, one-sided
 development that departs from the straight path to deliverance taught by
 the Buddha.
 Merit without knowledge produces pleasant fruit and a blissful rebirth,
 but cannot issue in the transcendence of the mundane order and entrance
 upon the supramundane path.
 And knowledge without the factors of merit deteriorates into dry intellectualis
m, mere erudition or scholasticism, impotent when confronted with the task
 of grasping a truth outside the pale of intellection.
 But when they function together in unison in the life of the aspirant,
 the two sets of equipment acquire a potency capable of propelling him to
 the heights of realization.
 When each set of equipment complements the other, polishes the other, and
 perfects the other, then they undergo a graduated course of mutual purification
 culminating at the crest in the twin endowments of the Emancipated One
 — in that clear knowledge (vijja) and flawless conduct (carana) which make
 him, in the words of the Buddha, "supreme among gods and humans."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But while merit and knowledge thus occupy coordinate positions, it is merit
 that claims priority from the standpoint of spiritual dynamics.
 The reason is that works of merit come first in the process of inner growth.
 If knowledge be the flower that gives birth to the fruit of liberation,
 and faith (saddha) the seed out of which the flower unfolds, then merit
 is the soil, water and fertilizer all in one — the indispensable nutriment
 for every stage of growth.
 Merit paves the way for knowledge, and finds in knowledge the sanction
 for its own claim to a place in the system of Buddhist training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for this particular sequential structure is closely linked to
 the Buddhist conception of noetic realization.
 From the Buddhist standpoint the comprehension of spiritual truth is not
 a matter of mere intellectual cogitation but of existential actualization.
 That is, it is a matter of grasping with our whole being the truth towards
 which we aspire, and of inwardly appropriating that truth in a manner so
 total and complete that our being becomes transformed into a very reflex
 and effusion of the truth upon which we stand.
 The understanding of truth in the context of the spiritual life, in other
 words, is no affair of accumulating bits and pieces of information publicly
 accessible and subjectively indifferent; it is, rather, a process of uncovering
 the deepest truths about ourselves and about the world, and of working
 the understanding that emerges into the entire complex of the inner life.
 Hence the use of the words "actualization" and "realization," which bring
 into the open the ontological backdrop underlying the noetic process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to grasp truth in this totalistic manner at any particular stage
 of spiritual development, the tenor of our inner being must be raised to
 a pitch where it is fit for the reception of some new disclosure of the
 truth.
 Wisdom and character, though not identical, are at any rate parallel terms,
 which in most cases mature in a delicately balanced ratio.
 We can grasp only what we are fit to grasp, and our fitness is largely
 a function of our character.
 The existential comprehension of truth thus becomes a matter of inward
 worth, of deservingness, or of merit.
 The way to effect this inward worthiness is by the performance of works
 of merit, not merely outwardly, but backed by the proper attitudes and
 disposition of mind.
 For the capacity to comprehend truths pertaining to the spiritual order
 is always proportional to the store and quality of accumulated merit.
 The greater and finer the merit, the larger and deeper the capacity for
 understanding.
 This principle holds at each level of maturation in the ascent towards
 full realization, and applies with special force to the comprehension of
 ultimate truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimate truth, in the Buddha's Teaching, is Nibbana, the unconditioned
 element (asankhata dhatu), and realization of ultimate truth the realization
 of Nibbana.
 Nibbana is the perfection of purity: the destruction of all passions, the
 eradication of clinging, the abolition of every impulse towards self-affirmatio
n.
 The final thrust to the realization of Nibbana is the special province
 of wisdom, since wisdom alone is adequate to the task of comprehending
 all conditioned phenomena in their essential nature as impermanent, suffering
 and not-self, and of turning away from them to penetrate the unconditioned,
 where alone permanent freedom from suffering is to be found.
 But that this penetration may take place, our interior must be made commensurat
e in purity with the truth it would grasp, and this requires in the first
 instance that it be purged of all those elements obstructive to the florescence
 of a higher light and knowledge.
 The apprehension of Nibbana, this perfect purity secluded from the dust
 of passion, is only possible when a corresponding purity has been set up
 within ourselves.
 For only a pure mind can discern, through the dark mist of ignorance and
 defilement, the spotless purity of Nibbana, abiding in absolute solitude
 beyond the turmoil of the phenomenal procession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The achievement of such a purification of our inward being is the work of
 merit.
 Merit scours the mind of the coarser defilements, attenuates the grip of
 the unwholesome roots, and fortifies the productive power of the wholesome,
 beneficial states.
 Through its cumulative force it provides the foundation for wisdom's final
 breakthrough to the unconditioned.
 It is the fuel, so to speak, for the ascent of wisdom from the mundane
 to the supramundane.
 Just as the initial stages of a lunar rocket work up the momentum that
 enables the uppermost stage to break the gravitational pull of the earth
 and reach the moon, so does merit give to the spiritual life that forward
 thrust that will propel the wisdom-faculty past the gravitational pull
 of the mundane order and permit it to penetrate the transcendental truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classical Buddhist commentators underscore this preparatory purgative
 function of merit when they define merit (puñña) etymologically as "that
 which purges and purifies the mental continuum" (santanam punati visodheti).
 Merit performs its purgative function in the context of a complex process
 involving an agent and object of purification, and a mode of operation
 by which the purification takes place.
 The agent of purification is the mind itself, in its creative, formative
 role as the source and matrix of action.
 Deeds of merit are, as we have already seen, instances of wholesome kamma,
 and kamma ultimately reduces to volition.
 Therefore, at the fundamental level of analysis, a deed of merit consists
 in a volition, a determinative act of will belonging to the righteous order
 (puññabhisankhara).
 Since volition is a mode of mental activity, this means that merit turns
 out, under scrutiny, to be a mode of mental activity.
 It is, at the core of the behavior-pattern which serves as its vehicle,
 a particular application of thought by which the mind marshalls its components
 for the achievement of a chosen end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This discovery cautions us against misconstruing the Buddhist stress on
 the practice of merit as a call for blind subjection to rules and rites.
 The primary instrument behind any act of merit, from the Buddhist point
 of view, is the mind.
 The deed itself in its physical or vocal dimension serves mainly as an
 expression of a corresponding state of consciousness, and without a keen
 awareness of the nature and significance of the meritorious deed, the bare
 outward act is devoid of purgative value.
 Even when rules of conduct are observed, or rituals and worship performed
 with a view to the acquisition of merit, the spiritual potency of these
 structures derives not from any intrinsic sanctity they might possess in
 themselves, but from their effectiveness in channelizing the current of
 mental activity in a spiritual beneficial direction.
 They function, in effect, as skillful means or expedient devices for inducing
 wholesome states of consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mechanical conformity to moral rules, or the performance of religious duties
 through unquestioning obedience to established forms, far from serving
 as a means to salvation, in the Buddhist outlook actually constitute obstacles.
 They are instances of "clinging to rules and rituals" (silabbataparamasa),
 the third of the fetters (samyojana) binding beings to the wheel of becoming,
 which must be abandoned in order to enter upon the path to final deliverance.
 Even in such relatively external forms of merit-making as the undertaking
 of moral precepts and ceremonial worship, mindfulness and clear comprehension
 are essential; much more, then, are they necessary to the predominantly
 internal modes of meritorious activity, such as meditation or the study
 of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The object of the purifying process of merit is again the mind, only here
 considered not from the standpoint of its immediacy, as a creative source
 of action, but from the standpoint of its duration, as a continuum (cittasantan
a).
 For, looked at from the temporal point of view, the mind is no stable entity
 enduring self-identical through its changing activities; it is, rather,
 a serial continuity composed of discrete acts of mentation bound to one
 another by exact laws of causal interconnection.
 Each thought-unit flashes into being, persists for an extremely brief moment,
 and then perishes, passing on to its immediate successor its storage of
 recorded impressions.
 Each individual member of the series inherits, preserves and transmits,
 along with its own novel modifications, the entire content of the series
 as a whole, which thus underlies every one of its components.
 Thence the series maintains, despite its discontinuous composition, an
 element of uniformity that gives to the flow of separate thought-moments
 the character of a continuum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sequential current of mentation has been going on, according to Buddhism,
 without discernible beginning.
 Driven forward from life to life by ignorance and craving, it appears now
 in one mode of manifestation, now in another.
 Embedded in the mental continuum throughout its beginningless journey is
 a host of particularly afflictive and disruptive mental forces known as
 kilesas, "defilements." Foremost among them are the three unwholesome roots
 — greed, hatred and delusion; from this triad spring the remaining members
 of the set, such as pride, opinion, selfishness, envy, sloth and restlessness.
 During moments of passivity the defilements lie dormant at the base of
 the mental continuum, as anusaya or latent tendencies.
 But when, either through the impact of outer sensory stimuli or their own
 subliminal process of growth, they acquire sufficient force, they surge
 to the surface of consciousness in the form of obsessions (pariyutthana).
 The obsessions pollute the mind with their toxic flow and rebound upon
 the deeper levels of consciousness, reinforcing their roots at the base
 of the continuum.
 If they should gather still additional charge, the defilements may reach
 the even more dangerous stage of transgression (vitikkama), when they erupt
 as bodily or verbal actions that violate the fundamental laws of morality
 and lead to pain and suffering as their retributive consequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When merit is said to "purge and purify the mental continuum," it is so
 described in reference to its capacity to arrest the surging tide of the
 defilements which threatens to sweep the mind towards the perilous deep
 of transgressional action.
 Only wisdom — the supramundane wisdom of the noble paths — can eradicate
 the defilements at the level of latency, which is necessary if the bonds
 of existence are to be broken and deliverance attained.
 But the practice of merit can contribute much towards attenuating their
 obsessive force and establishing a foothold for wisdom to exercise its
 liberating function.
 Wisdom can operate only upon the base of a purified mind; the accumulation
 of merit purifies the mind; hence merit provides the supporting condition
 for wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind is allowed to flow according to its own momentum, without
 restraint or control, like a turbulent river it casts up to the surface
 — i.e., to the level of active consciousness — the store of pollutants it
 harbors at its base: lust, hatred, delusion, and their derivative defilements.
 If the defilements are then given further scope to grow by indulging them,
 they will wither the potential for good, darken the beam of awareness,
 and strangle the faculty of wisdom until it is reduced to a mere vestige.
 The performance of meritorious deeds serves as a means of resisting the
 upsurge of defiling states, of replacing them with their wholesome opposites,
 and of thereby purifying the mental continuum to an extent sufficient to
 supply wisdom with the storage of strength it requires in the work of abolishin
g the defilements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effectiveness of merit in purifying the mental continuum stems from
 the concordance of a number of psychological laws.
 These laws, which can only be indicated briefly here, together function
 as the silent groundwork for the efficacy of the entire corpus of Buddhist
 spiritual practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first is the law that only one state of consciousness can occur at a
 time; though seemingly trivial, this law leads to important consequences
 when taken in conjunction with the rest.
 The second holds that states of consciousness with mutually opposed ethical
 qualities cannot coexist.
 The third stipulates that all the factors of consciousness — feeling, perceptio
n, volition and the remaining states included in the "aggregate of mental
 formations" — must partake of the same ethical quality as the consciousness
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A kammically active state of consciousness is either entirely wholesome,
 or entirely unwholesome; it cannot (by the second law) be both.
 Therefore, if a wholesome state is occurring, no unwholesome state can
 simultaneously occur.
 A wholesome, spiritually beneficial state of consciousness necessarily
 shuts out every unwholesome, detrimental state, as well as (by the third
 law) all unwholesome concomitant factors of consciousness.
 So at the moment one is performing an act of merit, the consciousness and
 volition behind that meritorious deed will automatically preclude an unwholesom
e consciousness, volition, and the associated defilements.
 At that moment, at least, the consciousness will be pure.
 And the frequent performance of meritorious acts will, on every occasion,
 bar out the opportunity for the defilements to arise at the time of their
 performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the performance of deeds of merit always induces a momentary purification,
 while the frequent performance of such deeds induces many occasions of
 momentary purification.
 But that some more durable result might be achieved an additional principle
 is necessary.
 This principle is supplied by the fourth law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth law holds that repetition confers strength.
 Just as the exercise of a particular muscle can transform that muscle from
 a frail, ineffectual strip of flesh into a dynamo of power and strength,
 so the repeated exercise of individual mental qualities can remodel them
 from sleeping soldiers into invincible warriors in the spiritual quest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repetition is the key to the entire process of self-transformation which
 constitutes the essence of the spiritual life.
 It is the very grounding that makes self-transformation possible.
 By force of repetition the fragile, tender shoots of the pure and wholesome
 qualities — faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom — can
 blossom into sovereign faculties (indriya) in the struggle for enlightenment,
 or into indomitable powers (bala) in the battle against the defilements.
 By repeated resistance to the upsurge of evil and repeated application
 to the cultivation of the good, the demon can become a god and the criminal
 a saint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If repetition provides the key to self-transformation, then volition provides
 the instrument through which repetition works.
 Volition acts as a vector force upon the mental continuum out of which
 it emerges, reorienting the continuum according to its own moral tone.
 Each act of will recedes with its passing into the onward rushing current
 of mentation and drives the current in its own direction.
 Wholesome volitions direct the continuum towards the good — towards purity,
 wisdom and ultimate liberation; unwholesome volitions drive it towards
 the evil — towards defilement, ignorance and inevitable bondage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every occasion of volition modifies the mental life in some way and to some
 degree, however slight, so that the overall character of an individual
 at any one time stands as a reflex and revelation of the volitions accumulated
 in the continuum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the will propels the entire current of mental life in its own direction,
 it is the will which must be strengthened by force of repetition.
 The restructuring of mental life can only take place through the reformation
 of the will by leading it unto wholesome channels.
 The effective channel for re-orientation of the will is the practice of
 merit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the will is directed towards the cultivation of merit, it will spontaneousl
y hamper the stream of defilements and bolster the company of noble qualities
 in the storage of the continuum.
 Under its gentle tutelage the factors of purity will awaken from their
 dormant condition and take their place as regular propensities in the personali
ty.
 A will devoted to the practice of charity will generate kindness and compassion
; a will devoted to the observance of the precepts will generate harmlessness,
 honesty, restraint, truthfulness and sobriety; a will devoted to mental
 culture will generate calm and insight.
 Faith, reverence, humility, sympathy, courage and equanimity will come
 to growth.
 Consciousness will gain in tranquillity, buoyancy, pliancy, agility and
 proficiency.
 And a consciousness made pure by these factors will advance without hindrance
 through the higher attainments in meditation and wisdom to the realization
 of Nibbana, the consummation of spiritual endeavor.

The Path of Understanding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prince Siddhattha renounced the life of the palace and entered the forest
 as a hermit seeking a solution to the problem of suffering.
 Six years after entering he came out a Buddha, ready to show others the
 path he had found so that they too could work out their deliverance.
 It was the experience of being bound to the perishable and unsatisfying
 that gave the impetus to the Buddha's original quest, and it was the certainty
 of having found the unperishing and perfectly complete that inspired the
 execution of his mission.
 Thence the Buddha could sum up his Teaching in the single phrase: "I teach
 only suffering and the cessation of suffering." But though the Buddha's
 Teaching might be simple in its statement, the meaning behind the verbal
 formulation is profound and precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha envisages suffering in its full range and essence rather than
 in its mere manifest forms.
 It is not just physical or mental pain that he means by suffering, but
 the recurrent revolution of the wheel of becoming, with its spokes of birth,
 aging and death.
 Taking our immersion in a condition intrinsically inadequate as the starting
 point of his doctrine, he devotes the remainder to showing the way out
 of this condition.
 The solution the Buddha offers to the problem of suffering draws its cogency
 from the strict logic of causality.
 Suffering is neither an accident nor an imposition from without, but a
 contingent phenomenon arising through the force of conditions.
 It hangs upon a specific set of supports, and is therefore susceptible
 to treatment by tackling the genetic structure which maintains it in being.
 By removing the conditions out of which it arises, it is possible to bring
 the whole phenomenon of suffering to an end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to reach the state of emancipation, it is of the first importance
 that the causal chain which originates suffering be snapped in the right
 place.
 Any proposed solution which does not remedy the problem of suffering at
 its source will eventually prove to be only a palliative, not a final cure.
 That the chain be broken in the right place requires an accurate determination
 of the interconnection of its links.
 The chain must be traced back to its most fundamental factor and cut off
 at that very point.
 Then suffering will no longer be able to arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the Buddha's Teaching, the primary link in the sequence of
 conditions generating suffering is ignorance (avijja).
 Ignorance is a primordial blindness to the true nature of phenomena; it
 is a lack of understanding of things as they really are.
 It functions as a mental obscuration cloaking our normal process of cognition
 and permeating our thought patterns with distortion and error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the various misconceptions produced by ignorance, the most basic is
 the apprehension of phenomena through the category of substantial existence.
 Phenomena are not isolated units locked up in themselves, but participants
 in an interconnected field of events.
 Their being derives from the entire system of relata to which they belong,
 not from some immutable core of identity intrinsic to themselves.
 Thence they are devoid of an abiding essence; their mode of being is insubstant
ial, relational and interdependent.
 However, under the influence of ignorance, this essenceless nature of phenomena
 is not understood.
 It is blotted out by the basic unawareness, and as a consequence, phenomena
 present themselves to cognition in a mode different from their actual mode
 of being.
 They appear substantial, self-subsistent, and exclusivistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sphere where this illusion is most immediately felt is the sphere where
 it is most accessible to us — namely, our own experience.
 The experiential domain is reflectively divisible into two sectors — a
 cognizing or subjective sector made up of consciousness and its adjuncts,
 and a cognized or objective sector made up of the cognitive data.
 Though the two sectors are interlocking and mutually dependent, through
 the operation of ignorance they are conceptually bifurcated and reduced
 to an adventitious subject-object confrontation.
 On the one side the cognizing sector is split off from the experiential
 complex and conceived as a subject distinct from the cognitive act itself;
 the objective sector in turn congeals into a world of external things pointing
 to the subject as its field of action and concern.
 Consciousness awakens to itself as a persisting ego standing up against
 the world as an "other" perpetually estranged from itself.
 Thence it commences its long career of conquest, control and domination
 in order to justify its own suspect claim to a self-subsistent mode of
 being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This cognitive error with its consequent solidification of the ego is the
 source of the afflictions (kilesa) which hold us in subjection to suffering.
 The lurking suspicion that the mode of being we credit to ourselves may
 be unfounded arouses an inner disquietude, a chronic anxiety compelling
 a drive to fortify the sense of egoity and give it solid ground on which
 to stand.
 We need to establish our existence to ourselves, to give inner confirmation
 to our conception of personal substantiality, and this need occasions the
 ordering of the psychic life around the focal point of ego.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bid for self-confirmation makes its impact felt on both the emotional
 and intellectual fronts.
 The dominion of the ego in the emotional sphere appears most conspicuously
 in the weight of the unwholesome roots — greed, hatred and delusion — as
 determinants of conduct.
 Because the ego is essentially a vacuum, the illusion of egohood generates
 a nagging sense of insufficiency.
 We feel oppressed by an aching incompleteness, an inner lack requiring
 constantly to be filled.
 The result is greed, a relentless drive to reach out and devour whatever
 we can — of pleasure, wealth, power and fame — in a never successful attempt
 to bring the discomfort fully to an end.
 When our drive to satisfaction meets with frustration we react with hatred,
 the urge to destroy the obstacle between our desire and its satisfaction.
 If the obstructions to our satisfaction prove too powerful for the tactics
 of aggression, a third strategy will be used: dullness or delusion, an
 attitude of deliberate unawareness adopted as a shell to hide our vulnerability
 to pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the intellectual front the ego-illusion engenders a move by reason to
 establish on logical grounds the existence of a substantial self.
 The idea "I am" is a spontaneous notion born of ignorance, the basic unawarenes
s of the egoless nature of phenomena.
 By accepting this idea at its face value, as pointing to a real "I," and
 by attempting to fill in the reference, we develop a "view of self," a
 belief confirming the existence of a self and giving it an identity in
 the framework of our psycho-physical constitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theories which emerge invariably fall into one or another of the two
 metaphysical extremes — either eternalism when we assume the self to enjoy
 eternal existence after death, or annihilationism, when we assume the self
 to be extinguished at death.
 Neither doctrine can be established on absolutely compelling grounds, for
 both are rounded on a common error: the assumption of a self as an enduring,
 substantial entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the pivot of our cognitive adherences and their emotional ramifications
 is the notion of an ego, a powerful current of psychic energy comes to
 be invested in our interpretive schemes.
 And because the notion of an ego is in actuality groundless, the product
 of a fundamental misconception, this investment of energy brings only disappoin
tment in the end.
 We cling to things in the hope that they will be permanent, satisfying
 and substantial, and they turn out to be impermanent, unsatisfying and
 insubstantial.
 We seek to impose our will upon the order of events, and we find that events
 obey a law of their own, insubordinate to our urge towards control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of our clinging is eventual suffering.
 Yet this suffering which arises from the breakdown of our egocentric attempts
 at dominance and manipulation is not entirely negative in value.
 It contains a tremendous positive value, a vast potential, for by shattering
 our presumptions it serves to awaken our basic intelligence and set us
 on the quest for liberation.
 It forces us to discover the ultimate futility of our drive to structure
 the world from the standpoint of the ego, and makes us recognize the need
 to acquire a new perspective free from the compulsive patterns which keep
 us tied to suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the most fundamental factor in the bondage of the ego is ignorance,
 to reach this new perspective ignorance must be eliminated.
 To eliminate ignorance it is not sufficient merely to observe rules of
 conduct, to generate faith, devotion and virtue, or even to develop a calm
 and concentrated mind.
 All these are requisites to be sure, essential and powerful aids along
 the path, but even in unison they are not enough.
 Something more is required, some other element that alone can ensure the
 complete severing of the conditional nexus sustaining the round of samsaric
 suffering.
 That something more is understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path to liberation is essentially a path of understanding.
 Its core is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are: "It
 is for one who knows and sees that the destruction of the defilements takes
 place, not for one who does not know and does not see." The objective domain
 where understanding is to be aroused is our own experience.
 Since our distorted interpretations of our experience provide the food
 which nourishes the process of ego, it is here, in experience, that the
 ego-illusion must be dispelled.
 Our own experience is, of all things, that which is "closest to ourselves,"
 for it is through this that everything else is registered and known.
 And yet, though so close, our own experience is at the same time shrouded
 in darkness, its true characteristics hidden from our awareness by the
 screen of ignorance.
 The Buddha's Teaching is the key which helps us to correct our understanding,
 enabling us to see things as they are.
 It is the light which dispels the darkness of ignorance, so that we can
 understand our own understanding of things "just as a man with eyes might
 see forms illuminated by a lamp."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correct understanding of experience takes place in the context of meditation.
 It requires the development of insight (vipassana) based on a foundation
 of meditative calm (samatha).
 No amount of merely intellectual knowledge can replace the need for personal
 realization.
 Because our tendency to misconceive phenomena persists through a blindness
 to their true nature, only the elimination of this blindness through direct
 vision can rectify our erroneous patterns of cognition.
 The practice of Buddhist meditation is not a way of dissolving our sense
 of individual identity in some undifferentiated absolute or of withdrawing
 into the bliss of a self-contained interiority.
 It is, rather, a way of understanding the nature of things through the
 portal where that nature is most accessible to ourselves, namely, our own
 processes of body and of mind.
 The practice of meditation has profound effects upon our sense of identity;
 the alterations it produces, however, do not come about by subordinating
 the intelligence to some uncritically accepted generalization, but through
 a detached, sober and exhaustive scrutiny of the experiential field that
 provides the locus for our sense of identity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The focal method of the practice of meditation is reflective awareness,
 a bending back of the beam of awareness upon itself in order to illuminate
 the true characteristics of existence implicated in each occasion of cognition.
 The path of understanding unfolds in three successive stages called "the
 three full understandings." In the first stage, the "full understanding
 of the known" (natapariñña), the domain of experience is broken down by
 meditative analysis into its constituting factors, which are then carefully
 defined in terms of their salient qualities and functions.
 The categories employed in this operation are the key terms in the Buddhist
 analysis of personality — the aggregates (khandha), sense bases (ayatana),
 and elements (dhatu).
 The purpose of this dissection is to dispel the illusion of substantiality
 that hovers over our gross perception of our experience.
 By revealing that what common sense takes to be a solid monolithic whole
 is in reality a conglomeration of discrete factors, the contemplation deprives
 the sense of self-identification of its chief support, the notion of the
 ego as a simple unity.
 The factors which emerge from this analytical investigation are then correlated
 with their causes and conditions, disclosing their contingency and lack
 of independence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second stage of understanding is the "full understanding of scrutinization"
 (tiranapariñña).
 At this stage the experiential field is examined, not as before in terms
 of its individuating features, but by way of its universal marks.
 These universal marks are three: impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha)
 and non-self (anatta).
 Under the limitations of ordinary cognition, phenomena are apprehended
 as permanent, pleasurable and self.
 In the contemplative situation these assumptions must be corrected, replaced
 by the perception of phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable and non-self.
 The task of the meditative process, at this level, is to ascribe these
 qualities to the material and mental processes, and to attempt to view
 all phenomena in their light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the second stage is fully mature, it gives way gradually to the third
 type of comprehension, the "full understanding of abandonment" (pahanapariñña).
 Here the momentary insights achieved at the previous level blossom into
 full penetrations.
 Impermanence, suffering and selflessness are no longer merely understood
 as qualities of phenomena, but are seen with complete clarity as the nature
 of phenomena themselves.
 These realizations bring about the final abandonment of the deluded perceptions
 as well as the destruction of the ego-tainted emotions which cluster around
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To walk the path of understanding is to begin to see through the deceptions
 which have held our imaginations captive through the long stretch of beginningl
ess time.
 It is to outgrow our passions and prejudices, and to cast off the mask
 of false identities we are accustomed to assume, the vast array of identities
 that constitute our wandering in samsaric existence.
 The path is not an easy one, but calls for great effort and personal integrity.
 Its reward lies in the happiness of growing freedom which accompanies each
 courageous step, and the ultimate emancipation which lies at the end.

\begin_layout Standard
On first encounter Buddhism confronts us as a paradox.
 Intellectually, it appears a freethinker's delight: sober, realistic, undogmati
c, almost scientific in its outlook and method.
 But if we come into contact with the living Dhamma from within, we soon
 discover that it has another side which seems the antithesis of all our
 rationalistic presuppositions.
 We still don't meet rigid creeds or random speculation, but we do come
 upon religious ideals of renunciation, contemplation and devotion; a body
 of doctrines dealing with matters transcending sense perception and thought;
 and — perhaps most disconcerting — a program of training in which faith
 figures as a cardinal virtue, doubt as a hindrance, barrier and fetter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we try to determine our own relationship with the Dhamma, eventually
 we find ourselves challenged to make sense out of its two seemingly irreconcila
ble faces: the empiricist face turned to the world, telling us to investigate
 and verify things for ourselves, and the religious face turned to the Beyond,
 advising us to dispel our doubts and place trust in the Teacher and his
 Teaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way we can resolve this dilemma is by accepting only one face of the
 Dhamma as authentic and rejecting the other as spurious or superfluous.
 Thus, with traditional Buddhist pietism, we can embrace the religious side
 of faith and devotion, but shy off from the hard-headed world-view and
 the task of critical inquiry; or, with modern Buddhist apologetics, we
 can extol the Dhamma's empiricism and resemblance to science, but stumble
 embarrassingly over the religious side.
 Yet reflection on what a genuine Buddhist spirituality truly requires,
 makes it clear that both faces of the Dhamma are equally authentic and
 that both must be taken into account.
 If we fail to do so, not only do we risk adopting a lopsided view of the
 teaching, but our own involvement with the Dhamma is likely to be hampered
 by partiality and conflicting attitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem remains, however, of bringing together the two faces of the
 Dhamma without sidling into self-contradiction.
 The key, we suggest, to achieving this reconciliation, and thus to securing
 the internal consistency of our own perspective and practice, lies in consideri
ng two fundamental points: first, the guiding purpose of the Dhamma; and
 second, the strategy it employs to achieve that purpose.
 The purpose is the attainment of deliverance from suffering.
 The Dhamma does not aim at providing us with factual information about
 the world, and thus, despite a compatibility with science, its goals and
 concerns are necessarily different from those of the latter.
 Primarily and essentially, the Dhamma is a path to spiritual emancipation,
 to liberation from the round of repeated birth, death and suffering.
 Offered to us as the irreplaceable means of deliverance, the Dhamma does
 not seek mere intellectual assent, but commands a response that is bound
 to be fully religious.
 It addresses us at the bedrock of our being, and there it awakens the faith,
 devotion and commitment appropriate when the final goal of our existence
 is at stake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But for Buddhism faith and devotion are only spurs which impel us to enter
 and persevere along the path; by themselves they cannot ensure deliverance.
 The primary cause of bondage and suffering, the Buddha teaches, is ignorance
 regarding the true nature of existence; hence in the Buddhist strategy
 of liberation the primary instrument must be wisdom, the knowledge and
 vision of things as they really are.
 Investigation and critical inquiry, cool and uncommitted, constitute the
 first step toward wisdom, enabling us to resolve our doubts and gain a
 conceptual grasp of the truths upon which our deliverance depends.
 But doubt and questioning cannot continue indefinitely.
 Once we have decided that the Dhamma is to be our vehicle to spiritual
 freedom, we have to step on board: we must leave our hesitancy behind and
 enter the course of training which will lead us from faith to liberating
 vision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For those who approach the Dhamma in quest of intellectual or emotional
 gratification, inevitably it will show two faces, and one will always remain
 a puzzle.
 But if we are prepared to approach the Dhamma on its own terms, as the
 way to release from suffering, there will not be two faces at all.
 Instead we will see what was there from the start: the single face of Dhamma
 which, like any other face, presents two complementary sides.

Introduction: Is Unselfish Joy Practicable?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The virtue of mudita [muditaa],1 i.e., finding joy in the happiness and success
 of others, has not received sufficient attention either in expositions
 of Buddhist ethics, or in the meditative development of the four sublime
 states (brahma-vihara [brahma-vihaara]), of which mudita is one.
 It was, therefore, thought desirable to compile this little book of essays
 and texts and to mention in this introduction a few supplementary features
 of this rather neglected subject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been rightly stated that it is relatively easier for man to feel
 compassion or friendliness in situations which demand them, than to cherish
 a spontaneous feeling of shared joy, outside a narrow circle of one's family
 and friends.
 It mostly requires a deliberate effort to identify oneself with the joys
 and successes of others.
 Yet the capacity of doing so has psychological roots in man's nature which
 may be even deeper that his compassionate responses.
 There is firstly the fact that people do like to feel happy (with — or
 without — good reason) and would prefer it to the shared sadness of compassion.
 Man's gregarious nature (his "sociability") already gives him some familiarity
 with shared emotions and shared pleasure, though mostly on a much lower
 level than that of our present concern.
 There is also in man (and in some animals) not only an aggressive impulse,
 but also a natural bent towards mutual aid and co-operative action.
 Furthermore, there is the fact that happiness is infectious and an unselfish
 joy can easily grow out of it.
 Children readily respond by their own smiles and happy mood to smiling
 faces and happiness around them.
 Though children can be quite jealous and envious at times, they also can
 visibly enjoy it when they have made a playmate happy by a little gift
 and they are then quite pleased with themselves.
 Let parents and educators wisely encourage this potential in the child.
 Then this seed will quite naturally grow into a strong plant in the adolescent
 and the adult, maturing from impulsive and simple manifestations into the
 sublime state of unselfish joy (mudita-brahmavihara).
 Thus, here too, the child may become "the father of a man." Such education
 towards joy with others should, of course, not be given in a dry didactic
 manner, but chiefly in a practical way by gently making the child observe,
 appreciate, and enjoy the happiness and success of others, and by trying
 himself to create a little joy in others.
 This can be aided by acquainting the child with examples of selfless lives
 and actions for his joyful admiration of them (and these, of course, should
 not be limited to Buddhist history).
 This feature should not be absent in Buddhist youth literature and schoolbooks,
 throughout all age groups.
 And this theme should be continued in Buddhist magazines and literature
 for adults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Admittedly, the negative impulses in man, like aggression, envy, jealousy,
 etc., are much more in evidence than his positive tendencies towards communal
 service, mutual aid, unselfish joy, generous appreciation of the good qualities
 of his fellow-men, etc.
 Yet, as all these positive features are definitely found in man (though
 rarely developed), it is quite realistic to appeal to them, and activate
 and develop that potential by whatever means we can, in our personal relationsh
ips, in education, etc.
 "If it were impossible to cultivate the Good, I would not tell you to do
 so," said the Buddha.
 This is, indeed, a positive, optimistic assurance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this potential for unselfish joy is widely and methodically encouraged
 and developed, starting with the Buddhist child (or, for that matter, with
 any child) and continued with adults (individuals and Buddhist groups,
 including the Sangha), the seed of mudita can grow into a strong plant
 which will blossom forth and find fruition in many other virtues, as a
 kind of beneficial "chain reaction": magnanimity, tolerance, generosity
 (of both heart and purse), friendliness, and compassion.
 When unselfish joy grows, many noxious weeds in the human heart will die
 a natural death (or will, at least, shrink): jealousy and envy, ill will
 in various degrees and manifestations, cold-heartedness, miserliness (also
 in one's concern for others), and so forth.
 Unselfish joy can, indeed, act as a powerful agent in releasing dormant
 forces of the Good in the human heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know very well how envy and jealousy (the chief opponents of unselfish
 joy) can poison a man's character as well as the social relationships on
 many levels of his life.
 They can paralyze the productivity of society, on governmental, professional,
 industrial, and commercial levels.
 Should not, therefore, all effort be made to cultivate their antidote,
 that is mudita?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mudita will also vitalize and ennoble charitable and social work.
 While compassion (karuna [karu.naa]) is, or should be, the inspiration for
 it, unselfish joy should be its boon companion.
 Mudita will prevent compassionate action from being marred by a condescending
 and patronizing attitude which often repels or hurts the recipient.
 Also, when active compassion and unselfish joy go together, it will be
 less likely that works of service turn into dead routine performed indifferentl
y.
 Indifference, listlessness, boredom (all nuances of the Pali term arati)
 are said to be the 'distant enemies' of mudita.
 They can be vanquished by an alliance of compassion and unselfish joy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In him who gives and helps, the joy he finds in such action will enhance
 the blessings imparted by these wholesome deeds: unselfishness will become
 more and more natural to him, and such ethical unselfishness will help
 him towards a better appreciation and the final realization of the Buddha's
 central doctrine of No-self (anatta [anattaa]).
 He will also find it confirmed that he who is joyful in his heart will
 gain easier the serenity of a concentrated mind.
 These are, indeed, great blessings which the cultivation of joy with others'
 happiness can bestow!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays, moral exhortations fall increasingly on deaf ears, whether they
 are motivated theologically or otherwise.
 Preaching morals with an admonishing finger is now widely resented and
 rejected.
 This fact worries greatly the churches and educators in the West.
 But there are ample indications that this may, more or less, happen also
 in the Buddhist countries of the East where ethics is still taught and
 preached in the old hortatory style and mostly in a rather stereotype and
 unimaginative way, with little reference to present-day moral and social
 problems.
 Hence modern youth will increasingly feel that such "moralizings" are not
 their concern.
 In fact within the frame of the Buddhist teachings which do not rely on
 the authoritarian commandments of God and church, but on man's innate capacity
 for self-purification, such conventionalized presentation of ethics which
 chiefly relies on over-worked scriptural references, must appear quite
 incongruous and will prove increasingly ineffective for young and old alike.
 The need for reform in this field is urgent and of vital importance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was also with this situation in view, that the preceding observations
 have stressed the fact that a virtue like unselfish and altruistic joy
 has its natural roots in the human heart and can be of immediate benefit
 to the individual and society.
 In other words, the approach to a modern presentation of Buddhist ethics
 should be pragmatic and contemporary, enlivened by a genuine and warm-hearted
 human concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this troubled world of ours, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughts
 and deeds of compassion; but there seem to be all too few for sharing in
 others' joy.
 Hence it is necessary for us to create new opportunities for unselfish
 joy, by the active practice of loving-kindness (metta [mettaa]) and compassion
 (karuna), in deeds, words, and meditative thought.
 Yet, in a world that can never be without disappointments and failures,
 we must also arm ourselves with the equanimity (upekkha [upekkhaa]) to
 protect us from discouragement and feelings of frustration, should we encounter
 difficulties in our efforts to expand the realm of unselfish joy.

Unselfish Joy: A Neglected Virtue

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
(From Metta, The Journal of the Buddhist Federation of Australia, Vol.
 12, No.
 2.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mudita — unselfish or sympathetic joy — is one of the most neglected topics
 within the whole range of the Buddha Dhamma, probably because of its subtlety
 and of the wealth of nuances latent within it.
 Besides getting honorable mention within the context of The Four Divine
 Abidings (brahma-vihara), few commentators have had much more to say about
 it apart from explaining that it means "sympathetic joy at the good fortune
 or success of others." Only one notable writer, Conze (in Buddhist Thought
 in India), has had the insight to suggest that mudita, i.e.
 sympathy, is a pre-requisite of metta (loving-kindness) and of karuna (compassi
on).
 He thus names appreciation as one of the components of mudita.
 How right he is! For one cannot appreciate another person without seeing
 some good in him.
 If one does not appreciate the other person in the slightest degree, one
 would be hard put to experience joy at any stroke of good fortune or success
 that may befall him.
 To stimulate feelings of pleasure when, in fact, one feels none, would
 be the grossest of hypocrisy.
 Thus, mudita tacitly implies looking for the good in others and learning
 to recognize and admire what good there is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Likewise, if one has a misanthropic view of mankind, regarding people as
 essentially evil and not worth being concerned about, one cannot, on the
 face of it, make much headway with any of The Four Divine Abidings.
 To have a sympathetic attitude towards human beings does not betoken an
 idealization of man, but rather a realistic appraisal: that, though often
 in error and grievously at fault, man has, nevertheless, the potential
 to rise above his darkness and ignorance into the light of knowledge and
 even to undreamed of heights of Nirvana.
 Unless one has that measure of faith and confidence in mankind which the
 Buddha himself had, the practice of metta and karuna is impossible.
 Thus, the broadest and most simple aspect of mudita as sympathy towards
 mankind, is also the most basic and important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To regard mudita as being relevant only on certain relatively rare occasions
 when our friends and acquaintances come into a bonanza of some kind, is
 to fragment it and render it trivial, thereby missing the essential matrix.
 It should not be regarded as a matter of turning on a tap from which mudita
 will gush forth.
 There should be, in a certain sense, a quiet stream of sympathy and understandi
ng flowing within the individual all the time.
 Though, to be sure, it does also mean developing the capacity to participate
 in another person's finest hour and doing so spontaneously and sincerely.
 It is indeed a depressing fact that people are much more ready to sympathize
 with the misfortunes of others than to rejoice with them, a psychological
 quirk in people which wrung from Montaigne the ironic statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is something altogether not too displeasing in the misfortunes of
 our friends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning back to the essential matrix of mudita as sympathy towards mankind,
 faith in its potential for good and acceptance of its worthwhileness, this
 is precisely what is lacking in the world today.
 There is abroad a kind of cosmic gloom and, among some large sections of
 people, a feeling of defeatism.
 Probably the scene is largely colored by the shadow of the hydrogen bomb
 and the various other horrible weapons of destruction which we know the
 nations are so busy in manufacturing.
 All in all, too much has happened in too short a time.
 More scientific and technological discoveries have been telescoped into
 the last fifty (or is it thirty?) years than in the previous five hundred,
 and the total result is, at the moment, of dubious benefit to humanity
 as a whole, though of inestimable worth to the new millionaires who have
 managed to muscle in on the expanding economy.
 Electric and nuclear power, the spectacular forging ahead of communication,
 transport and industry have brought in their wake such negative by-products
 as over-population, more and more urbanization into colossal, concentrated
 centers, such as Tokyo, New York, and London (and even Sydney and Melbourne),
 which, in turn, has given rise to other unfortunate results, both physical,
 and psychological: pollution from industrial waste, destruction of natural
 resources; individual de-socialization, alienation, stress, as evidenced
 by the delinquency figures, the drift to drugs, character disorders, feelings
 of the meaninglessness of life, rise in crime, wanton destructiveness (a
 sure symptom of frustration and an unlived life), despair, suicide.
 We know that such ills have always existed in society, and that probably

 As it is, man feels more insecure than ever, more uncertain and lost.
 Viewing these symptoms, many people throughout the world have drawn the

 Such a view has always been characteristic of old age.

 in mass murder.

So, let us lay to rest forever the belief that in the past men were truer,
 kinder, more upright, and generally more worthy than they are today.
 Let us give that piece of romantic fiction the respectable funeral that
 it deserves.
 Our ancestors and predecessors were no better than we are, and we are certainly
 not worse than they were.
 In many respects we have improved considerably on the ways of our forbears.
 Actually, there has been a great deal of progress, considering that slavery
 hung on in England until 1772, in America till 1863, and serfdom in Russia
 till 1861.
 And, in spite of the injustices and lack of moral scruples that still exist,
 there is more awareness, kindliness, and sensitivity in many human societies
 than there has ever been before.
 Today when a national disaster of great magnitude occurs in a country,
 quite often the rest of the world rallies around and helps — perhaps not
 to the extent that it should, but nonetheless, to some extent.
 Such a broadening expansion of the human conscience would have been deemed
 a Utopian ideal in former times and impossible.

However, in the past, without exception, whatever was inflicted upon a people,
 they mostly took.
 Today they don't — they protest, they demonstrate, they kick up a fuss.
 They have become articulate because they have realized that the greatest
 evil of all is not poverty, racialism, or war but powerlessness.
 Naturally, such an unexpected show of interest in public affairs is embarrassin

 is some wistful talk by diehards of "the silent majority," but the present
 indications are that "the silent majority" is likely to become a silent
 minority in the face of such urgent problems as over-population, and destructio

 However, against this general tendency is the lamentable fact that nothing

So, far from feeling dejected and dispirited about mankind, we should be
 hopeful and buoyant.
 There would be infinitely more cause for alarm and despair if people were

 The arguing and the restlessness throughout the world is about the principles
 on which we should run our lives, a struggle for values other than the
 profit motive, for ways and means to make possible greater co-operation
 between individuals and nations, and for moral maturity in coping with
 man's new powers and responsibilities.
 People discuss, argue, petition, protest, demonstrate because of their
 sympathy, compassion, and love for mankind.
 It is very difficult to differentiate between the three or to recognize
 precisely the line of demarcation where one ends and the other begins,
 because they are illimitable.
 There are, of course, others who see in these conflicts only hatred but
 this view is hardly tenable because it is much easier and much more comfortable
 to remain uninvolved, drifting with the current, nor swimming against it.

A feature of the Buddha-Dhamma is cognizance of the pairs of opposites in
 the training to get beyond them.
 The Buddha's method of mental training and development was to teach by
 first defining unwholesome or unskillful thoughts, words, and deeds, or
 practices which characterize many of man's proclivities, and then to propound
 their opposites of a wholesome or skillful nature as an achievement to
 be sought after for the abolition of them both, eventually, when even the
 good must be left behind as well as the evil; when even the Raft of Dhamma
 is to be abandoned — after crossing the flood of samsara.
 The trouble with so many of the unwise is their desire to abandon the Raft
 of Dhamma before reaching the further shore.
 The Buddha's method of expounding the negative and the positive, the passive,
 and the dynamic aspects of behavior, in both abstract and concrete terms,
 is obviously to create awareness of what is to be sought after and nurtured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic ignorance featured in Buddhism is not so much a rejection of the
 truth as it is a failure to perceive it.
 It is, as it were, a "blind spot" in our perception akin to the physical
 damage of a section of the brain or the nervous system which results in
 impaired vision or locomotion.
 In other words, the depth of our ignorance may be measured by our lack
 of consciousness of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why it is so necessary that we should see and recognize our failings
 and shortcomings if we are to eradicate them.
 It is also important that we should be mindful of "the good that has arisen,"
 and to foster and develop it to the point of perfection.
 To realize our imperfections is the beginning of wisdom — the first light
 to shine on the darkness of our ignorance.
 While we are blissfully unaware of unwholesome states of mind within ourselves,
 such states will continue to flourish, and their roots will dig deeper
 into our very being.
 Just so too, in our relationships with our fellow men, the unperceived
 evils will be repeated unconsciously and unrecognized, building up a cumulative
 unhappy future for us under the retributive causal law of karma.

In dealing with mudita or altruistic joy, we are once more to some extent
 frustrated with the inadequacy of translations for "brahma-vihara" or "appamaññ
a" [appama~n~na] — the former as "sublime or divine abode," and the latter
 as "boundless state." To reduce either of these terms to modern idiom is
 difficult.
 The four characteristics grouped under these terms are: loving-kindness,
 compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity, extended to universal application.
 In their perfection they are "sublime" and "boundless," and to be "dwelt
 in" as one speaks of "dwelling in Peace," so we will leave it at that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with all perfections, these four desirable characteristics are the antidotes
 to the poisons of their opposite imperfections, and here is where the recogniti
on of their opposites is apposite.
 Less has been said or written of mudita than of the other three of these
 four characteristics, perhaps, again, because of its somewhat clumsy translatio
n.
 While loving-kindness and compassion are objective, reaching out to all
 sentient beings, mudita and equanimity are subjective, or personal in their
 application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may seem strange at first, until we critically examine the source, to
 speak of either selfish or unselfish joy.
 Joy is an emotional ecstasy arising from pleasure.
 It is something intensely personal.
 While we can and do share our pleasures to some extent with others, the
 resultant impact of them on various personalities will vary as widely as
 the personalities.
 At times what may give rise to rapturous joy in us, when shared, may give
 rise to positive aversion in another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A pertinent example of this would be the reactionary effect of certain music
 on people of differing tastes.
 While it is not uncommon for some of the modern generation to literally
 swoon in ecstasy under the influence of the combination of discordant and
 dissonant notes and chords, others find them anything but entertaining
 or pleasurable.
 Here we have what might be termed "selfish joy" on the part of the participants
, by those who have to suffer most unwilling participation.
 For all that, within the group enjoying it, there is a reciprocity of delight,
 happiness, and rapture between the entertainers and the entertained.
 Superficially, then, we could say it is not the phenomenon of joy itself,
 that is either selfish or altruistic by nature, but that time, place, and
 circumstance must all be considered in relation one to the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, to bring mudita within the ambit of the Buddha-Dhamma we need to
 go deeper into the necessity for cultivating this perfection.
 What are the opposites to be eliminated by its cultivation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We never tire of asserting the interdependence of every aspect of the Buddha-Dha
mma, no matter which particular facet is being discussed.
 We have already stated that ignorance is failure of perception, and it
 is true that greed and hatred do arise through the non-perception of their
 source and subsequent results; that basically craving born of ignorance
 is the culprit, and that the purpose of the Buddha-Dhamma is to eliminate
 craving.
 It is craving that gives rise to jealousy, envy, covetousness, avarice,
 and greed in all of its manifestations.
 Here it is that mudita when practiced and developed becomes a "sublime"
 and "boundless" state of mind to be "dwelt in" as a corrective characteristic
 for their removal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most frequently used similes by the Buddha was that of fire.
 At times it was the destructive quality of fire that was likened to the
 destructive nature of the passions.
 At other times it was the ardent nature of fire that was to be emulated
 in the pursuance of the path to holiness.
 In its uncontrolled existence fire is a destructive danger.
 Under control it is one of man's greatest boons and blessings.
 In either case it was a motivating force to be reckoned with, at all times
 active, potent, and energetic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three roots of evil — greed, hatred, and delusion — are also known as
 "the three fires." On one occasion the Buddha and his band of monks were
 for the time staying on Gaya Head, a mountain near the city of Gaya.
 From their elevated position they watched one of the great fires that from
 time to time ravaged the countryside.
 This inspired what is known as "The Fire Sermon," which is the third recorded
 discourse delivered by the Buddha subsequent to his Enlightenment, and
 at the beginning of his long ministry.
 To the Buddha, the world of Samsara was like the flaming plains below,
 "Everything is burning," said the Buddha, "burning with the fire of passion,
 with the fired of hatred, with the fire of stupidity." (Vin.
 21)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is these three fires that give rise to jealousy, envy, covetousness,
 avarice, and greed.
 The craving for possessions, the craving for sensual pleasures, the begrudged
 success of others, the hatred that is begotten by the gains of others,
 the odious comparison of greater status compared with our humble circumstances,
 these are the "fires" that burn within us to our undoing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is now evident why mudita is such an important characteristic to be cultivate
d.
 When we can view the success of others with the same equanimity, and to
 the same extent, as we would extend metta and karuna — loving-kindness
 and compassion — to those who suffer grief and distress, sadness and tribulatio
n, sorrow and mourning, then we are beginning to exercise mudita, and are
 in the process of eradicating greed and craving.
 Developed still further, we can reach the stage of sharing with others
 their joy of possession, their financial or social successes, their elevation
 to positions of civic or national importance, or their receipt of titles
 and honorifics.
 In such a manner mudita is counteractive to conceits of all kinds, and
 its growth and development checks craving's grip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until we have developed this subjective characteristic within ourselves
 how can we develop the objective characteristics of metta and karuna? The
 accumulated possessions, results of our greed, may give us the pleasure
 and the happiness of the miser gloating over his hoard of gold.
 The happiness born of shared pleasures, shared love, shared possessions,
 shared delights in another's success, will surpass the meager selfish happiness
 of the miser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unselfish joy multiplies in ratio to the extension of its application, quite
 apart from its purifying effect on our own lives.

\begin_layout Standard
In Ñanamoli's translation of Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga he uses "gladness"
 for mudita, with the footnote: "Mudita — gladness — as one of the divine
 abidings is always used in the sense of gladness at others' success." Buddhaghos
a illustrates this by saying: "On seeing or hearing about a dear person
 being happy cheerful and glad, gladness can be aroused thus: 'This being
 is indeed glad.
 How good! How excellent!' Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and
 beloved person, so he pervades all being with gladness."

\begin_layout Standard
In "The Analysis of the Sixfold Sense-Field" (MN 137) the Buddha speaks
 of the six joys connected with renunciation.
 While such joys are subjective by nature, they are devoid of any taint
 of egoistic craving that could give rise to the cankers of jealousy, envy,
 covetousness, or greed.
 These joys arise on the realization of the impermanence of material shapes,
 sounds, smells, flavors, touches, and mental states, and the renunciation
 of attachment to them.

\begin_layout Standard
Altruistic joy is one of the four "sublime states" of mind — friendliness,
 compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity — which together form one related
 group among the various spiritual or physical exercises generally described
 as meditation or contemplation.
 These all have as their common aim the attainment of mental calm or equanimity,
 which is intended in turn to foster the development of liberating insight.
 "A still mind, like still water, yields a clear reflection of what is before
 it." This is why this particular series ends with equanimity, but the route
 by which it is attained in this case is different from that traversed for
 the most of the other themes used as a focus for concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The others, such as meditation on the breath, on death, on visual objects
 (kasina [kasi.na]), or on the Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Order of the
 Enlightened One, are entirely concerned with the self-cultivation of the
 meditator.
 Most of these themes are abstract or inanimate, while the Buddha and the
 Order (in the strict sense applicable here) have transcended any power
 of ours to help or hinder them.
 So the only person concerned or affected in these forms of training is
 the meditator.
 It was doubtless to encourage those wrestling by these means with their
 own inner weakness or conflicts that the following verse of the Dhammapada
 was uttered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let no one neglect his own task for the sake of another's however great;
 let him, after he has discerned his own task, devote himself to his task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if this were the whole story it would be difficult for such self-cultivation
 to serve in turn as a basis for the freedom from bondage to the self-concept,
 which is the main characteristic of the development of insight.
 Indeed, it was the recognition of the dangers of self-preoccupation, or
 self-righteousness, liable to arise in these often acute struggles for
 self-discipline, that impelled the more extreme exponents of the Pure Land
 school of Buddhism to abandon self-cultivation in favor of the less exacting
 path of reliance on the Buddha's transforming grace.
 But the cultivation of the "sublime states" represents a less radical form
 of compensation which, while compatible with other practices, can help
 to broaden the meditator's perspective in order to achieve a mode of equanimity
 which does not imply withdrawal into oneself or indifference to others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The starting point here, of course, is on the ethical plane in the practice
 of generosity in practical ways (dana; daana) which, in order to become
 interiorized and thereby go beyond mere outward form, must be grounded
 in an attitude of friendliness (metta) for all beings without distinction.
 Since this outlook implies the recognition that all beings are subject
 to joys and sorrows just as we are, it finds a natural development in sympathy
 — that is to say, compassion — for their sorrows and joy in their blessings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The former of these seems much the easier to achieve, since it is possible
 to feel compassion for suffering even in the absence of any positive friendline
ss for the sufferer, whereas it is only possible to share genuinely in another's
 joy if there is some element of true affection or friendliness present.
 This is perhaps why, on a much lower level of sensitivity, the reporting
 of news seems so heavily concentrated on the side of crimes and disasters,
 which are perhaps felt more likely to arouse interest than happier events
 and deeds.
 If the latter arouse any interest at all, it is likely to be spiced with
 envy or cynicism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only does genuine joy in the prosperity of others require some element
 of affection; it requires this to be of a quite high order.
 A great deal of what passes for love is really aimed at mere emotional
 gratification on the part of the lover, for whom the "beloved" is little
 more than a prop for acting out some drama satisfying a purely subjective
 need — the beloved's own needs being treated less seriously.
 Indeed, even apart from outright commercialization, a certain habit of
 bargaining with affections seems remarkably widespread, when one begins
 to take notice of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the light of this, the ability to feel a genuine joy in another's happiness,
 equal to one's satisfaction with one's own, represents a truly "sublime
 state." So it is not surprising that in the history of Buddhism, which cultivate
d this attitude systematically, there arose an aspiration to share with
 others not only one's material resources, but the spiritual resources described
 as merit.
 This aspiration follows naturally enough from the basic theory as to what
 merit is.
 Merit is the accumulation of tendencies resulting from enlightened deeds
 which, according to the law of moral causation (the law of karma), conduce
 to the future happiness of the doer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here he is joyful, hereafter he is joyful, in both worlds the well-doer
 is joyful.
 "I have done good" is the thought that make him happy.
 Still greater is his joy when he goes to states of bliss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the doer is still in a state where only purely personal forms of satisfaction
 are possible, the fruits of merit can only take this form.
 But suppose he loves even one being so much that, if that being is in some
 state of deprivation, he can only be made happy by the improvement of that
 being's lot, then the merit which is due to him can only take effect by
 benefiting him through that other's welfare.
 The wider his altruism expands, so that purely personal gratifications
 no longer adequately satisfy him, the wider must be the range of the benefit
 which his own merit would need to bring to others if it is to fulfill its
 defined function of bringing happiness to him.
 At the same time, his altruistic tendencies will ensure that he will have
 vastly more merit due to him, so his resources will tend to become commensurate
 with the aspirations, for example, of Santideva, when he says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
May I be an alleviator of the sorrows of all beings and a divine medicine
 to those afflicted by disease.
 May I be the benefactor and bringer of peace to them until all their bodily
 ailments and mental tribulations are at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of the sharing or transference of merit, so much stressed
 in Mahayana Buddhism (though not unknown in Theravadan practices) is sometimes
 objected to by Western Buddhists because of a superficial resemblance to
 the Christian doctrine of atonement, which they have rejected.
 But the principles entailed are not really identical, since the Christian
 doctrine is based on an essential distinction between the roles of the
 Creator and the created, while the Buddhist sharing of merit arises from
 a combination of the definition of merit and of the nature of altruistic
 joy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has a further importance too, in that it anticipates the emancipation
 to be derived from insight into the emptiness of the self-concept, that
 is to say, awakening to the emptiness of the concepts "I" and "mine" in
 terms of ultimate truth.
 On this level, the description "mine" as applied to merit will finally
 be seen to be as inapplicable as in the case of any other assumed possession.
 This was already explicitly set out in one of the Buddha's earliest discourses,
 "The Marks of the Not-self," in which he taught his first five disciples
 to contemplate each of the five components of personality in the terms:
 "This is not mine; this I am not; this is not my self." The fourth of these
 components is the aggregate of mental tendencies or activities, which include
 merit and demerit.
 Even on a lower plane than that of perfect insight, it can be seen that
 our deeds are not exclusively ours, because no one acts in absolute isolation,
 so that every act involves some stimulus or opportunity arising from activity
 of others.
 On the other hand, a too persistent insistence on the individual nature
 of merit can only impede the ultimate awakening to the Not-self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has some bearing, too, on the reason why friendliness, compassion,
 and altruistic joy are regarded as leading to an equanimity which does
 not imply an indifference to the joys and sorrows of others.
 In the absence of such a conclusion, the alternate sharing of joys and
 sorrows, like these emotions arising on one's own account, would be as
 endless as the world-cycles which it is the Buddhist aspiration to transcend.
 The goal of the "divine states" is that the aspirant, who in process achieves
 the role of a Bodhisattva in a two-way empathy with others by his perfect
 sharing of their joys and sorrows, is in a position to radiate to them
 stability, which in turn will help them to be less subject to their own
 emotional vicissitudes.
 In this way, he and they are liberated together, each sustaining the other.

The Meditative Development of Unselfish Joy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Buddhaghosa (fifth-century)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Excerpted from The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One who begins the development of unselfish joy should not start with dearly
 beloved person, a neutral person or hostile person.
 For it is not the mere fact that a person is dearly beloved, which makes
 him an immediate cause of developing unselfish joy, and still less so neutral
 or hostile person.
 Persons of the opposite sex and those who are dead are not suitable subjects
 for this meditation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very close friend, however, can be a suitable subject.
 One who is called in the commentaries an affectionate companion; for he
 is always in a joyous mood: he laughs first and speaks afterwards.
 He should be the first to be pervaded with unselfish joy.
 Or on seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy, cheerful, and
 joyous, unselfish joy can be aroused thus: "This being, verily, is happy!
 How good, how excellent!" For this is what is referred to in the Vibhanga:
 "And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart imbued
 with unselfish joy? Just as he would be joyful on seeing a dear and beloved
 person, so he pervades all being with unselfish joy" (Vibhanga 274).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if his affectionate friend or the dear person was happy in the past
 but is now unlucky and unfortunate, then unselfish joy can still be aroused
 by remembering his past happiness; or by anticipating that he will be happy
 and successful again in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having thus aroused unselfish joy with respect to a dear person, the meditator
 can then direct it towards a neutral one, and after that towards a hostile
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him, he should make
 it subside in the same way as described under the exposition of loving-kindness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He should then break down the barriers by means of impartiality towards
 the four, that is, towards these three and himself.
 And by cultivating the sign (or after-image, obtained in concentration),
 developing and repeatedly practicing it, he should increase the absorption
 to triple or (according to the Abhidhamma division) quadruple jhana.

 Milindapañha — Questions of MilindaThis collection of sutta-like passages
 recounts a long series of dialogues concerning profound points of Dhamma
 between the arahant Ven.
 Nagasena and the Bactrian Greek king Milinda (Menander).
 The king, a philosopher and skilled debater, poses to Ven.
 Nagasena one question after another concerning the Dhamma, each of which
 Ven.
 Nagasena masterfully answers, often with unusually vivid and apt similes.
 Like so many stories from the Pali canon, this one has a happy ending:
 the king is so deeply inspired by Ven.
 Nagasena's wisdom that he converts to Buddhism, hands over his kingdom
 to his son, joins the Sangha, and eventually becomes an arahant himself.

The Milindapañha has long been revered by Theravada Buddhists around the
 world because it addresses many questions of Buddhist doctrine of the sort
 that often come up in the course of Dhamma study and meditation practice:
 "Are pleasant feelings skillful or unskillful?" "What is the difference
 between someone with attachment and someone without?" "Can an arahant ever
 break a Vinaya rule?" "Is it better to perform an unwholesome act knowingly
 or unknowingly?" "How far away is the Brahma-world?" "Why are some people
 healthy and others ill; some people attractive and others ugly; some rich,
 and others poor?" All told, the king asks some 237 questions1 along these
 lines, making this one of the most comprehensive and useful Buddhist FAQs2
 in existence.

The Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the hordes of animals that roam the wild, whether the jungle, the
 mountains or the plain, the lion is universally recognized to be their
 chief.
 The living embodiment of self-possessed power, he is the most regal in
 manner and deportment, the mightiest, the foremost with respect to speed,
 courage and dominion.
 The expression of the lion's supremacy is its roar — a roar which reduces
 to silence the cries, howls, bellows, shrieks, barks and growls of lesser
 creatures.
 When the lion steps forth from his den and sounds his roar, all the other
 animals stop and listen.
 On such an occasion none dares even to sound its own cry, let alone to
 come into the open and challenge the fearless, unsurpassable roar of the
 golden-maned king of beasts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha's discourses, as found in the ancient Pali canon, frequently
 draw their imagery from the rich and varied animal life of the luxuriant
 Indian jungle.
 It is thus not surprising that when the Buddha has occasion to refer to
 himself, he chooses to represent himself as the stately lion and to describe
 his proclamation of the Dhamma, bold and thunderous, as a veritable lion's
 roar in the spiritual domain.
 The Majjhima Nikaya, the Collection of Middle Length Discourses, contains
 two suttas which bear this metaphor in their title.
 These two — No.
 11 and No.
 12 in the collection — are called respectively the Shorter Discourse on
 the Lion's Roar and the Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar.
 The variation in their titles, signalled by the Pali words cula, "minor,"
 and maha, "great," evidently refers at one level to their different lengths,
 the one being four pages in the Pali, the other sixteen.
 At another level, these different designations may allude to the relative
 weight of the subject matter with which they deal, the "great" discourse
 being a rare revelation by the Buddha of his exalted spiritual endowments
 and all-encompassing knowledge, which entitle him to "roar his lion's roar"
 in the assemblies of human beings and gods.
 Still, both suttas, as their controlling image suggests, are of paramount
 importance.
 Each delivers in its own way an eloquent and inspiring testimony to the
 uniquely emancipating nature of the Buddha's Teaching and the peerless
 stature of the Teacher among the spiritual guides of humanity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pali Commentaries explain that there are two kinds of lion's roar: that
 of the Buddha himself and that of his disciples.
 The former is sounded when the Buddha extols his own attainments or proclaims
 the potency of the doctrine he has realized; the latter, when accomplished
 disciples testify to their own achievement of the final goal, the fruit
 of arahantship.
 Viewed in the light of this distinction, the Shorter Discourse on the Lion's
 Roar exhibits a hybrid character, being a sutta spoken by the Buddha to
 instruct his disciples how they should affirm, in discussions with others
 who hold different convictions, the singular greatness of the Teaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 2.
 The Buddha opens the discourse by disclosing the content of this roar.
 He tells his monks that they can boldly declare that "only here" (idh'eva)
 — i.e., in the Dispensation of the Enlightened One — is it possible to find
 true recluses of the first, second, third and fourth degrees.
 The expression "recluse" (samana) here refers elliptically to the four
 grades of noble disciples who have reached the stages of realization at
 which final deliverance from suffering is irrevocably assured: the stream-enter
er, the once-returner, the non-returner and the arahant.
 The "doctrines of others" (parappavada), the Buddha says, are devoid of
 true recluses, of those who stand on these elevated planes.
 In order to understand this statement properly, it is important to distinguish
 exactly what the words imply and what they do not imply.
 The words do not mean that other religions are destitute of persons of
 saintly stature.
 Such religions may well engender individuals who have attained to a high
 degree of spiritual purity — beings of noble character, lofty virtue, deep
 contemplative experience, and rich endowment with love and compassion.
 These religions, however, would not be capable of giving rise to ariyan
 individuals, those equipped with the penetrative wisdom that can cut through
 the bonds that fetter living beings to samsara, the round of repeated birth
 and death.
 For such wisdom can only be engendered on a basis of right view — the view
 of the three characteristics of all conditioned phenomena, of dependent
 arising, and of the Four Noble Truths — and that view is promulgated exclusivel
y in the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Admittedly, this claim poses an unmistakable challenge to eclectic and universal
ist approaches to understanding the diversity of humankind's religious beliefs,
 but it in no way implies a lack of tolerance or good will.
 During the time of the Buddha himself, in the Ganges Valley, there thrived
 a whole panoply of religious teachings, all of which proposed, with a dazzling
 diversity of doctrines and practices, to show seekers of truth the path
 to liberating knowledge and to spiritual perfection.
 In his frequent meetings with uncommitted inquirers and with convinced
 followers of other creeds, the Buddha displayed the most complete tolerance
 and gracious cordiality.
 But though he was always ready to allow each individual to form his or
 her own convictions without the least constraint or coercion, he clearly
 did not subscribe to the universalist thesis that all religions teach essential
ly the same message, nor did he allow that the attainment of final release
 from suffering, Nibbana, was accessible to those who stood outside the
 fold of his own Dispensation.
 While this position may seem narrow and parochial to many today, when reaction
 against the presumptions of dogmatic religion has become so prevalent,
 it is not maintained by the Buddha as a hidebound dogma or from motives
 of self-exalting pride, but from a clear and accurate discernment of the
 precise conditions required for the attainment of deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha's statement on this issue emerges in at least two important passages
 in the Canon, each of which reveals, from a slightly different angle, exactly
 what those conditions are.
 One is found in the Maha-parinibbana Sutta (DN 16/ii,151-52).
 While the Buddha was lying between the twin sal trees on the eve of his
 demise, a wandering ascetic named Subhadda came into his presence to resolve
 a doubt: he wished to know whether or not the other great religious teachers
 contemporary with the Buddha, who were regarded as saints by the multitude,
 had actually attained spiritual realization, as they claimed to have done.
 The Buddha shifted the burden of the discussion away from a question aimed
 at assessing particular individuals and rephrased it in terms of a general
 evaluative principle.
 He declared: "In whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path
 is not found, there one cannot find true recluses of the four degrees of
 liberation.
 But in whatever Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found,
 there one can find the four types of true recluses." Then the Buddha imparted
 to Subhadda the information that was important for him to know: "In this
 Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found, and in it alone
 are found also the true recluses of the four degrees.
 Outside this Dispensation the four types of enlightened individuals are
 not to be found.
 The doctrines of others are devoid of true recluses." In this passage the
 thrust of the Buddha's explanation points to a particular method of practice
 as essential to the attainment of true realization.
 That method of practice is the training in the Noble Eightfold Path, and
 because this path, in its fullness and perfection, is unique to the Dispensatio
n of a Fully Enlightened One, it follows that persons who have reached the
 planes of deliverance are unique to his Dispensation as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar the reason for the Buddha's
 exclusivistic claim does not focus upon practice but upon doctrine, upon
 the understanding of the nature of reality that separates his own Dhamma
 from all other attempts to comprehend the human situation.
 As the argument unfolds, the Buddha will show that the essential key to
 liberation, the key that he alone makes available, is the teaching of anatta,
 of non-self or egolessness, which is at the same time the boundary line
 that marks the difference between his own doctrine and the doctrines of
 other teachers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sections 3-4.
 After announcing the "lion's roar" in Section 2, in the next section the
 Buddha begins to construct an imaginary dialogue between "the wanderers
 of other sects," i.e., the proponents of the rival religious systems, and
 his own ordained disciples, the bhikkhus.
 In the first stage of the discussion, the wanderers ask the bhikkhus about
 the grounds on which they advance their seemingly sweeping claim.
 The Buddha advises the monks that they should answer by mentioning four
 reasons: that they have confidence in the Teacher, they have confidence
 in his Teaching, they have fulfilled the precepts of training, and their
 co-religionists, both monastic and lay, live together in cordial harmony.
 The wanderers, however, do not remain satisfied with this answer, but join
 issue with the bhikkhus by pointing out that the four reasons that the
 Buddhists have offered are also found in their own sects.
 Thus there seems to be no essential distinction between them that the bhikkhus
 can appeal to as the basis for their thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 5.
 The Buddha does not meet this challenge with a direct reply, but instead
 approaches it via an indirect route.
 He enters upon this route by first clarifying, through questioning of the
 wanderers, the criteria of a truly emancipating teaching.
 As a matter of mutual consensus both the bhikkhus and the wanderers agree
 that such a teaching must posit a goal that can be attained only by those
 who have achieved complete purification: freedom from lust, hate and delusion,
 from craving and clinging, from arbitrary prejudices ("favoring and opposing"),
 and from the coils of "proliferation" (papañca), i.e., thought constructions
 born of craving and groundless speculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the bhikkhus and the wanderers both agree on these criteria, this
 does not suffice to establish that they are shared equally by the different
 spiritual systems, nor does this imply that they are capable of being fulfilled
 regardless of the specific doctrine to which one subscribes or the discipline
 in which one trains.
 To show, again in an indirect manner, that the outside systems are not
 capable of leading to final liberation, the Buddha points out that there
 are two broad "families" of views, diametrically opposed to each other,
 under which the wide diversity of speculative systems can be subsumed.
 These two views are called, in the sutta, the view of being (bhavaditthi)
 and the view of non-being (vibhavaditthi).
 The view of being is identical with eternalism (sassatavada), the positing
 of some eternal entity or spiritual principle, i.e., a substantial self or
 soul, as the essence of the individual, and the positing of an eternal
 entity, such as a creator God or metaphysical Absolute, as the ground or
 source of the objective universe.
 The view of non-being is identical with annihilationism (ucchedavada),
 the repudiation of any principle of continuity beyond death and the denial
 of an objective, transpersonal foundation for morality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While those who adhere to the former view do concur with the Buddhists in
 accepting the efficacy of spiritual practice, their teachings, according
 to the Buddha, are not free of an erroneous grasp of actuality.
 They spring from a deep clinging to the notion of a permanent self, which
 issues in an edifice of doctrine designed to substantiate that idea and
 guarantee the immortality of the imagined self.
 Hence the Buddha traces this view to its root in the craving for being
 (bhavatanha), and he maintains that those who adopt such a view are for
 that very reason the victims, even though unwittingly, of craving and attachmen
t.
 The view of non-being, on the other hand, arises from an attitude of contempt
 towards existence, and finds its root in the craving for non-being (vibhavatanh
a).
 The thinkers who adopt this view generally begin, as the Buddha does, by
 recognizing the pervasive nature of suffering; but instead of pursuing
 this suffering back to its true causes, they rush to an unwarranted extreme
 by declaring that the entire life-process comes to an absolute end with
 the breakup of the body at death, so that at death a being is annihilated
 and exists no more in any way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having isolated these two views and shown them in their mutual opposition,
 the Buddha then states that any "recluses or brahmans," i.e., spiritual teachers,
 who do not understand these views as they really are fail to measure up
 to the criteria of those who have achieved the final goal.
 They are still subject to lust, hatred and delusion, to craving and clinging,
 etc., and thus they cannot claim to be freed from the cycle of repeated
 birth and death.
 Only those who have comprehended these views, who see their dangers and
 have relinquished them, are accessible to the right view that leads beyond
 all erroneous extremes, and it is by the instrumentality of that view that
 they are capable of cutting off the defilements and arriving at release
 from the samsaric round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sections 9-15.
 Even at this point, however, the Buddha has not yet explicitly shown that
 liberation from cyclic existence is an exclusive prerogative of his own
 Dispensation.
 He has only left this conclusion as an inference for those who are already
 aware that his Dhamma makes known the middle way that transcends extremist
 views.
 In the present sequence, however, he will bring his argument to its conclusion
 by homing in on the crucial point that separates his own teaching from
 all other religious and philosophical systems.
 He takes up this task by way of an examination of the mental activity of
 clinging (upadana).
 He states that there are four kinds of clinging: (1) clinging to sense
 pleasures; (2) clinging to speculative views regarding the self and the
 world; (3) clinging to rules and observances, i.e., to external rules, rituals
 and austerities in the belief that they lead to liberation; (4) and clinging
 to a doctrine of self, i.e., to a view of a truly existent self.
 The last type of clinging, the subtlest and most elusive of the group,
 is tantamount to what the texts refer to as "personality view" (sakkayaditthi):
 the view of a substantial self taken to be either identical in some way
 to the five aggregates that constitute the personality, or to stand in
 some relationship to those aggregates (see MN 44/i,300, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha next points out that the recluses and brahmans who propose a
 path to liberation all declare that they propound "the full understanding
 of all kinds of clinging," a phrase the commentary to the sutta glosses
 as meaning the overcoming(samatikkama) of all kinds of clinging.
 However, the Buddha says, in spite of this claim, the other spiritual teachers
 recognize and attack only a limited number of the forms of clinging; at
 best, they might teach the overcoming of the first three forms of clinging.
 What they cannot teach, because they have not comprehended this for themselves,
 is the overcoming of clinging to a doctrine of self, and it is this fourth
 type of clinging that vitiates even the aspects of their teachings that
 are wholesome and praiseworthy.
 Because they perceive the dangers in the grosser types of clinging, they
 might urge their disciples to relinquish them, to give up sensuality, dogmatism
 and ritualism, and to cultivate in their place renunciation, detachment
 and equanimity.
 Thereby they can enjoin their disciples to engage in virtuous courses of
 spiritual practice, courses which have the potency to generate superior
 states of rebirth within the round of samsara.
 However, what they have not discovered, because of the insurmountable limits
 to their range of understanding, is the buried root of the entire cycle
 of repeated existence, which consists precisely in that adherence to the
 notion of self.
 For this reason, the Buddha maintains, such a Dhamma and Discipline cannot
 show the way to the uprooting of the belief in self, and he therefore concludes
 that it is "unemancipating, unconducive to peace" — the final peace of
 Nibbana.
 Being taught by one who is not a Fully Enlightened Buddha, such a system
 does not merit the confidence of those who can be satisfied with nothing
 less than complete release from all samsaric suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to other spiritual teachers, the Buddha continues, he himself,
 the Tathagata, describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging,
 inclusive of the clinging to a doctrine of self.
 Recognizing the danger in views of self, aware that all such views, no
 matter how lofty, are undermined by a fundamental cognitive error, he proclaims
 a path that leads to the eradication of views of self in all their bewildering
 variety.
 Hence, the Buddha says, his Dhamma and Discipline is truly emancipating,
 truly capable of leading to final peace, promulgated by a Fully Enlightened
 One, the proper field of confidence for seekers of liberation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sections 16-17.
 In the final sections of the discourse, the Buddha will validate his claim
 regarding the emancipating quality of his Dispensation by showing how a
 disciple who undertakes the practice of his teaching can reach the fruit
 of final deliverance.
 He first takes up the four kinds of clinging, the subject around which
 the preceding portion of the exposition revolved, and connects this topic
 with another major principle of his doctrine, dependent arising (paticca
 samuppada).
 By applying the principle of dependent arising, he traces clinging to its
 source in craving, and then, continuing this line of inquiry, he pursues
 the entire sequence of conditional factors at the base of samsara back
 to its deepest and most pernicious root, ignorance (avijja).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the final paragraph he introduces a bhikkhu who arrives at the culmination
 of the path: one who develops wisdom to the fullest extent, abandons all
 ignorance, and arouses the liberating knowledge.
 Such a one no longer clings through any kind of clinging: he has eradicated
 all four types of clinging, including the clinging to a doctrine of self,
 and with their eradication has attained the final goal, the personal realizatio
n of Nibbana right in this very life.

 explains "lion's roar" (sihanada) as meaning a supreme roar (setthanada),
 a fearless roar (abhitanada), and a roar which cannot be confuted (appatinada).
 It adds: The roar about the existence of these four types of recluse only
 here is the supreme roar.
 The absence of any fear on account of others when one advances such a claim
 makes it a fearless roar.
 As none of the rival teachers can rise up and say, "These recluses also
 exist in our Dispensation," it is a roar which cannot be confuted.2.Comy.:
 Even though the adherents of other sects all declare arahantship — understood
 in a general sense as spiritual perfection — to be the goal, they point
 to other attainments as the goal in accordance with their views.
 Thus the brahmans declare the Brahma-world to be the goal, the great ascetics
 declare the gods of Streaming Radiance, the wanderers the gods of Refulgent
 Glory, and the Ajivakas the non-percipient state, which they posit to be
 "infinite mind" (anantamanasa).3."Favoring and opposing" (anurodha-pativirodha):
 reacting with attraction through lust and with aversion through hatred.4.Prolifer
ation (papañca), according to Comy., generally means mental activity governed
 by craving, conceit and views, but here only craving and views are intended.5.The
 adoption of one view entailing opposition to the other links up with the
 earlier statement that the goal is for one who does not favor and oppose.6.Comy.
 mentions eight conditions which serve as the origin (samudaya) of these
 views: the five aggregates, ignorance, contact, perception, thought, unwise
 attention, bad friends, and the voice of another.
 Their disappearance (atthangama) is the path of stream-entry, which eradicates
 all wrong views.
 Their gratification (assada) may be understood as the satisfaction of psycholog
ical need to which the view caters, specifically the nurturing of craving
 for being by the eternalist view and of craving for non-being by the annihilati
onist view.
 Their danger (adinava) is the continued bondage they entail, by obstructing
 the acceptance of right view, which leads to liberation.
 And the escape from them (nissarana) is Nibbana.7.Comy.
 glosses full understanding (pariñña) here as overcoming (samatikkama),
 with reference to the commentarial notion of pahanapariñña, "full understanding
 as abandonment."8.This passage clearly indicates that the critical differentiatin
g factor of the Buddha's Dhamma is its "full understanding of clinging to
 a doctrine of self." This means, in effect, that the Buddha alone is able
 to show how to overcome all views of self by developing penetration into
 the truth of non-self (anatta).9.Comy.: The Buddha teaches how clinging to
 sense pleasures is abandoned by the path of arahantship, while the other
 three types of clinging are eliminated by the path of stream-entry.
 The path of stream-entry eliminates the other three clingings because these
 three are all forms of wrong view, and all wrong views are overcome at
 that stage.
 Although the statement that clinging to sense pleasures is abandoned by
 the path of arahantship may sound strange, in view of the fact that sensual
 desire is already eliminated by the non-returner, the Tika (subcommentary)
 to the sutta explains that in the present context the word kama, sense
 pleasure, should be understood to comprise all forms of greed, and the
 subtler types of greed are only eliminated with the attainment of arahantship.10.
This passage is explained in order to show how clinging is to be abandoned.
 Clinging is traced back, via the chain of dependent arising, to its root-cause
 in ignorance, and then the destruction of ignorance is shown to be the
 means to eradicate clinging.11.The Pali idiom, n'eva kamupadanam upadiyati,
 would have to be rendered literally as "he does not cling to the clinging
 to sense pleasures," which may obscure the sense more than it illuminates
 it.
 The word upadana in Pali is the object of its own verb form, while "clinging"
 in English is not.
 The easiest solution is to translate directly in accordance with the sense
 rather than to try to reproduce the idiom in translation.12.This is the stock
 canonical declaration of arahantship.

The Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Maha-sihanada Sutta, the Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar, is a text
 of awesome scope and power, one of those rare suttas in which the Buddha
 discloses the greatness and loftiness of his own spiritual endowments.
 Towards the end of the sutta, the Buddha says that he has reached his eightieth
 year, which allows us to place the discourse in the final year of his life.
 Thus the sutta serves as a convenient summation of the exalted qualities
 that enabled the Buddha to function so effectively as teacher and spiritual
 guide through the forty-five years of his mission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not typical of the Buddha to extol himself, for he did not intend
 his Dispensation to evolve into a personality cult centered around himself
 as a charismatic and powerful leader.
 Throughout his ministry he constantly emphasized the primacy of his role
 as guide, as the discoverer and proclaimer of the path.
 His task is not to command reverence, but to steer his disciples onto and
 along the path, for it is only the practice of the path, the cultivation
 of the training, that can effect the deep interior purification by which
 one can reach the extinction of the defilements and liberation from suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, while the Buddha functions primarily as the revealer of the path,
 confidence in him as the Supreme Teacher remains an essential element of
 the training.
 It is this confidence, freshly arisen, that induces the curious inquirer
 to cross the great divide that separates the admirer of the Dhamma from
 the practitioner, and it is this same confidence that drives the aspirant
 forward until the task of self-cultivation has been completed.
 Frequent reflection on the greatness of the Master inspires joy and courage,
 sustaining one's commitment during those dark periods when prospects for
 progress appear bleak, and desire and doubt — those twin conspirators —
 combine forces to attempt to persuade one of the futility of one's efforts.
 Hence, in order to provide a spur to awaken and nurture the confidence
 necessary to tread the path through its downward turns as well as its ascents,
 the Buddha on occasion offers us revelations of his "Buddha-gunas," the
 excellent qualities of a Fully Enlightened One that entitle him to serve
 as the first of the Three Gems and Three Refuges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most impressive of these rare disclosures is the Great Discourse
 on the Lion's Roar.
 Spoken as a rebuttal to the charges of a renegade disciple who, in the
 midst of the populous city of Vesali, had been denouncing the Buddha and
 attempting to dissuade others from following his teaching, the sutta recapitula
tes the various distinguished qualities of the Blessed One, with special
 emphasis upon his "ten Tathagata powers" (tathagatabala) and "four intrepiditie
s" (vesarajja); the sutta also affords us a glimpse of the demanding ordeal
 he underwent over many past aeons seeking the path to deliverance.
 When it was first spoken, the sutta had such a powerful impact on one monk
 in the assembly that his bodily hairs stood on end, and thus, during an
 early period, the sutta was known by the alternative title "The Hair-raising
 Discourse." Even today, centuries later, the Great Discourse on the Lion's
 Roar can continue to serve as a fecund source of inspiration.

 view is this: 'As long as this good man is still young, a black-haired
 young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, so
 long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom.
 But when this good man is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life,
 and come to the last stage, being eighty, ninety or a hundred years old,
 then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost.' But it should not be regarded
 so.
 I am now old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to
 the last stage: my years have turned eighty.
 Now suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years' lifespan, perfect
 in mindfulness, retentiveness, memory and lucidity of wisdom.21 Just as
 a skilled archer, trained, practiced and tested, could easily shoot a light
 arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, suppose that they were even to
 that extent perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, [83] memory and lucidity
 of wisdom.
 Suppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulne
ss and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer
 of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat,
 drink, consume food, taste, urinate, defecate and rest in order to remove
 sleepiness and tiredness.
 Still the Tathagata's exposition of the Dhamma, his explanations of factors
 of the Dhamma, and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end,
 but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years' lifespan
 would have died at the end of those hundred years.
 Sariputta, even if you have to carry me about on a bed, still there will
 be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagata's wisdom.

1.The story of Sunakkhatta's defection is found in the Patika Sutta (DN 24).
 He became dissatisfied with the Buddha and left the Order because the Buddha
 would not perform miracles for him or explain to him the beginning of things.
 He also showed great admiration for those who engaged in self-mortification,
 and probably resented the Buddha for emphasizing a "middle way" that condemned
 such extreme austerities as unprofitable.2.Superhuman states (uttari manussadhamm
a) are states, virtues or attainments higher than the ordinary human virtues
 comprised in the ten wholesome courses of action; they include the jhanas,
 direct knowledges (abhiñña), the paths and the fruits.
 "Distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones" (alamariyañana-d
assanavisesa), an expression frequently occurring in the suttas, signifies
 all higher degrees of meditative knowledge characteristic of the noble
 individual.
 In the present context, according to Comy., it means specifically the supramunda
ne path, which Sunakkhatta is thus denying of the Buddha.3.The thrust of his
 criticism is that the Buddha teaches a doctrine that he has merely worked
 out in thought rather than one he has realized through transcendental wisdom.
 Apparently, Sunakkhatta believes that being led to the complete destruction
 of suffering is, as a goal, inferior to the acquisition of miraculous powers.4.Al
l the sections to follow are intended as a rebuttal of Sunakkhatta's charge
 against the Buddha.
 Sections 6-8 cover the first three of the six direct knowledges, the last
 three appearing as the last of the ten powers of the Tathagata.
 The latter, according to Comy., are to be understood as powers of knowledge
 (ñanabala) that are acquired by all Buddhas as the outcome of their accumulatio
ns of merit.
 The Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides an elaborate analysis of
 them, the gist of which will be discussed in subsequent notes.5.Comy.: The
 Wheel of Brahma (brahmacakka) is the supreme, best, most excellent wheel,
 the Wheel of the Dhamma (dhammacakka).
 This has two aspects: the knowledge of penetration (pativedhañana) and
 the knowledge of teaching (desanañana).
 The knowledge of penetration, by which the Buddha penetrates the truth
 of the Dhamma, is produced from wisdom and leads to the attainment of the
 noble fruit for himself; the knowledge of teaching, by which the Buddha
 is qualified to expound the Dhamma perfectly to others, is produced from
 compassion and leads others to the attainment of the noble fruit.6.Comy.
 glosses thana as cause or ground (karana) and explains: "Such and such
 dhammas are causes (hetu), conditions (paccaya), for the arising of such
 and such dhammas: that is thana.
 Such and such dhammas are not causes, not conditions, for the arising of
 such and such dhammas: that is atthana.
 Knowing that, he understands thana as thana and atthana as atthana (i.e.,
 causal occasion as causal occasion, and non-causal occasion as non-causal
 occasion)." Comy.
 also refers to the different explanation in the Vibhanga, apparently regarding
 both explanations as acceptable.

 Section 809 explains this knowledge with reference to MN 115 as the Buddha's
 knowledge of what is possible and what is impossible, e.g., it is impossible
 that a person possessed of right view should regard any formations as permanent
 or as pleasurable, or anything whatever as self, while it is possible that
 a worldling will regard things in such an erroneous way.
 It is impossible for a person possessed of right view to commit the five
 heinous crimes (matricide, parricide, the murder of an arahant, the wounding
 of a Buddha, causing a schism in the Sangha), while it is possible for
 a worldling to commit such crimes, etc.
 etc.

 Section 810: "Herein, the Tathagata comprehends that there are some evil
 actions performed which do not mature because they are prevented from maturing
 by a fortunate rebirth, a fortunate body, a fortunate time, a fortunate
 effort, while there are some evil actions performed which mature because
 of an unfortunate rebirth, etc.
 There are some good actions which do not mature because of an unfortunate
 rebirth, etc., while there are some good actions which mature because of
 a fortunate rebirth, etc." (condensed).8.Vbh.
 Section 811: "Herein, the Tathagata comprehends thus: 'This is the path,
 this is the practice leading to hell, to the animal realm, to the plane
 of ghosts, to the human realm, to the realm of the gods, to deliverance.'
 " This knowledge will be elaborated upon below in Sections 35-42.9.Vbh.
 Section 812: "The Tathagata comprehends the different aggregates, the different
 sense bases, the different elements; he comprehends the different worlds
 that have many elements, different elements."10.Vbh.
 Section 813: "The Tathagata understands that beings are of inferior inclination
s and superior inclinations, and that they gravitate towards those who share
 their own inclinations" (condensed).11.Vbh.
 Sections 814-27 gives a detailed analysis.
 Comy.
 states the meaning more concisely as the Tathagata's knowledge of the superiori
ty and inferiority of beings' faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentra
tion and wisdom.12.Vbh.
 Section 828: "The defilement (sankilesa) is a state partaking of deterioration;
 cleansing (vodana) is a state partaking of distinction; emergence (vutthana)
 is both cleansing and the rising out of an attainment.
 The eight liberations (vimokkha) are enumerated, e.g., at DN 15/ii,70-71,
 and comprise three liberations pertaining to the realm of material form,
 the four immaterial attainments, and the cessation of perception and feeling.
 The nine attainments (samapatti) are the four jhanas, the four immaterial
 attainments, and cessation.13.The idiom yathabhatam nikkhitto evam niraye
 is knotty; the rendering here follows the gloss of Comy.: "He will be put
 in hell as if carried off and put there by the wardens of hell." Although
 such a fate may sound excessively severe merely for verbal denigration,
 it should be remembered that he is maligning a Fully Enlightened Buddha
 with a mind of hatred, and his intention in so doing is to discourage others
 from entering upon the path that could lead them to complete liberation
 from suffering.14.The four kinds of intrepidity (vesarajja: also rendered
 "grounds of self-confidence") may be divided into two pairs.
 The first pair relates mainly to the internal qualities of the Buddha,
 his achievement of personal perfection, while the second pair has an outward
 orientation, being concerned primarily with his qualifications as a teacher.
 The first intrepidity confirms his attainment of supreme enlightenment
 and the removal of all obscuration regarding the range of what may be known;
 it points to the Buddha's acquisition of omniscience (sabbaññutañana).
 The second underlines his complete purity through the destruction of all
 defilements; it points to his achievement of the fruit of arahantship.
 The third means that the Buddha's understanding of obstructions to the
 goal is unimpeachable, while the fourth confirms the efficacy of the Dhamma
 in accomplishing its intended purpose, namely, leading the practitioner
 to complete release from suffering.15.In later Buddhist tradition the asuras,
 titans or "anti-gods," are added as a separate realm to make the "six destinati
ons" familiar from the Tibetan Wheel of Life.16.Comy.: Even though the description
 is the same as that of the bliss of the heavenly world, the meaning is
 different.
 For the bliss of the heavenly world is not really extremely pleasant because
 the fevers of lust, etc.
 are still present there.
 But the bliss of Nibbana is extremely pleasant in every way through the
 subsiding of all fevers.17.Comy.
 explains that at this juncture the Buddha related this account of his past
 ascetic practices because Sunakkhatta was a great admirer of extreme asceticism
 (as is clear from the Patika Sutta) and the Buddha wanted to make it known
 that there was no one who could equal him in the practice of austerities.
 Sections 44-56 apparently deal with the Bodhisatta's striving during the
 six years' period of austerities in his last existence, while Sections
 57-61 refer back to his previous existences as a seeker of enlightenment.18.The
 "eight-days' interval of frost" is a regular cold spell which occurs in
 South Asia in late December or early January.19.That is, they hold the view
 that beings are purified by reducing their intake of food.20.Rebirth into
 the Pure Abodes (suddhavasa) is possible only for non-returners.21.The Pali
 for the four terms is: sati,gati,dhiti,paññaveyyattiya.
 Comy.
 explains sati as the ability to grasp in mind a hundred or a thousand phrases
 as they are being spoken; gati, the ability to bind them and retain them
 in the mind; dhiti, the ability to recite back what has been grasped and
 retained; and paññaveyyattiya, the ability to discern the meaning and logic
 of those phrases.22.The Venerable Nagasamala had been a personal attendant
 of the Buddha during the first twenty years of his ministry.23.Lomahamsanapariyay

Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we contemplate even a minute sector of the vast range of life, we are
 faced with such a tremendous variety of life's manifestations that it defeats
 description.
 And yet three basic statements can be made that are valid for all animate
 existence, from the microbe up to the creative mind of a human genius.
 These features common to all life were first found and formulated over
 2500 years ago by the Buddha, who was rightly called "Knower of the Worlds"
 (loka-vidu).
 They are the Three Characteristics (ti-lakkha.na) of all that is conditioned,
 i.e., dependently arisen.
 In English renderings, they are also sometimes called Signs, Signata, or
 Marks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These three basic facts of all existence are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Impermanence or Change (anicca)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suffering or Unsatisfactoriness (dukkha)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not-self or Insubstantiality (anattaa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first and the third apply to inanimate existence as well, while the
 second (suffering) is, of course, only an experience of the animate.
 The inanimate, however, can be, and very often is, a cause of suffering
 for living beings: for instance, a falling stone may cause injury or loss
 of property may cause mental pain.
 In that sense, the three are common to all that is conditioned, even to
 what is below or beyond the normal range of human perception.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Existence can be understood only if these three basic facts are comprehended,
 and this not only logically, but in confrontation with one's own experience.
 Insight-wisdom (vipassanaa-pa~n~naa) which is the ultimate liberating factor
 in Buddhism, consists just of this experience of the three characteristics
 applied to one's own bodily and mental processes, and deepened and matured
 in meditation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To "see things as they really are" means seeing them consistently in the
 light of the three characteristics.
 Ignorance of these three, or self-deception about them, is by itself a
 potent cause for suffering — by knitting, as it were, the net of false
 hopes, of unrealistic and harmful desires, of false ideologies, false values
 and aims of life, in which man is caught.
 Ignoring or distorting these three basic facts can only lead to frustration,
 disappointment, and despair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, from a positive as well as a negative angle, this teaching on the
 Three Basic Facts of Existence is of such vital importance that it was
 thought desirable to add here more material to those brief expositions
 that had already appeared in this series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beginning with the present volume on Impermanence, each of the Three Characteris
tics will receive separate treatment by different authors and from different
 angles, with a great variety of approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these three publications will be concluded by an essay of the late
 Venerable Ñanamoli Thera, in which all important canonical source material
 on the respective Characteristic is collected, systematized, and discussed.
 These tersely written articles merit close study and will be found very
 helpful in the analytical as well as meditative approach to the subject.
 Regrettably, the premature death of the venerable author prevented him
 from writing a fourth article planned by him, which was to deal with the
 interrelation of the Three Characteristics.
\end_layout

These three articles of the Venerable Ñanamoli were originally written for
 the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, and the first one, on Anicca, appeared in
 Volume I, p.

It is a common sight in Buddhist lands to see the devotees offer flowers
 and light oil lamps before a Buddha image.
 They are not praying to the Buddha or to any "supernatural being." The flowers

 of all conditioned things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is this single and simple word Impermanence (anicca) which is the very
 core of the Buddha's teaching, being also the basis for the other two character
istics of existence, Suffering and No-self.
 The fact of Impermanence means that reality is never static but is dynamic
 throughout, and this the modern scientists are realizing to be the basic
 nature of the world without any exception.
 In his teaching of dynamic reality, the Buddha gave us the master key to
 open any door we wish.
 The modern world is using the same master key, but only for material achievemen
ts, and is opening door after door with amazing success.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal
 existence.
 We cannot say of anything, animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic,
 "this is lasting"; for even while we are saying this, it would be undergoing
 change.
 All is fleeting; the beauty of flowers, the bird's melody, the bee's hum,
 and a sunset's glory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose yourself gazing on a gorgeous sunset.
 The whole western heavens are glowing with roseate hues; but you are aware
 that within half an hour all these glorious tints will have faded away
 into a dull ashen gray.
 You see them even now melting away before your eyes, although your eyes
 cannot place before you the conclusion which your reason draws.
 And what conclusion is that? That conclusion is that you never, even for
 the shortest time that can be named or conceived, see any abiding color,
 any color which truly is.
 Within the millionth part of a second the whole glory of the painted heavens
 has undergone an incalculable series of mutations.
 One shade is supplanted by another with a rapidity which sets all measurements
 at defiance, but because the process is one to which no measurements apply,...
 reason refuses to lay an arrestment on any period of the passing scene,
 or to declare that it is, because in the very act of being it is not; it
 has given place to something else.
 It is a series of fleeting colors, no one of which is, because each of
 them continually vanishes in another.

All component things — that is, all things which arise as the effect of
 causes, and which in turn give rise to effects — can be crystallized in
 the single word anicca, impermanence.
 All tones, therefore, are just variations struck on the chord which is
 made up of impermanence, suffering (unsatisfactoriness), and no-self nor
 soul — anicca, dukkha, and anattaa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Camouflaged, these three characteristics of life prevail in this world until
 a supremely Enlightened One reveals their true nature.
 It is to proclaim these three characteristics — and how through complete
 realization of them, one attains to deliverance of mind — that a Buddha
 appears.
 This is the quintessence, the sum total of the Buddha's teaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the concept of anicca applies to all compounded and conditioned
 things, the Buddha is more concerned with the so-called being; for the
 problem is with man and not with dead things.
 Like an anatomist who resolves a limb into tissues and tissues into cells,
 the Buddha, the Analyzer (Vibhajjavaadi), analyzed the so-called being,
 the sankhaara pu~nja, the heap of processes, into five ever-changing aggregates
, and made it clear that there is nothing abiding, nothing eternally conserved,
 in this conflux of aggregates (khandhaa santati).
 They are: — — material form or body; feeling or sensation; perception;
 mental formations; consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Enlightened One explains:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five aggregates, monks, are anicca, impermanent; whatever is impermanent,
 that is dukkha, unsatisfactory; whatever is dukkha, that is without attaa,
 self.
 What is without self, that is not mine, that I am not, that is not my self.
 Thus should it be seen by perfect wisdom (sammappa~n~naaya) as it really
 is.
 Who sees by perfect wisdom, as it really is, his mind, not grasping, is
 detached from taints; he is liberated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 22.45
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Naagarjuna only echoes the words of the Buddha when he says: When the notion
 of an Aatman, Self or Soul cease, the notion of 'mine' also ceases and
 one becomes free from the idea of I and mine (Maadhyamika-Kaarikaa, xviii.2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha gives five very striking similes to illustrate the ephemeral
 nature of the five aggregates.
 He compares material form to a lump of foam, feeling to a bubble, perception
 to a mirage, mental formations to a plantain trunk (which is pithless,
 without heartwood), and consciousness to an illusion, and asks: "What essence,
 monks, could there be in a lump of foam, in a bubble, in a mirage, in a
 plantain trunk, in an illusion?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing, the Buddha says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever material form there be: whether past, future, or present; internal
 or external; gross or subtle; low or lofty; far or near; that material
 form the monk sees, meditates upon, examines with systematic attention,
 he thus seeing, meditating upon, and examining with systematic attention,
 would find it empty, he would find it insubstantial and without essence.
 What essence, monks, could there be in material form?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha speaks in the same manner of the remaining aggregates and asks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What essence, monks, could there be in feeling, in perception, in mental
 formations and in consciousness?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 22.95
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we see that a more advanced range of thought comes with the analysis
 of the five aggregates.
 It is at this stage that right understanding known as insight (vipassanaa)
 begins to work.
 It is through this insight that the true nature of the aggregates is grasped
 and seen in the light of the three characteristics (ti-lakkhana), namely:
 impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and no-self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not only the five aggregates that are impermanent, unsatisfactory,
 and without self, but the causes and conditions that produce the aggregates
 are also impermanent, unsatisfactory, and without self.
 This point the Buddha makes very clear:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Material form, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness,
 monks, are impermanent (anicca).
 Whatever causes and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates,
 they, too, are impermanent.
 How monks, could aggregates arisen from what is impermanent, be permanent?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Material form...
 and consciousness, monks, are unsatisfactory (dukkha); whatever causes
 and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates, they too
 are unsatisfactory.
 How, monks, could aggregates arise from what is unsatisfactory be pleasant
 or pleasurable?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Material form...
 and consciousness, monks, are without a self (anattaa); whatever causes
 and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates, they, too
 are without self.
 How, monks, could aggregates arise from what is without self be self (attaa)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The instructed noble disciple (sutavaa ariyasaavako), monks, seeing thus
 becomes dispassionate towards material form, feeling, perception, mental
 formations and consciousness: Through dispassion he is detached; through
 detachment he is liberated; in liberation the knowledge comes to be that
 he is liberated, and he understands: Destroyed is birth, lived is the life
 of purity, done is what was to be done, there is no more of this to come
 [meaning that there is no more continuity of the aggregates, that is, no
 more becoming or rebirth].

 in their respective and objective natures, (aayatanaana.m aayatana.t.ta.m)
 and go after mirages and deceptions.
 The sense organs delude and mislead us and then we fail to see things in
 their true light, so that our way of seeing things becomes perverted (vipariita
 dassana).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha speaks of three kinds of illusion or perversions (vipallaasa,
 Skt.
 viparyaasa) that grip man's mind, namely: the illusions of perception,
 thought, and view (sa~n~naa vipallaasa; citta vipallaasa; di.t.thi vipallaasa).2
 Now when a man is caught up in these illusions he perceives, thinks, and
 views incorrectly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He perceives permanence in the impermanent; satisfactoriness in the unsatisfacto
ry (ease and happiness in suffering); self in what is not self (a soul in
 the soulless); beauty in the repulsive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thinks and views in the same erroneous manner.
 Thus each illusion works in four ways (AN 4.49), and leads man astray, clouds
 his vision, and confuses him.
 This is due to unwise reflections, to unsystematic attention (ayoniso manasikaa
ra).
 Right understanding (or insight meditation — vipassanaa) alone removes
 these illusions and helps man to cognize the real nature that underlies
 all appearance.
 It is only when man comes out of this cloud of illusions and perversions
 that he shines with true wisdom like the full moon that emerges brilliant
 from behind a black cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregates of mind and body, being ever subject to cause and effect,
 as we saw above, pass through the inconceivably rapid moments of arising,
 presently existing, and ceasing (uppaada, .thiti, bha"nga), just as the
 unending waves of the sea or as a river in flood sweeps to a climax and
 subsides.
 Indeed, human life is compared to a mountain stream that flows and rushes
 on, changing incessantly (AN 7.70) "nadisoto viya," like a flowing stream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heraclitus, that renowned Greek philosopher, was the first Western writer
 to speak about the fluid nature of things.
 He taught the Panta Rhei doctrine, the flux theory, at Athens, and one
 wonders if that teaching was transmitted to him from India.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"There is no static being," says Heraclitus, "no unchanging substratum.
 Change, movement, is Lord of the Universe.
 Everything is in a state of becoming, of continual flux (Panta Rhei)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He continues: "You cannot step twice into the same river; for fresh waters
 are ever flowing in upon you." Nevertheless one who understands the root
 of the Dhamma would go a step further and say: The same man cannot step
 twice into the same river; for the so called man who is only a conflux
 of mind and body, never remains the same for two consecutive moments."3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should now be clear that the being whom for all practical purposes we
 call a man, woman, or individual, is not something static, but kinetic,
 being in a state of constant and continuous change.
 Now when a person views life and all that pertains to life in this light,
 and understands analytically this so-called being as a mere succession
 of mental and the bodily aggregates, he sees things as they really are
 (yathaabhuutam).
 He does not hold the wrong view of "personality belief," belief in a soul
 or self (sakkaaya di.t.thi), because he knows through right understanding
 that all phenomenal existence is causally dependent (pa.ticca-samuppanna),
 that each is conditioned by something else, and that its existence is relative
 to that condition.
 He knows that as a result there is no "I," no persisting psychic entity,
 no ego principle, no self or anything pertaining to a self in this life
 process.
 He is, therefore, free from the notion of a microcosmic soul (jiivaatma)
 or a macrocosmic soul (paramaatma).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is said that through insight meditation (vipassanaa) one sees things
 as they really are (yathaabhuutam) and not as they appear to be.
 Viewing things as they really are implies, as we discussed above, seeing
 the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and no-self nature of all conditioned
 and component things.
 To such a meditative disciple of the Buddha the "world" is not the external
 or the empirical world, but the human body with its consciousness.
 It is the world of the five aggregates of clinging (pa~nca upaadaanakkhandaa).
 It is this that he tries to understand as impermanent, unsatisfactory,
 and without self or soul.
 It is to this world of body and mind that the Buddha referred to when he
 said to Mogharaaja, "Ever mindful, Mogharaaja, see the world as void (su~n~na);
 having given up the notion of a self [underlying it] — so may one overcome
 death (Maara); The King of Death sees not one who thus knows the world"
 (Sutta Nipaata).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sum total of the philosophy of change taught in Buddhism is that all
 component things that have conditioned existence are a process and not
 a group of abiding entities, but the changes occur in such rapid succession
 that people regard mind and body as static entities.
 They do not see their arising and their breaking up (udaya-vaya), but regard
 them unitarily, see them as a lump or whole (ghana sa~n~naa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is very hard, indeed, for people who are accustomed to continually think
 of their own mind and body and the external word with mental projections
 as wholes, as inseparable units, to get rid of the false appearance of
 "wholeness." So long as man fails to see things as processes, as movements,
 he will never understand the anatta (no-soul) doctrine of the Buddha.
 That is why people impertinently and impatiently put the question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If there is no persisting entity, no unchanging principle, like self or
 soul what is it that experiences the results of deeds here and hereafter?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two different discourses (MN 109; SN 22.82) deal with this burning question.
 The Buddha was explaining in detail to his disciples the impermanent nature
 of the five aggregates, how they are devoid of self, and how the latent
 conceits "I am" and "mine" cease to exist.
 Then there arose a thought in the mind of a certain monk thus: "Material
 body is not self, feeling is not self, perception is not self, mental formation
s are not self, consciousness is not self.
 Then what self do selfless deeds affect?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha, reading the thought of the monk's mind, said, "The question
 was beside the point" and made the monk understand the impermanent, unsatisfact
ory, and non-self nature of the aggregates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is wrong to say that the doer of the deed is the same as the one who
 experiences its results.
 It is equally wrong to say that the doer of the deed and the one who experience
s its results are two different persons,"4 for the simple reason that what
 we call life is a flow of psychic and physical processes or energies, arising
 and ceasing constantly; it is not possible to say that the doer himself
 experiences results because he is changing now, every moment of his life;
 but at the same time you must not forget the fact that the continuity of
 life that is the continuance of experience, the procession of events is
 not lost; it continues without a gap.
 The child is not the same as an adolescent, the adolescent is not the same
 as the adult, they are neither the same nor totally different persons (na
 ca so na ca a~n~no, — Milinda Pa~nho).
 There is only a flow of bodily and mental processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three types of teachers, the first one teaches that the ego or
 the self is real now as well as in the future (here and hereafter); the
 second one teaches that the ego is real only in this life, not in the future;
 the third one teaches that the concept of an ego is an illusion: it is
 not real either in this life or in the hereafter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first one is the eternalist (sassatavaadi); the second one is the annihilati
onist (ucchedavaadi); the third one is the Buddha who teaches the middle
 way of avoiding the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism.
 (Here the middle way is the doctrine of dependent arising, or causal conditioni
ng — Paticca Samuppaada).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All theistic religions teach that the ego survives after death in some way
 or other, and is not annihilated.
 The materialist's concept is that the ego is annihilated at death.
 The Buddhist view is that there is no ego, or anything substantial, or
 lasting, but all things conditioned are subject to change, and they change
 not remaining the same for two consecutive moments, and that there is a
 continuity but no identity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So long as man cherishes the idea of the lasting self or ego it will not
 be possible for him to conceive the idea that all things are impermanent,
 that there is, in reality, an arising and a ceasing of things (samudaya
 dhamma, vaya dhamma, — Satipa.t.thaana sutta).
 The understanding of the anatta doctrine, which is exclusively Buddhist,
 is indispensable in the understanding of the four noble truths and the
 other principal tenets of Buddhism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The people of the world today mark the changing nature of life.
 Although they see it, they do not keep it in mind and act with dispassionate
 discernment.
 Though change again and again speaks to them and makes them unhappy, they
 pursue their mad career of whirling round the wheel of existence and are
 twisted and torn between the spokes of agony.
 They cherish the belief that it is possible to discover a way of happiness
 in this very change, to find a center of security in this circle of impermanenc
e.
 They imagine that although the world is uncertain they can make it certain
 and give it a solid basis, and so the unrelenting struggle for worldly
 improvement goes on with persevering effort and futile enthusiasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
History has proved again and again and will continue to prove that nothing
 in this world is lasting.
 All things when clung to fail.
 Nations and civilizations rise, flourish, and die away as waves upon the
 ocean, yielding place to new, and thus the scrolls of time record the passing
 pageant, the baseless vision, and the fading flow that is human history.

\begin_layout Standard
Insights and discoveries revealed to human minds 2500 years ago, at the
 time of the Buddha (or even several centuries before that time), may have
 caused deep and revolutionary effects in the evolution of existing world
 views, no less important than the discoveries of Galileo and Copernicus
 have been for the eventual collapse of the world-view of medieval Christian
 civilization.
 These latter discoveries, which mark the outset of modern civilization,
 have become so much a part of commonplace or general information that they
 can be imparted to children in the lowest grades of elementary education,
 and are normally absorbed by them without difficulty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of impermanence and of ceaseless change, due to the never-ending
 "chain" of causes and effects (the subject which we are attempting to approach
 in its Buddhist version of aniccam) has, in its broad meaning, become one
 of our stereotyped and oversimplified truisms, reduced, both in its formal
 and substantial significance, to a mere rudiment of conventional word-meaning.
 As such, it may still have impressed us on the level of nursery rhymes
 and even of some grammar-school classics in the history of literature.
 (If I had to choose a deeper adequation33 founded on a modern poet's more
 complex philosophical intuition, I would not hesitate to select the lines
 from T.S.
 Eliot's Quartets;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ash on an old man's sleeve Is all the ash the burnt roses leave ...
 Water and fire succeed The town, the pasture and the weed.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We might hope to rediscover the original significance and historical purport
 of such truisms only if we were to look for them purposively, guided by
 some subjective impressions of individual or particular cases, and by the
 consequences of their concrete application in actual scientific or philosophica
l theories.
 This is what I am about to hint at in a few examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One: As a young teacher, when for the first time I tried to explain to children
 of about twelve years of age the biological process of growing cabbages
 and potatoes, my emphasis on the importance of dung (I did not use the
 technical term "fertilizer") happened to be so impressive that the next
 day a mother came to complain against my "direct method" and "drastic naturalis
m" in visual teaching.
 Her child had been so affected by my discourse as to develop an acute loathing
 against food.
 Thus I was impressed how easily our most commonplace truisms about the
 laws of nature — whose discovery, once upon a time, may have been treated
 and even punished as revolutionary by respectable and authoritative social
 institutions — can still reveal themselves unexpectedly in their full overpower
ing force to the fresh and innocent minds of new generations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two: In my own generation of teenagers, between the two wars in Europe,
 the deadlock between science and religion was so complete that secondary
 school curricula were bound to provoke in our minds an unavoidable crisis
 of conscience.
 Teachers on the whole were totally involved in this struggle of convictions,
 keen to win us over to one side or the other.
 The side of science against religion was normally the stronger.
 Since that time religion, defeated in Europe, has become more and more
 a prohibited fruit, and has therefore acquired a new attractive force for
 juvenile minds.
 This is true not only in the eastern parts of Europe, since science is
 far from being a privilege of Communism.
 An anti-scientific tendency in Europe ("continental") philosophy has even
 become predominant, on account of the moral catastrophe which still preoccupies
 the minds of our generation beyond any other problem of "man's position
 in the universe."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central issue in this conflict between science and religion, at least
 from our youthful bias at that time, was of course the problem of anattaa
 ("no-soul"), to express it by the corresponding Buddhist term.
 Laws governing processes of causes and effects were, however, scientifically
 explained — or at least so understood by our unripe minds, under the impression
 of the open dispute between science and (Christian) religion.
 The explanations were not yet in terms of the scientific equivalent to
 a pure annica-vaado (theory of impermanence), which would imply a denial
 of the underlying material substantiality of the world.
 Instead of that, explanations given to us at that time still followed the
 classical Greek pattern of mechanistic materialism or static atomism, which
 was the closest to the Buddhist understanding of the uccheda-vaado (theory
 of destruction), whose believers are described in Pali texts in the following
 terms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...He then hears the Perfect One expounding the teaching for the removal of
 all grounds for "views," of all prejudices, obsessions, dogmas, and biases,
 for the stilling of all processes, for the relinquishment of all substrata
 of existence, for the extirpation of craving, for dispassion, cessation,
 extinction.
 He then thinks, "I shall be annihilated, I shall be destroyed! No longer
 shall I exist!" Hence he grieves, is depressed and laments; beating his
 breast, he weeps, and dejection befalls him.
 Thus, bhikkhus, is there anxiety about realities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— MN 22
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To this, the only authentic answer is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since in this very life a tathaagata (in this case generally understood
 as a human being in the widest sense) is not to be regarded as existing
 in truth, in reality, is it proper for you to assert: "as I understand
 the doctrine taught by the Exalted One, insofar as a bhikkhu has destroyed
 the aasavas [life's "intoxicants" or passions] he is broken up and perishes
 when body is broken up, he exists not after death."?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 22.85
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The logical possibility of such an answer is excluded by the premise.
 The same premise, however, excludes also the opposite, affirmative, possibility.
 (We shall return to this problem, as understood by contemporary philosophy,
 in section Five.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is important to underline here that, on the same premise, uccheda-vaado,
 or simply the materialistic belief in a substantial "destruction" of any
 form of being, is the extreme opposite of any authentic nihilism in ontology
 and epistemology (theory of being and theory of knowledge).
 Only an explicitly idealistic philosophy, "looking upon the world as a
 bubble, as a mirage" (Dhp 170) can be nihilistic in some respect, while
 uccheda-vaado as a "theory of destruction" necessarily presupposes an existenti
ally rooted belief in material substance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just in this sense, in the midst of the battle-ground between science
 and religion, and on the eve of a world war, that the children of the first
 half of the 20th century had to face the fatality of a physical and moral
 destruction, scientifically and infallibly precalculated, as experience
 was about to prove.
 Yet just over the edge of our intellectual horizon was dawning a time,
 for science at least, of acquiring a completely different position vis-a-vis
 the problem of impermanence and relativity as affecting the deepest subatomic
 structure of the world — a position considerably closer to the Buddhist
 idea of aniccam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three: Since 1927, Bertrand Russell's book, An Outline of Philosophy, has
 been widely quoted as one of the best popular presentations of the radical
 change in the scientific world-view stemming from Einstein's theory of
 relativity and of the resulting development of nuclear physics.
 I shall try to elicit from Russell's statements, as far as the present
 draft of pointers to our essential problem may permit, the rejection of
 the substance-view by modern science, because it is the rejection of the
 substance-view that constitutes the core of the Buddhist anicca-vaado as
 a foundation (at least in the ti-lakkha.nam scheme) of both dukkham and
 anattaa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start with, let us define the idea of physical "substance" by means of
 its basic description and philosophical implication has stated in the Sutta-pi.t
akam sources.
 The problem of substance, as defined by scientific (lokaa-yatam) theories
 at the time of the Buddha, finds its classical formulation, categorial
 delimitation and solution in concise terms in his concluding answer to
 Kevaddho:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where do earth, water, fire, and wind; long and short; fine and coarse;
 pure and impure, no footing find?

For the categorical relation of mind and matter (or "name and form," naamaa
 ruupam, as implied in the foregoing formulation), the following statement
 of the Buddha is the most adequate and also the best-known in connection
 with our subject:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be better, bhikkhus, for the unlearned worldling to regard this
 body, built up of the four elements, as his self rather than the mind.
 For it is evident that this body may last for a year, for two years, for
 three, four, five or ten years...
 or even for a hundred years and more.
 But that which is called thought, or mind, or consciousness, continuously,
 during day and night, arises as one thing, and passes away as another thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 12.61
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, let us get a few quotations from Bertrand Russell.4 First, as regards
 substance-matter, he says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In former days, you could believe it on a philosophical ground that the
 soul is a substance and all substances are indestructible...
 But the notion of substance, in the sense of a permanent entity with changing
 states, is no longer applicable to the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A wave in the sea persists for a longer or shorter time: the waves that
 I see dashing themselves to pieces on the Cornish coast may have come all
 the way from Brazil, but that does not mean that a "thing" has traveled
 across the Atlantic; it means only that a certain process of change has
 traveled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Einstein's theory of relativity] has philosophical consequences which are,
 if possible, even more important.
 The substitution of space-time for space and time has made the category
 of substance less applicable than formerly, since the essence of substance
 was persistent through time, and there is now no one cosmic time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that matter, in modern science, has lost its solidity and substantialit
y; it has become a mere ghost haunting the scenes of its former splendor...
 The notion of matter, in modern physics, has become absorbed into the notion
 of energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We cannot say that "matter is the cause of our sensations."...
 In a word, "matter" has become no more than a conventional shorthand for
 stating causal laws concerning events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we are committed to causation as an a priori belief without which we
 should have no reason for supposing that there is a "real" chair (or any
 thing) at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, as regards the theory of events, we note that the idea of fixed and
 static elements of "matter" has been replaced by that of undeterminable
 "events" corresponding to the quantum electrodynamic field theory in nuclear
 physics, which comes very close to the conception of a non-physical but
 purely phenomenological idea of dhammaa, implied in its primitive significance
 by kha.nika-vaado, or theory of momentariness, of the Abhidhamma-pi.takam.
 (This latter aspect, explicitly philosophical, will be sketched in Five,
 below.) Of this Russell writes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything in the world is composed of "events."...
 An "event" is something occupying a small finite amount of space-time...
 Events are not impenetrable, as matter is supposed to be; on the contrary,
 every event in space-time is overlapped by other events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I assume that every event is contemporaneous with events that are not contempora
neous with each other; this is what is meant by saying that every event
 lasts for a finite time...
 Time is wholly relational.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Space-time order, as well as space-time points, results from the relations
 between events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compare with this last statement, and with those that follow, the assertion
 of Buddhaghosa in Atthasaalini: "By time the sage described the mind, and
 by mind described the time."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, Russell says of mental events:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important group of events, namely percepts, may be called "mental."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mentality is an affair of causal laws, not of the quality of single events,
 and also, mentality is a matter of degree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is mind?...
 Mind must be a group of mental events, since we have rejected the view
 that it is a single simple entity such as the ego was formerly supposed
 to be...
 Its constitution corresponds however to "the unity of one 'experience.'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of these considerations, Russell concludes that "first of all,
 you must cut out the word 'I': the person who believes is an inference,
 not a part of what you know immediately."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the logical possibility of an uccheda-vaado (theory of destruction)
 "heresy" is explicitly eliminated even on this level of merely scientific
 considerations: "Is a mind a structure of material units? I think it is
 clear that the answer to this question is in the negative."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can conclude this survey by accepting without any further reserve Russell's
 statement: "The problems we have been raising are none of them new, but
 they suffice to show that our everyday views of the world and of our relations
 to it are unsatisfactory."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four: Recently, field theory, as a replacement for the abandoned substance
 theory in physics, has found increasing application — at least as a hypothetica
l analogy — in other spheres of scientific thought, and even more in philosophic
al speculations limited to possible (and sometimes to impossible) extensions
 of "special sciences." Its application to parapsychology is of particular
 interest, for the extension of the subject in which we are interested is
 beyond the strictly physical sphere of being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is Gardner Murphy who has given us the most consequent and exclusive
 elaboration of a parapsychological analogy of field theory, as far as I
 know.
 A summarized recapitulation of his thesis is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action of living matter on living matter is never a case of single cell
 acting only on single cell.
 The structural whole or field is always involved.
 The field principle may hold in psychics as well as in physics, and a psychic
 field may extend backwards and forwards in time as well as onwards in space.
 The question, "Does personality survive death?" is therefore in Murphy's
 view not a reasonable question to ask.
 If any psychical activity survives, it will become an aspect of different
 fields and will thus take on new qualities and new structural relationships.
 It is evident that for him "all personal activities are constantly changing
 context and interacting with those of others, and it may be that each one
 becomes part of the cosmic process."5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another worker in the field of parapsychology, C.
 G.
 Broad, investigating The Mind and Its Place in Nature from the standpoint
 of a possible "survival" of the "PSI component," draws the conclusion,
 from the same basic analogy with physics, that "we need no longer suppose
 that, although a surviving PSI component may be bodiless, it is necessarily
 unextended and unlocalized, for we are nowadays well accustomed to such
 phenomena as electro-magnetic fields which cannot be called bodies in the
 ordinary sense but which still have structure and definite properties and
 dispositions.
 We must not think of it (i.e., of the surviving PSI-component) as something
 on which an experience makes an impression as a seal does on a ball of
 wax.
 On the contrary, such a substanceless theory implies a greater degree of
 survival than the mere persistence of an inactive PSI component."6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exponents of the same parapsychological theory also maintain that their
 hypothesis might offer a more adequate basis for explanation of subconscious
 phenomena investigated by psychoanalysis, particularly Jung's archetypes,
 than the initial Freudian attempts, which have been characterized since
 the first as a scientifically untenable Platonic analogy with "pigeon holes"
 as the basic structure of the soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these more or less ad hoc analogies with the field theory in physics
 can be brought down as well to an earlier metaphysical hypothesis, formulated
 on a broader philosophical basis already by William James, in his Pluralistic
 Universe (1909).7 Speaking of the structure of "our inner life," James says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every bit of us at every moment is part and parcel of a wider self...
 May not you and I be confluent in a higher consciousness, and confluently
 active there, though we now know it not?...
 The analogies with...
 facts of psychical research, so called, and with those of religious experience,
 establish...
 a decidedly formidable probability in favor [of the following pluralistic
 hypothesis:]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why should we envelop our many with the "one" that brings so many poisons
 in its train?...
 [instead of accepting] along with the superhuman consciousness the notion
 that it is not all-embracing; the notion, in other words, that there is
 a God, but that he is finite, either in power or in knowledge, or in both
 at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is exactly the basic distinction between the Vedaantic and the Buddhist
 conception of God, or gods, implying also the reason why James, in some
 respects, was in favor of a polytheistic conception, as a "result of our
 criticism of the absolute," in the same context.

\begin_layout Standard
Five: Such adaptation of hypotheses borrowed ad hoc from heterogenous fields
 of science could and should be ultimately verified and explained only by
 proper philosophical investigation, using autonomous methods and established
 on its own, purely anthropological ground.
 Since the beginning of the 20th century this has indeed been done, always
 more clearly and explicitly.
 The results have been considerable, at least as far as the problem of our
 primordial concern is involved: the human value aspect of aniccam, its
 fundamental significance in connection with both dukkham and anattaa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proper philosophical attitude was defined, not as pertaining to the
 physical but rather to the historical world-view, as early as the end of
 the 19th century, by Wilhelm Dilthey, founder of the modern philosophy
 of culture:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final pronouncement of the historical world-view is that human accomplishmen
t of every sort is relative, that everything is moving in process and nothing
 is stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet this historical orientation has not maintained a position of predominant
 importance in 20th century European philosophy.
 The most prominent philosopher of culture in the middle of this century,
 Karl Jaspers, in discussing the priority of the question "What is man?"
 (As formulated by Kant) points out that this priority "does not mean that
 the knowledge of being is to be replaced by the knowledge of man.
 Being still remains the essential, but man can approach it only through
 his existence as a man," i.e., through his historicity.8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following Edmund Husserl, who established the most widely adopted logical
 and epistemological platform for European or continental philosophy in
 this century, the problem of being has acquired and sustained a role of
 central importance.
 In order to avoid its gross misunderstanding it is necessary, especially
 from our Buddhist standpoint, to note that Husserl's basic postulate, "Back
 to the things themselves," does not in any way imply a substantialist meaning
 of "things" in the classical, physically oriented ontology or theory of
 being, which has been rejected by modern physics.
 The significance of "being" has been radically changed with the achievement
 of a deeper insight into both its physical and historical structure.
 This is revealed very clearly in the analysis of being by Nicolai Hartmann
 who, more than Husserl and his closer followers, concentrated on implications
 of the ontological problem in the natural sciences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this respect the standpoint of A.N.
 Whitehead in Anglo-American philosophy comes closest to that of N.
 Hartmann.
 Russell's theory of infinitesimal "space-time events" was not much more
 than an attempt to reduce to a pale rationalized scheme Whitehead's metaphysica
l conception of "actual occasions" and "throbbing actualities," understood
 as "pulsation of experience" whose "drops" or "puffs of existence" guided
 by an internal teleology in their "concrescence" (analogous to the Buddhist
 sa"nkaaraa in karmic formations) join the "stream of existence" (bhava"nga-soto
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of the abhidhammo conception of the "stream of existence" consists
 in its "theory of momentariness" kha.nika-vaado.
 Its modern analogy has found its first and best formulation in plain terms
 in the philosophy of William James, especially in his essay "Does 'Consciousnes
s' Exist?," where the "stream of consciousness" or "stream of thinking"
 (which, "when scrutinized, reveals itself to consist chiefly of the stream
 of my breathing") is elicited from his basic theory of "pure experience,"
 defined as "the instant field of the present...
 this succession of an emptiness and fullness that have reference to each
 other and are of one flesh" — succession "in small enough pulses," which
 "is the essence of the phenomenon." In the same connection, as "the result
 of our criticism of the absolute," the metaphysical and metapsychical idea
 of a "central self" is reduced by James to "the conscious self of the moment."9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The well-known Buddhist thesis of "no-self" (anattaa), or of a soul-less
 psychology, is based on the same background of the "theory of momentariness."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also one of the points — and the most significant one — on which
 the philosophical conception of James coincides with Bergson.
 Terminologically at least, Bergson's designation of the same "stream" as
 "flux du vecu," the word "vecu" ("lived") seems to come closest to the
 meaning of the Pali bhava"ngo, suggesting the "articulated" (a"ngo) texture
 of life-experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Husserl's interpretation, "things" are simply taken to mean "whatever
 is given," that which we "see" in consciousness, and this "given" is called
 phenomenal in the sense that it "appears" to our consciousness.
 The Greek word "phenomenon" does not necessarily indicate that there is
 an unknown thing behind phenomena (as in Kant's philosophy or in the Vedaanta),
 or a "back-stage" being, as Nietzsche ironically exposed it.
 From our standpoint, it is important to emphasize that Husserl's phenomenologic
al method "is neither deductive nor empirical, but consists in pointing
 to what is given and elucidating it."10 It claims, in other words, to be
 yathaa-bhuutam, or "adequate to [actual] being."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of the original meaning of the Greek term "phenomenon" has
 been performed in masterly fashion by Martin Heidegger.11 The word "phenomenon"
 (from the verb phainesthai, "let see," which is similar to the Pali ehi-passiko
) has two meanings relevant for philosophy.
 The first is "to show itself," the second, "to seem as." Contemporary phenomenol
ogical philosophy uses it in the first sense, as "merely letting something
 be seen, letting entities be perceived." The secondary meaning, indicating
 something which seems to "remain hidden, or which relapses or gets covered
 again, or shows itself only 'in disguise,'" points to the historical process
 of constructing theories and "views" (Greek doxa, Sanskrit dristi, Pali
 di.t.thi) by which the primordially "uncovered" phenomena are rather concealed
 again, or kept in disguise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same basic idea is adopted by Nicolai Hartmann: "That a being is 'in
 it-self' means to say that it exists actually and not only for us...
 Being-in-itself does not need to be proved, it is given as the world itself
 is given."12 Hartmann's most valuable contribution, however, is his entrance
 into the profound analysis of what was above called the secondary meaning
 of the philosophical term "phenomenon." His analysis distinguishes "spheres"
 and "levels" of being: Broadly, there are two primary spheres, designated
 as real and ideal being.
 In the sphere of the real, four structural levels are distinguished: matter,
 life, consciousness, and mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contexts eliciting such statements, it appears more and more obvious,
 from a Buddhist standpoint, how closely the meaning of the term phenomenon,
 as used in contemporary philosophy, approximates the basic meaning of dhamma
 in the abhidhamma theory.
 (The last instance quoted from Hartmann may remind us even more specifically
 of the khandhaa structures.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, beyond the possibility of extending this analogy of phenomenon
 as disclosure of "being-in-itself" understood as a process, it is felt
 more and more by several contemporary European philosophers (just as was
 the case in the original Buddhist counterpart) that the ontological purport
 of being, thus understood as phenomenon or dhammo, must still be limited
 by a critical principle of essentially deeper significance.
 This principle has found its first — and until now its clearest — logical
 formulation in the caatu-ko.tikam (tetralemma) rule by the Buddha, as he
 regularly applies it to the avyaakataani or "not-designated" problems,
 or "dialectical antinomies"13 of speculative thought: "Neither being, nor
 non-being, nor both being-and-non-being, nor neither-being-nor-non-being"
 can express the existential purport and content of human reality.
 The word "being," or any other derivate from the verb "to be," cannot adequatel
y express the immediate intuition (vipassanaa) of existence, or the essence
 of actuality (as paramattho).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This deficiency of the basic ontological term "being" has been subtly analyzed
 by Heidegger in his Introduction to Metaphysics.
 Yet with him the philosophy of existence (or human actuality) has taken
 a prevalently ontological direction (as a phenomenological analysis of
 being).
 It has become a philosophy of our human being-in-the-world, and consequently
 a philosophy of "anguish" or dukkham, even though it was soon felt that
 this ontological turning does not, and cannot, adequately reflect either
 the primordial motives or the ultimate scope of existential thinking.
 Without entering into the historical background of such inner divergences
 in contemporary philosophy, I should like to point out a few symptomatic
 objections which can be compared in their radically anti-ontological attitude
 with the principle of the Buddha as formulated above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the Buddha, the person reaping the fruits of good and bad actions
 (in a future life) is neither the same one who has committed these actions
 nor a different one.
 The same principle applies to the structural identification of a person
 in any other respect and circumstance, in the stream of one single physical
 life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The French philosopher Gabriel Marcel, discussing the problem of the structural
 unity of human personality, comes (at least on the basic level) to the
 conclusion that "the relation between my body and myself cannot be described
 as either 'being' or 'having': I am my body and yet I cannot identify myself
 with it."14 "Existing" does not mean being an object.
 On this supposition, Marcel develops his critical analysis of the two inadequat
e extreme terms of existence in his main work, Being and Having.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another representative of the same trend in French philosophy, Jean Wahl,
 seems to approximate more nearly the actual meaning of the Buddha's avyaakataan
i (specified above), not from formal logical or even linguistic considerations,
 but rather out of an essentially congenial understanding of the deeper
 problem: "We are concerned with questions which, strictly speaking, belong
 to solitary meditation and cannot be subjects of discourse."15
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicolas Berdyaev, an explicitly religious philosopher close to the same
 group, has given one of the clearest formulations of the point under discussion
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The problem which faces us is: Is being a product of objectification? Is
 not the concept of being concerned with being qua concept, does being possess
 existence at all?...
 Why is ontology impossible? Because it is always a knowledge of objectifying
 existence.
 In an ontology the idea of being is objectified and an objectification
 is already an existence which is alienated in the objectification.
 So that in ontology — in every ontology — existence vanishes...
 It is only in subjectivity that one may know existence, not in objectivity.
 In my opinion, the central idea has vanished in the ontology of Heidegger
 and Sartre."16
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In agreement with Dilthey's principle, quoted above, establishing the historical
 world-view of the cultural sciences independently from the scientific investiga
tion of essentially objective physical nature, Heidegger has limited his
 inquiry on "time as the horizon for all understanding of being." Against
 that background, he has criticized and abandoned the old substantialist
 ontology.
 For him, "temporality is the very being of human reality." The relation
 time-mind, as quoted above from Buddhaghosa's Atthasaalini, is for Heidegger
 also exhaustive for both terms.
 And yet Berdyaev, like the other anti-ontologist philosophers mentioned
 here, criticizes even this essential turning in contemporary "anthropological
 ontology," as at least a partial failure to understand authentic existential
 experience: "As a man Heidegger is deeply troubled by this world of care,
 fear, death, and daily dullness." Despite this, and beyond that sincerity,
 his philosophy "is not existential philosophy, and the depth of existence
 does not make itself felt in it."17
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for this was stated clearly and explicitly by Karl Jaspers, who
 was the first to criticize and abandon the ontological position in contemporary
 European philosophy, at the same time that Heidegger undertook his essential
 reform of its fundamental conception.
 In the view of Jaspers, "the ideal followed by ontologies is the perfectioning
 of the rational structure of the objectified world.
 Technical sciences have to help us bring about engineered existences." Jaspers
 was, from the very beginning of his philosophical critique (about 1930),
 extremely aware of the danger of such scientific technicalization of human
 existence: "As an attempt to bind us to objectified being, ontology sublates
 freedom." In his view, it is only "as potential existence that I am able
 to lift myself up from bondage.
 My chains will thus become the material of being..." The opposite way of an
 "engineered" civilization will transform me into a slave of that "material"
 and this actually is the typical form of suffering, of dukkham, by which
 "man in the modern age" is oppressed.18
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his advanced years, Jaspers has discovered the Buddhist philosopher Naagaarju
na as one of the most congenial minds,19 while Heidegger, when reading D.T.
 Suzuki's Essays on Zen Buddhism, confessed that this was exactly what he
 had tried to express all his life long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Six: It was doubt of the material substance of the world which, to a considerabl
e extent, provoked the problem of verifying the very idea of being, of the
 "selfhood" of the world, both in its exterior aspect and in that which
 is interior to the human being-in-the-world.
 What "doubt" was at the outset of critical philosophy in the period of
 its substantialist and objectifying orientation (following Descartes),
 disappointment, the "unsatisfactoriness" of the world, has become for the
 actual, subjectively oriented or introverted, humanistic philosophy of
 existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the best expressions of this turning can be found in some of the
 statements of Gabriel Marcel, who, by the way, defines his religious philosophy
 as a "doctrine of hope." Its basic postulate is that philosophy must be
 "transobjective, personal, dramatic, indeed tragic.
 'I am not witnessing a spectacle'; we should remind ourselves of this every
 day."20 The Buddhist implication of this basic attitude may be pursued still
 further in the earlier formulation by Kierkegaard: "Life is a masquerade...
 Your occupation consists in preserving your hiding place...
 In fact you are nothing; you are merely a relation to others, and what
 you are, you are by virtue of this relation...
 When the enchantment of illusion is broken, when existence begins to totter,
 then too does despair manifest itself as that which was at the bottom.
 Despair itself is a negativity, unconsciousness of it is a new negativity...
 This is the sickness unto death."21
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is only by abandoning the attitude of fascination for the "spectacle"
 of the statically staged "Being" of the world that man becomes sufficiently
 movable that he is fit to plunge into the stream of existence, no longer
 attached to some stage-prop or "remainder." Is only then that he can really
 start swimming along that stream of sa.msaaro, realizing that it is pure
 and simple aniccam or impermanent flux, and that he can eventually become
 aware of the advantage of "crossing" it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the point which contemporary European philosophy seems to be about
 to realize.
 It is essential for this realization that the principles of aniccam and
 dukkham be inseparably reconnected through the intuition of their immediate
 interaction.
 In the actual situation, it will no longer even be necessary to deduce
 explicitly the idea of anattaa as the dynamic resultant of the confrontation
 of the first two principles.
 Just like aniccam, anattaa has already become a truism for most Europeans,
 whom a standardized mental training, both scientific and philosophical
 has carried beyond the God and Soul dogma.22 The phantom of the Western
 version of a materialistic uccheda-vaado is likewise about to be dispelled.
 The critical missing link has only been between impermanence (aniccam)
 and suffering (dukkham).
 Due to the objectifying nature of scientific thinking, this link could
 never be revealed by a philosophy of nature subservient to science, not
 even of the type of Russell's popular literary criticism quoted above.
 It is obvious that only an existential experience of dukkham, suffering
 or "anguish," could bring about this realization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today we have to thank, for this realization, the catastrophic results and
 further consequences, still being suffered, of two world wars in the 20th
 century.
 That is why a new philosophy, already nascent on the eve of the Second
 World War, has emerged in Europe explicitly as a philosophy of conscience
 rather than of mere consciousness.
 It should appear equally obvious that in such a philosophy there is no
 longer any place for the stubborn false dilemma: philosophy or religion.
 This last problem, which concerns "philosophical faith," is more important
 for Buddhism than for any other religion.
 It has found its best diagnostical expression in several essays of Karl
 Jaspers, from which we extract a few hints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is questionable whether faith is possible without religion.
 Philosophy originates in this question...
 Man deprived of his faith by the loss of his religion is devoting more
 decisive thought to the nature of his own being...
 No longer does the revealed Deity upon whom all is dependent come first,
 and no longer the world that exists around us; what comes first is man,
 who, however, cannot make terms with himself as being, but strives to transcend
 himself...
 The unsheltered individual gives our epoch its physiognomy...
 [Formerly] the authority of the church sheltered him and sustained him,
 gave him peace and happiness...
 Today philosophy is the only refuge for those who, in full awareness, are
 not sheltered by religion.23
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, "faith" is here no longer understood as a belief in any revelation,
 but as reasonable trust in a qualified spiritual guide whose moral and
 intellectual capacities have to be carefully tested in each single case
 by a sound and mature criterion (apa.n.nako dhammo) such as was established
 by the Buddha in his critical discourses on religion, Apa.n.naka-suttam and
 Ca.nki-suttam (MN 60 and 95), in order to exclude empty and blind transmission
 of religious traditions "as a basket handed over from one to the other,"
 or in "a string of blind men." "One oneself is the guardian of oneself;
 what other guardian could there be?" (Dhp 160)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jean-Paul Sartre is another philosopher who, though himself not religious,
 realizes the tremendous importance of the religious problem from the bias
 of our critical age, and still more specifically from the bias of the deepest
 metaphysical implications of the idea of aniccam, as non-substantiality,
 undermining the scientific foundation of 19th century materialism: The
 tragic situation of human reality in the world consists in the fact that
 due to his karmic "freedom" man "is not what he is, man is what he is not."
 This statement, whose implications have scandalized many conservative Christian
 minds, nevertheless corresponds to the gist of St.
 Augustine's thought as rendered by Jaspers out of a different deeply religious
 concern with the undeniable facticity of the same existential situation:
 "I am myself, but I can fail myself.
 I must put my trust in myself, but I cannot rely on myself."24
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for Sartre, his first deduction from this basic realization of anicca-anattaa
 is that as such "man is a useless passion." "Human reality is the pure effort
 to become God without there being any given substratum for that effort...
 Desire expresses this endeavor...
 Fundamentally man is the desire to be." As such, he is always only a "project"
 — ceaselessly "catapulted" from the past to the future (as Ortega y Gasset
 has formulated it), without a natural possibility of finding poise in his
 own present.
 This is the tragedy of his "temporalization," whose ultimate meaning is
 aniccam.
 This is how "the existence of desire as a human fact is sufficient to prove
 that human reality is a lack." How, then, is a possibility of ultimate escape
 or "liberation" conceivable? It is because human reality "is a being such
 that in its being, its being is in question in the form of a project of
 being." On this basis only, "We can ascertain more exactly what is the being
 of the self: it is value."25
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He who wants to delve deeper into such possibilities, it would seem, should
 follow the advice of Gabriel Marcel or of Berdyaev, and try to cross beyond
 the possibilities expressed in any philosophy of being.
 The Buddhist fitting, or "raft," though considerably larger in its basic
 frame, is readily adaptable to their explicit requirements: "Neither being,
 nor non-being, nor both being-and-non-being, nor neither-being-nor-non-being."

A Walk in the Woods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Phra Khantipalo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Come with me for a walk in the woods.
 It is hot, silent, and nearly midday but there are patches of shade here
 and there where we may sit.
 Around us trees of forty years are only twenty feet high, so great is the
 struggle to survive.
 Many die young and never mature.
 You can see their young skeletons being relentlessly devoured by the termites.
 Taller trees are scattered here and there, battered survivors of a continuous
 fight for life.
 Many of their limbs have been torn off in sudden monsoon squalls, or else
 they have rotted away by fungus and disease and finally fallen off.
 You see that "sawdust" about this tree? Its top will soon fall as some
 grub is eating away its heartwood.
 Look over there at that young tree all askew — its roots have been attacked
 by some predator and so it has been blown over.
 And there, do you see that large tree, its bark covered with mud-plaster?
 The termites are under that gnawing away its green wood and when they succeed
 in ringing it all round then, in a single day, all its leaves will turn
 yellow and sixty years of growth comes to an end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above us, young leaves of translucent green match their brilliance against
 the startling blue sky.
 Even these young tender leaves are full of holes, delicacies for the great
 beetles that bumble about in the evening air.
 Lower down these trees, the more mature leaves are ragged and lend to the
 forest a threadbare look.
 Though they must be tough still it seems they are the food of some insect.
 Here and there you can see at the base of branches and round the lower
 parts of the trees yellow leaves hanging, stiffly awaiting, as it were,
 the executioner who will come as a breath of wind and bring them down.
 Parted, they are disjoined forever — one changing process from another
 changing process.
 They fall with a crash among the undergrowth.
 There they join hundreds of thousands which fell before them and litter
 all the ground with a crackly layer of decay.
 But they do not just decay slowly at their own speed.
 Their decay is quickened by a myriad of ants, termites, worms, and funguses,
 all ready for food and fighting to get it, a fearsome underground jungle
 in miniature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A bird calls and is still.
 Far away the bells on the necks of the water-buffalo at work in the rice-fields
 jingle.
 Insects drone by.
 You see, insects are always either looking for food or avoiding becoming
 the food of others.
 A breeze sways the trees and a huge round wasps' nest at the top of a slender
 sapling looks most insecure.
 Danger! Flies hum and buzz, perching on a bamboo swinging in constant motion.
 Cicadas tick, click, and whir far and near as though they were counting
 the seconds of their own — and everyone else's — lives.
 Seconds and minutes fly into days and months towards death.
 A ground lizard darts for its prey, catches it and chews the living insect
 with great relish.
 Another death in this round where death goes unremarked because it is everywher
e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ants swarm everywhere in lines, parties or armies, in all shapes and sizes,
 according to their species.
 They play a great part in the change of this forest for they are the scavengers.
 They have only to scent death and they will be there ready to undertake
 the dismemberment of the corpse.
 Sometimes it is still alive.
 No decay is uninteresting to them, it is their livelihood and they are
 always busy for beings never cease decaying and dying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spiders too are found in great variety, all of them ready to pounce on and
 bite to death unwary small creatures that become entangled in their shimmering
 webs.
 They hang them, iridescent in the sunlight everywhere and it is a wonder
 that anything can fly and yet escape them.
 But even spiders do not escape death, usually from the stings of their
 enemies, the hunting wasps.
 Though the swaying bough of bamboo is most graceful it has been marked
 as part of this menacing world by a spider's web hung among its leaves.
 And bamboos are cut down by men for their usefulness.
 Everything, the beautiful and the ugly is subject to impermanence.
\end_layout

Clouds pass across the sky bringing coolness to us here below.

Look over here in the forest, a pile of ashes and a few burnt-out logs rotting
 away, and look: here is another older heap nearly dispersed.
 And other piles are round about with occasional carved wooden posts set
 in the ground, all smoldering.
 What are they? These mark the ends of men and women.
 This forest at the back of the Wat1 is used for cremation.
 Some days, if you go in the late afternoon you will find a group of villagers,
 and a very simple open-topped coffin.
 Everyone can see the body there clothed as he or she died and looking,
 as corpses do unless interfered with, quite repulsive.
 The day of cremation is the day on which the person died, or the very next
 day at the latest.
 Change sets in fast and hideously in a body kept in the hot countries.
 A big pile of logs has been made and without ceremony and with no pretentious
 solemnity the coffin is hoisted on top.
 Bhikkhus having viewed the corpse are then asked to chant and some gifts
 are given and dedicated for the good of the dead man.
 Then without more ado paraffin is splashed over the pile and it is set
 alight.
 Some stay to see it burn.
 You can soon see the body roasting through the flames when the thin-walled
 coffin has burnt out...
 until amidst the embers there are only some charred pieces of bone...

Now the sun, "the eye of the day," has changed his position, or we have
 changed ours and our short walk in the woods is nearly over.
 What have we seen that does not pass away? Even though I may say that I
 look out of the windows of my hut every day and see the same trees, how
 near to truth is this? How can the trees be the same? They are steadily
 changing they are unstable and certain to come to an end in one way or
 another.
 They have had a beginning and they must have an end.

\begin_layout Standard
And what about this "I" who sees these trees, the forest, the burning ground
 and so on? Permanent or impermanent? Everyone can answer this question,
 for we have seen the answer in the forest.
 When "I" feel depressed and look at the trees they seem stark, ugly moth-eaten
 specimens.
 But when "I" am glad and look upon them, see, how beautiful they are! If,
 while on our walk, we looked only at the impermanence "out there," now
 is the time to bring the lesson home to the heart.
 Everything that I am is impermanent, unstable, sure to change and deteriorate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If impermanence meant change all the time towards better and happier states
 how excellent our world would be! But impermanence is allied with deterioration.
 All compounds break down, all made things fall to pieces, all conditioned
 things pass away with the passing of those conditions.
 Everything and everybody — that includes you and me — deteriorates, ages,
 decays, breaks up, and passes away.
 And we, living in the forest of desires, are entirely composed of the impermane
nt.
 Yet our desire impels us not to see this, though impermanence stares us
 in the face from every single thing around.
 And it confronts us when we look within — mind and body, arising and passing
 away.

The Buddhist Doctrine of Anicca (Impermanence)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Y.
 Karunadasa, Ph.D.
 (London)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddhist doctrine of anicca, the transitoriness of all phenomena, finds
 classical expression in the oft-recurrent formula: Sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa,
 and in the more popular statement: Aniccaa vata sankhaaraa.
 Both these formulas amount to saying that all conditioned things or phenomenal
 processes, mental as well as material, that go to make up the sa.msaaric
 plane of existence are transient or impermanent.
 This law of impermanence is not the result of any kind of metaphysical
 inquiry or of any mystical intuition.
 It is a straightforward judgment arrived at by investigation and analysis,
 and as such its basis is entirely empirical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is in fact for the purpose of showing the insubstantiality and impermanence
 of the world of experience that Buddhism analyzes it into a multiplicity
 of basic factors.
 The earliest attempts at explaining this situation are represented in the
 analysis into five khandas, twelve aayatanas, and eighteen dhaatus.
 In the Abhidhamma we get the most detailed analysis into eighty one basic
 elements, which are introduced by the technical term, dhammaa.
 These are the basic factors into which the empiric individuality in relation
 to the external world is ultimately analyzed.
 They purport to show that there does not exist a "unity," "substance,"
 "atta," or "jiiva." In the ultimate analysis the so-called unity is a complex
 of factors, "one" is really "many." This applies to both mind and matter
 equally.
 In the case of living beings there is no soul or self which is immortal,
 while in the case of things in general there is no essence which is ever-perdur
ing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These basic factors, according to Buddhism, do not imply an absolute unity
 (ekatta).
 They are not fractions of a whole, but a number of co-ordinate ultimates.
 Although real they are not permanent.
 Nor are they mutually unconnected.
 As such they do not imply a theory of absolute separateness (puthutta)
 either.
 A good example of this kind of world-view is that of Pakudha Kaccaayana,
 who seeks to explain the composition of the world with reference to seven
 eternally existing and mutually unconnected substances.
 This reduces the world to a concatenation of separate and discrete entities,
 with no inter-connection, with no inter-dependence.
 The Buddhist view of existence does not amount to such an extreme, for
 according to Buddhism the basic factors are inter-connected with laws of
 causation and conditionality.
 Thus the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is based both on analysis and
 synthesis.
 It is through analysis that the empirical world is reduced to a multiplicity
 of basic factors, and it is through causality that they are again synthesized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That existence does not consist of an eternal substance, mental or material,
 but is composed of a variety of constantly changing factors is the conclusion
 that can be drawn from the analysis into khandhas, aayatanas, dhaatus,
 and dhammas.
 On the impermanence of the five khandhas that make up the empiric individuality
, we find this statement in the Sa.myuttanikaaya: "There is no materiality
 whatever, O monks, no feeling, no perception, no formations, no consciousness
 whatever that is permanent, ever-lasting, eternal, changeless, identically
 abiding for ever." Then the Blessed One took a bit of cowdung in his hand
 and he spoke to the monks: "Monks, if even that much of permanent, ever-lasting
, eternal, changeless individual selfhood [attabhaava], identically abiding
 for ever, could be found, then this living of a life of purity [brahmacariya]
 for the complete eradication of Ill [dukkhakkhaya] would not be feasible"
 (SN 22.96).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is revolutionary about the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is that
 it is extended to include everything, including consciousness, which is
 usually taken to be permanent, as the soul or as one of its qualities.
 The Majjhima Nikaaya records how Bhikkhu Saati misunderstood Buddha's teaching
 to mean that consciousness is a permanent entity, which passes from one
 existence to another, like the niraasraya vi~n~naana of the Upanisads.
 This led the Buddha to formulate the well-known principle: A~n~natra paccayaa
 natthi vi~n~naanassa sambhavo — There is no arising of consciousness without
 reference to a condition.
 This is further explained to mean that consciousness comes into being (sambhoti
) in dependence on a duality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is that duality? It is eye, which is impermanent, changing, becoming-other,
 and visible objects, which are impermanent, changing, and becoming-other:
 such is the transient, fugitive duality [of eye-cum-visible objects], which
 is impermanent, changing, and becoming-other.
 Eye-consciousness too is impermanent.
 For how could eye-consciousness arisen by depending on an impermanent condition
 be permanent? The coincidence, concurrence, and confluence of these three
 factors which is called contact and those other mental phenomena arising
 as a result are also impermanent.
 (The same formula is applied to the other sense-organs and the consciousnesses
 named after them.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 35.93
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is in view of the impermanence and insubstantiality of consciousness
 that Buddha has declared:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Better were it bhikkhus that the uneducated many-folk should conceive this
 four-element-made body, rather than citta, to be soul.
 And why? The body is seen to persist for a year, for two, three, four,
 five, ten or twenty years, for a generation, even for a hundred years or
 even for longer, while that which is called consciousness, that is mind,
 that is intelligence, arises as one thing, ceases as another, both by day
 and night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 12.61
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of its acceptance of this law of universal impermanence, Buddhism
 stands in direct opposition to sassatavaada or eternalism, which usually
 goes hand in hand with aatmavaada, i.e., belief in some kind of immortal
 soul.
 The Brahmajaala Sutta of the Diighanikaaya alone refers to more than ten
 varieties of eternalism, only to refute them as misconceptions of the true
 nature of the empirical world.
 But this refutation of eternalism does not lead to the acceptance, on the
 part of Buddhism, of the other extreme, namely ucchedavaada or annihilationism,
 which usually goes hand in hand with materialism.
 The Buddhist refutation of both these extremes finds classical expression
 in the following words of the Buddha:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This world, O Kaccaayana, generally proceeds on a duality, of the "it is"
 and the "it is not." But, O Kaccaayana, whoever perceives in truth and wisdom
 how things originate in the world, for him there is no "it is not" in this
 world.
 Whoever, Kaccaayana, perceives in truth and wisdom how things pass away
 in the world, for him there is no "it is" in this world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 12.15
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This statement of the Buddha refers to the duality (dvayataa) of existence
 (atthitaa) and non-existence (natthitaa).
 These are the two theories of eternalism and annihilationism which find
 expression in many forms in various types of religion and philosophy.
 The former implies belief in a permanent and changeless substance or entity,
 whether it is conceived as a plurality of individual souls as in Jainism,
 or as a monistic world-soul as in Vedaanta, or as a deity of some kind
 as in most of the theistic religions.
 The latter, on the other hand, implies a belief in the temporary existence
 of separate souls or personalities which are entirely destroyed or dissolved
 after death.
 A good example of this kind of philosophy is the one advocated by Ajita
 Kesakambali which finds mention in the Saama~n~naphala Sutta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, according to Buddhism, everything is the product of antecedent
 causes and therefore of dependent origination (pa.ticca-samuppanna).
 These causes themselves are not ever-lasting and static, but simply antecedent
 aspects of the same ceaseless becoming.
 Every event is the result of a concatenation of dynamic processes (sankhaara).
 Neither Being nor non-Being is the truth.
 There is only Becoming, happening by way of cause, continuity without identity,
 persistence without a persistent substance.
 "He who discerns origin by way of cause he discerns the Dhamma, he who
 discerns the Dhamma he discerns origin by way of cause."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus by accepting the theory of causation and conditionality, Buddhism avoids
 the two extremes of sabba.m atthi (everything is) and sabba.m natthi (everything
 is not) and advocates sabba.m bhavati, "everything becomes," i.e., happens
 by way of cause and effect.
 It is also because of this theory that Buddhism could avoid the two extremes
 of niyativaada (determinism) and ahetu-appaccaya-vaada (indeterminism).
 According to the former everything is absolutely pre-determined, according
 to the latter everything happens without reference to any cause or condition.
 According to both there is no room for free will and as such moral responsibili
ty gets completely ruled out.
 By its theory of causation Buddhism avoids both extremes and establishes
 free will and moral responsibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second basic characteristic of the world of experience, namely dukkha
 (unsatisfactoriness) is but a logical corollary arising from this law of
 universal impermanence.
 For the impermanent nature of everything can but lead to one inescapable
 conclusion: As everything is impermanent, they cannot be made the basis
 of permanent happiness.
 Whatever is transient is by that very fact unsatisfactory — yad anicca.m
 ta.m dukkha.m.
 Since every form of sa.msaaric existence is impermanent, it is also characterize
d by unsatisfactoriness.
 Thus the premise: "sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa" leads to the conclusion: "sabbe
 sankhaaraa dukkhaa."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As indicative of a general characteristic of phenomena, the term dukkha
 should not be understood in a narrower sense to mean only pain, suffering,
 misery, or sorrow.
 As a philosophical term it has a wider connotation, as wide as that of
 the term anicca.
 In this wider sense, it includes deeper ideas such as imperfection, unrest,
 conflict, in short, unsatisfactoriness.
 This is precisely why even the states of jhaana, resulting from the practice
 of higher meditation and which free from suffering as ordinarily understood,
 are also included in dukkha.
 This is also why the characterization dukkha is extended even to matter
 (ruupa).
 The Visuddhi-magga of Buddhaghosa recognizes these wider implications of
 the term when it explains it as three-fold, namely dukkha-dukkha (dukkha
 as suffering), vipari.naama-dukkha (dukkha as change), and sankhaara-dukkha
 (dukkha as conditioned state).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a direct and necessary corollary of this fact of dukkha, we come to the
 third basic characteristic of all phenomena, namely anatta, which finds
 expression in the well-known statement: Sabbe dhammaa anattaa.
 For the unsatisfactory nature of everything should lead to this important
 conclusion: If everything is characterized by unsatisfactoriness, nothing
 can be identified as the self or as a permanent soul (attaa).
 What is dukkha (by that very fact) is also anatta.
 What is not the self cannot be considered as I am (ahan ti), as mine (maman
 ti), or as I am that (asmii ti).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Buddhism the idea of self or soul is not only a false and imaginary
 belief, with no corresponding objective reality, but is also harmful from
 an ethical point of view.
 For it produces such harmful thoughts of I, me, and mine, selfish desires,
 attachments, and all other unwholesome states of mind (akusalaa dhammaa).
 It could also be a misery in disguise to one who accepts it as true:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Do you see, O bhikkhus, such a soul-theory in the acceptance of which,
 there would not arise grief, lamentation, suffering, distress, and tribulation?
"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Certainly not, Sir."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Good, O bhikkhus, I too, O bhikkhus, do not see a soul-theory, in the acceptanc
e of which there would not arise grief, lamentation, suffering, distress,
 and tribulation."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— MN 22
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This brings into relief the close connection between the Buddhist doctrine
 of impermanence and Buddhist ethics: If the world of experience is impermanent,
 by that very fact it cannot be made the basis of permanent happiness.
 What is not permanent (anicca) and therefore what is characterized by unsatisfa
ctoriness (dukkha) cannot be considered as the self (anatta).
 And what is not the self (atta) cannot be considered as one's own (saka)
 or as a haven of security (taa.na).
 For the things that one gets attached to are constantly changing.
 Hence attachment to them would only lead to unrest and sorrow.
 But when one knows things as they truly are (yathaabhuuta.m), i.e., as anicca,
 dukkha, and anatta, one ceases to get agitated by them, one ceases to take
 refuge in them.
 Just as attachment to things is to get fettered by them, even so detachment
 from them is to get freed from them.
 Thus in the context of Buddhist ethics, the perception of impermanence
 is only a preliminary step to the eradication of all cravings, which in
 turn has the attainment of Nibbaana as its final goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will thus be seen that the Buddhist doctrine of anicca, on which is also
 based the doctrine of dukkha and anatta, can rightly be called the very
 foundation of the whole edifice of Buddhist philosophy and ethics.
 This explains why the Buddha has declared that the very perception of this
 fact, namely that whatever comes into existence is also subject to dissolution
 (ya.m ki~nci samudaya-dhamma.m sabba.m ta.m nirodhadhamma.m) is indeed the very
 arising of the stainless Eye of the Doctrine (dhamma-cakkhu).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Theory of Momentariness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddhist doctrine of impermanence, as explained in the canonical texts,
 does really amount to a theory of momentariness, in the sense that everything
 is in a state of constant flux.
 This becomes clear from a passage in the Anguttara Nikaaya (AN 3.47), where
 the three sankhata-lakkha.nas (the characteristics of that which is compounded)
 are explained.
 Here it is said that that which is sankhata (compounded) has three fundamental
 characteristics, namely uppaada (origination), vaya (dissolution), and
 .thitassa a~n~nathatta (otherwiseness of that which is existing).
 From this it follows that the Buddhist doctrine of change should not be
 understood in the ordinary sense that something arises, exists for some
 time in a more or less static form, and dissolves.
 On the contrary, the third characteristic, i.e., .thitassa a~n~nathatta shows
 that between its arising and cessation, a thing is all the time changing,
 with no static phase in between.
 Thus the Buddhist doctrine of change does really amount to a theory of
 universal flux.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as the application of this theory of change is concerned, there is
 nothing to suggest that early Buddhism had made any distinction between
 mind and matter.
 However, some schools of Buddhism, notably the Mahaasaanghikas, Vaatsiiputriyas
, and Sammitiiyas, while recognizing the momentary duration of mental elements,
 assigned a relative permanence to matter.
 Others, such as the Sarvaastivaadins, Mahiisaasakas, and Sautraantikas
 objected to introducing any such distinction and declared that all elements
 of existence, mental as well as material, are of momentary duration, of
 instantaneous being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Theory of Moment (ksa.na-vaada)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the various schools of Buddhism the early Buddhist doctrine of change
 came to be explained on the basis of a formulated theory of moments.
 This theory is based on the three sankhata-lakkha.nas which we referred
 to earlier.
 It is in fact on the interpretation of the third sankhata-lakkha.na, namely
 .thitassa a~n~nathatta that the different schools of Buddhism differ widely,
 as if to justify the very meaning conveyed by these two words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Vaibhaasika School of Buddhism interpret sthityanyathaatva (= .thitassa
 a~n~nathatta) as jarataa, postulate another characteristic called sthiti,
 and thus increase the number of sankhata-lakkha.nas to four: (i) jaati (originat
ion), (ii) sthitii (existence), (iii) jarataa (decay), (iv) anityataa (extinctio
n).
 All elements, mental as well as material, characterised by them are sa.mskrta
 (= sankhata).
 Only aakaasa (space) and Nirvaana escape from their inexorable sway.
 At every moment (ksa.na) all mental and material elements are affected by
 them.
 A moment is defined as the time during which the four characteristics accomplis
h their operation.
 The Vaibhaasikas also maintain that these characteristics are not only
 distinct from, but also as real as the things which they characterize —
 showing thereby a strong predilection to naive realism.
 And in keeping with this theory, it is also claimed that they are in turn
 characterized by secondary characteristics (anulaksa.nas).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Sautraantika School of Buddhism does not agree with this interpretation
 of the Vaibhaasikas.
 In their view, the four characteristics apply not to one but to a series
 of momentary elements: "The series itself is called sthiti (subsistence),
 its origin is called jaati, its cessation is vyaya, and the difference
 in its preceding and succeeding moments is called sthityanyathaatva" (Abhidharm
akosa, III, 78).
 A momentary element, so they argue, cannot have a phase called sthiti or
 jarataa, for whatever that originates has no time to subsist or decay but
 to perish.
 They also point out that these four characteristics are mere designations
 with no objective reality.
 They criticize the recognition of secondary characteristics on the ground
 that this would lead to the fallacy of infinite regress (anavasthaa).
 For if the four characteristics require a set of secondary characteristics
 to account for their origination, etc., then these secondary characteristics
 will in turn require another set of secondary characteristics to account
 for their origination, etc., and in this manner the process could be stretched
 indefinitely.
 This problem does not arise — so runs the argument — if the characteristics
 are not recognized as real as the things they characterize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How the Theravaadins developed the doctrine of impermanence, and how they
 interpreted the sankhata-lakkha.nas could be understood clearly when the
 subject is unfolded against this background.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most striking feature of the Theravada theory is that the fact of momentarin
ess is explained in quite a different way: Each dhamma (element of existence)
 has three moments, namely uppaadakkha.na, the moment of origination; .thitikkha.na
, the moment of subsistence; and bhangakkha.na, the moment of cessation.
 These three moments do not correspond to three different dhammas.
 On the contrary, they represent three phases — the nascent, the static,
 and cessant — of one "momentary" dhamma.
 Hence the statement that dhammas are momentary means that a given dhamma
 has three momentary phases or stages.
 It arises in the first moment, subsists in the second moment, and perishes
 in the third moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the Sautraantikas, the Theravaadins too accept the fact that a momentary
 dhamma has no phase called jarataa or decay.
 According to the argument of both schools, the attribution of jarataa,
 which implies some kind of change or transformation, to a momentary dhamma
 is to accept pari.naamavaada, according to which the essence, the substance
 remains the same while its modes undergo change.
 Change, as it came to be finally defined in the schools of Buddhist logic,
 is not the transformation of one and the same dhamma from one stage to
 another, but the replacement of one momentary dhamma by another.
 The following argument in the Abhidharmakosa, which is directed against
 the Vaibhaasikas who admit jarataa of one momentary dhamma, clarifies this
 situation: "But how can you speak of jarataa or change in respect of one
 momentary dhamma? What is called jarataa or change is the transformation
 or dissimilarity between two stages.
 Is it possible to say that a dharma becomes different from itself.
 If it remains unchanged it cannot be another.
 If it is transformed it is not the same.
 Therefore the transformation of one dhamma is not possible" (Abhidharmakosa,
 III, 56).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence the Sautraantikas and the Theravaadins apply the characteristic of
 jarataa only to a series of momentary dhammas.
 In their opinion what is called jarataa is the difference between the preceding
 and the succeeding moments of a series.
 There is, however, this difference to be noted: Unlike the Sautraantikas,
 the Theravaadins do not deny the static phase (.thiti) of a momentary dhamma.
 The Theravada argument in support of their accepting the static phase is
 as follows: It is true that a dhamma that originates should also cease
 to exist.
 But before it could cease to exist, there should be at least a moment when
 it turns towards its own cessation (nirodhaabhimukhaavatthaa).
 It is this moment when a dhamma is facing its own cessation that we call
 the static phase.
 The logic of this argument is that a dhamma that arises cannot cease to
 exist at the same time, for otherwise existence and non-existence would
 become co-existent!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One logical development of this theory of moments is the denial of motion.
 For, if all the elements of existence are of momentary duration, they have
 no time to move.
 In the case of momentary elements, wherever appearance takes place there
 itself takes place disappearance (yatraivotpattih tatraiva vinaasah).
 In keeping with this theory, motion is given a new definition.
 According to this definition, motion has to be understood, not as the movement
 of one material element from one locus in space to another (desaantara-sa.mkraan
t), but as the appearance of momentary elements in adjacent locations (desaantar
otpatti), creating a false picture of movement.
 The best example given in this case is the light of the lamp.
 The so-called light of the lamp, it is argued, is nothing but a common
 designation given to an uninterrupted production of a series of flashing
 points.
 When the production changes place one says that the light has changed.
 But in reality other flames have appeared in another place.

Anicca (Impermanence) According to Theravada
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the Theravada, anicca is the first of what are often called
 in Buddhist literature the "Three Characteristics" (ti-lakkha.na) or the
 "General Characteristics" (saama~n~na-lakkha.na).
 Anicca is usually treated as the basis for the other two, though anattaa,
 the third, is sometimes founded on dukkha alone.

\begin_layout Standard
The normal English equivalent for anicca is "impermanent."

\begin_layout Standard
Derivations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adjective anicca (impermanent) is derived in modern etymology from the
 negative prefix a- plus nicca (permanent: cf.
 Vedic Sanskrit nitya from prefix ni- meaning "onward, downward").
 The Paramatthama~njuusaa (commentary to the Visuddhimagga) and also the
 Poraana-Tiikaa (one of the three commentaries to the Abhidhammatthasa"ngaha)
 agree that "Because it denies everlastingness, it is not permanent, thus
 it is impermanent" (na niccan ti anicca.m: VisA.
 125).
 The Vibhaavinii-Tikaa and Sankhepava.n.nanaa (the other two commentaries
 to the Abhs.) prefer a derivation from the negative prefix an- plus root
 i to go: "Cannot be gone to, is un-approachable, as a permanent, everlasting
 state, thus it is impermanent" (...
 na iccam, anupagantabban ti aniccam).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Principal definitions given in the Sutta Pi.taka are as follows.
 "'Impermanent, impermanent' it is said, Lord.
 What is impermanent?" — "Materiality [ruupa] is impermanent, Raadha, and
 so are feeling [vedanaa] and perception [sa~n~naa] and formations [sankhaara]
 and consciousness [vi~n~naa.na]" (SN 23.1).
 This statement is summarized by a Canonical commentary thus: "What is impermane
nt? The five categories [khandha] are impermanent.
 In what sense impermanent? Impermanent in the sense of rise and fall [udaya-vay
a]" (Ps.
 Aanaapaanakathaa/vol.
 i, 230).
 Again, "All is impermanent.
 And what is the all that is impermanent? The eye is impermanent, visual
 objects [ruupaa]...
 eye-consciousness...
 eye contact [cakku-samphassa]...
 whatever is felt [vedayita] as pleasant or unpleasant or neither-unpleasant-nor
-pleasant, born of eye-contact is impermanent.
 [Likewise with the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind]" (SN 35.43/vol.
 iv, 28) or, quite succinctly, "All formations are impermanent" (MN 35/vol.
 i, 230) and "Whatever is subject to origination [samudaya] is subject to
 cessation [nirodha]" (MN 56/vol.
 i, 380).
 The Canonical commentary adds "Materiality [etc.] is impermanent in the
 sense of exhaustion [khaya]" (Ps.
 ~Naa.nakathaa/vol.
 i, 37).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For reasons given below, impermanence in strict Abhidhamma treatment appears,
 along with continuity (santati), etc., only as one of the secondary (derivative)
 constituents of the materiality category (see e.g., Dhs.
 & 645), of which the commentary says "Impermanence of materiality has the
 characteristic of complete break-up.
 Its nature is to make instances of materiality subside.
 It is manifested as their exhaustion and fall.
 Its footing is materiality that is completely breaking up" (Vis.
 Ch.
 XIV/p.450).
 A section of the Vibha"nga, however, which does not follow the strict Abhidhamm
a method, extends impermanence to the highest kinds of heavenly existence,
 beyond those with fine-materiality (ruupa) to the immaterial (aruupa) where
 there is perception only of infinity of space, infinity of consciousness,
 nothingness, or reduced perception of nothingness (Dhammahadaya-Vibha"nga).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa elaborate the Sutta definitions
 further, distinguishing between "the impermanent and the characteristic
 of impermanence.
 The five categories are the impermanent.
 Why? Because their essence is to rise and fall and change, and because,
 after having been, they are not.
 But the characteristic of impermanence is their state of rise and fall
 and alternation, or it is their mode-transformation [aakaara-vikaara] called

 Ch.
 XXI/p.
 640); again "The eye [etc.,] can be known as impermanent in the sense of
 its non-being after having been; and it is impermanent for four reasons
 as well; because it has rise and fall, because it changes, because it is
 temporary, and because it denies permanence" (VbhA.
 41; cf.
 MA.
 ad, MN 22/vol.
 ii, 113), and "Since its destiny is non-being and since it abandons its
 natural essence because of the transmission [of personal continuity] to
 a new state of being [on rebirth], it is 'subject to change,' which is
 simply synonymous with its impermanence" (VbhA.
 49).

Treatment in the Suttas and Commentaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having dealt with derivations and definitions, we can now turn to the Suttas
 and commentaries again in order to see how this subject is handled there;
 for in this article we shall be mainly concerned with quotations, leaving
 discussion to other articles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But at this point, it is convenient to approach the doctrine of impermanence
 first from the point of view of it as a description of what actually is
 (yathaa-bhuuta), leaving till later the point of view of it as a basis
 for evaluation and judgment, which is the reason and justification for
 the description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Impermanence is observable empirically and is objectively and publicly evident,
 always if looked for, and from time to time forcing itself upon our notice.
 Externally it is found in the inconstancy of "things," which extends even
 to the periodical description of world-systems (see e.g., MN 28; SN 15.20;
 AN 7.62); and in one self it can be observed, for instance, in the body's
 inadequacy (aadiinava) because it ages, is prone to sickness, dies, and
 gradually decays after death (see MN 13); life is short (AN 7.70).
 But "it would be better for an untaught ordinary man to treat as self [attaa]
 this body, which is constructed upon the four great entities [mahaa-bhuuta],
 then cognizance [citta].
 Why? Because this body can last one year, two years,...
 even a hundred years; but what is called 'cognizance' and 'mind' [mano]
 and 'consciousness' [vi~n~naa.na] rises and ceases differently through night
 and day, just as a monkey ranging through a forest seizes a branch, and,
 letting that go, seizes another" (SN 12.61/vol.
 ii, 94.5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless observance of empirical impermanence might not alone suffice
 for the radical position accorded by the Buddha to this characteristic.
 This is established, however, by discovery, through reasoned attention,
 of a regular structure in the subjective-objective process of its occurrence:
 "This body [for example] is impermanent, it is formed [sa.nkhata], and it
 is dependently-arisen [pa.ticca-samuppanna]" (SN 36.7/vol.
 iv, 211; cf.
 SN 22.21/vol.
 iii, 24).
 Here, in fact, three aspects are distinguished, three necessary and interlockin
g constituents of impermanence, namely (1) change, (2) formation (as "this,
 not that," without which no change could be perceived), and (3) a recognizable
 pattern in a changing process (also called "specific conditionality" (idapaccay
ataa), which pattern is set out in the formula of dependent origination
 (pa.ticca-samuppaada).
 We shall take these three aspects in order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no single treatise on the characteristic of impermanence either
 in the Tipi.taka or its commentaries, and so we shall have to bring together
 passages from a number of sources.
 We may also bear in mind that the Buddha does not confine descriptions
 of a general nature such as this to the observed alone, but extends them
 to include the observer, regarded as actively committed in the world he
 observes and acting on it as it acts on him, so long as craving and ignorance
 remain unabolished.
 "That in the world by which one perceives the world [loka-sa~n~nii] and
 conceives concepts about the world [loka-maanii] is called 'the world'
 in the Ariyas's Discipline.
 And what is it in the world with which one does that? It is with the eye,
 ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind" (SN 35.116/vol.
 iv, 95).
 That same world "is being worn away [lujjhati], that is why it is called
 'world' [loka]" (SN 35.82/vol.
 iv, 52).
 That impermanence is not only appropriate to all of any arisen situation
 but also to the totality of all arisen situations:

Then the Blessed One took a small piece of cowdung in his hand he told the
 bhikkhu: "Bhikkhu, if even that much of permanent, everlasting, eternal
 individual selfhood [attabhaava], not subject to change could be found,

\begin_layout Standard
This leads us to the second of the three aspects, that of the formation
 mentioned above; for to be impermanent is to have a beginning and an end,
 to have rise and fall.
 "Bhikkhus, there are three formed characteristics of the formed: arising
 is evident and fall is evident and the alteration of what is present [.thitassa
 a~n~nathattam] is evident" (AN 3.47/vol.
 i, 152).
 And one who possesses the Five Factors of Endeavor [padhaaniya"nga] "has
 understanding, possesses understanding [pa~n~naa] extending to rise and
 disappearance" (DN 33/ vol.
 iii, 237).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acariya Buddhaghosa makes use of the empirically observable in order to
 arrive at the radical concept of rise and fall.
 A cup gets broken (VbhA.
 49); the asoka tree's shoot can be seen to change in the course of a few
 days from pale to dark red and then through brown to green leaves, which
 eventually turn yellow, wither, and fall to the ground (Vis.
 Ch.
 xx/p.
 625).
 The illustration of a lighted lamp is also used; where it goes to when
 its oil and wick are used up no one knows...
 But that is crudely put; for the flame in each third portion of the wick
 as it gradually burns away ceases there without reaching the other parts...
 That is crudely put too; for the flame in each inch, in each half-inch,
 in each thread, in each strand, will cease without reaching the other strands;
 but no flame can appear without a strand (Vis.
 Ch.
 xx/p.
 622).
 By regarding seeming stability in ever shorter periods and minuter detail,
 a momentary view is arrived at.
 Anything whatever, first analyzed into a five-category situation, is then
 regarded as arising anew in each moment (kha.na) and immediately dissolving,
 "like sesamum seeds crackling when put into a hot pan" (Vis.
 Ch.
 xx/pp.
 622, 626).
 This is further developed in the commentary to the Visuddhimagga:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formed [sa"nkhata] dhammas' arising by means of cause and condition, their
 coming to be after not being, their acquisition of individuality [attabhaava],
 is their rise.
 Their instantaneous cessation and exhaustion when arisen is their fall.
 Their other state through aging is their alteration.
 For just as when the occasion [avatthaa] of arising dissolves and the occasion
 of dissolution [bha"nga] succeeds it, there is no break in the basis [vatthu]
 on the occasion facing dissolution, in other words, presence [.thiti], which
 is what the term of common usage 'aging' refers to, so too it is necessary
 that the aging of a single dhamma is meant, which is what is called 'momentary
 [instantaneous] aging.' And there must, without reservation, be no break
 in the basis between the occasions of arising and dissolution, otherwise
 it follows that one [thing] arises and another dissolves.

\begin_layout Standard
Acariya Buddhaghosa, though not identifying being with being-perceived rejects
 the notion of any underlying substance — any hypostasis, personal or impersonal
 — thus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[One contemplating rise and fall] understands that there is no heap or store
 of unarisen mentality-materiality [naama-ruupa] [existing] prior to its
 arising.
 When it arises, it does not come from any heap or store; and when it ceases,
 it does not go in any direction.
 There is nowhere any depository in the way of a heap or store, prior to
 its arising, of the sound that arises when a lute is played, nor does it
 come from any store when it arises, nor does it go in any direction when
 it has ceased [cf.
 SN 35.205/vol.
 iv, 197], but on the contrary, not having been, it is brought into being
 by depending on the lute, the lute's soundboard, and a man's appropriate
 effort, and immaterial [aruupa] dhammas come to be [with the aid of specific
 conditions], and having been, they vanish.

The transience and perpetual renewal of dhammas is compared in the same

 807), a whirling firebrand's circle (alaata cakka), a goblin city (gandhabba-na
gara), froth (Dhp 46), a plantain trunk (SN 22.95/vol.
 iii, 141), and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before leaving the aspect of rise and fall, the question of the extent (addhaana
) of the moment (kha.na), as conceived in the commentaries, must be examined
 (The Abhidhamma mentions the kha.na without specifying any duration).
 A Sutta cited above gave "arising, fall, and alteration of what is present"
 as three characteristics of anything formed.
 In the commentaries this is restated as "rise, presence, and dissolution"
 (uppaada-.thiti-bha"nga; see e.g., Vis.
 Ch.
 xx/p.
 615), which are each also called "[sub-] moments" (kha.na).
 These sub-moments are discussed in the Vibha"nga commentary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To what extent does materiality last? And to what extent the [mental] immaterial
? Materiality is heavy to change and slow to cease; the immaterial is light
 to change and quick to cease.
 Sixteen cognizances arise and cease while [one instance of] materiality
 lasts; but that ceases with the seventeenth cognizance.
 It is like when a man wanting to knock down some fruit hits a branch with
 a mallet, and when fruits and leaves are loosed from their stems simultaneously
; and of those the fruits fall first to the ground because they are heavier,
 the leaves later because they are lighter.
 So too, just as the leaves and fruits are loosed simultaneously from their
 stems with the blow of the mallet, there is simultaneous manifestation
 of materiality and immaterial dhammas at the moment of relinking [pa.tisandhi]
 at rebirth...
 And although there is this difference between them, materiality cannot
 occur without the immaterial nor can the immaterial without materiality:
 they are commensurate.
 Here is a simile: there is a man with short legs and a man with long legs;
 as they journey along together, while long-legs takes one step short-legs
 takes sixteen steps; when short-legs is making his sixteenth step, long-legs
 lifts his foot, draws it forward and makes a single step; so neither out-distan
ces the other, and they are commensurate.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elsewhere it is stated that the sub-moments of arising and dissolution are
 equal for both materiality and cognizance, only the presence sub-moment
 of materiality being longer.
 The Muula-Tiikaa, however, puts the mental presence sub-moment in question,
 commenting as follows on the passage just quoted: "Now it needs investigating
 whether there is what is here called 'presence sub-moment' of a cognizance
 or not." It cites the Citta Yamaka as follows "Is it, when arisen, arising?
 At the dissolution sub-moment it is arisen but it is not not arising" and
 "Is it, when not arising, not arisen? At the dissolution sub-moment it
 is not arising, but it is not unarisen" (Y.
 ii, 13) and two similar passages from the same source (Y.
 ii, 14), pointing out that only the dissolution sub-moment is mentioned
 instead of both, that and the presence sub-moment, as might be expected,
 had the Yamaka regarded the presence sub-moment as having valid application
 to cognizance.
 For that reason, the Muula-Tiikaa concludes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[The] non-existence of a presence sub-moment of cognizance is indicated.
 For although it is said in the Suttas "The alteration of what is present
 is evident" [AN 3.47/vol.
 i, 152], that does not mean either that a continuity alteration which is
 evident cannot be called "presence" [.thiti] because of absence of any alteratio
n of what is one only, or that what is existent [vijjamaana] by possessing
 the pair of sub-moments [of arising and dissolution] cannot be called "present"
 [.thita].

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third aspect of impermanence, that of the pattern or structure of specific
 conditionality, still remains.
 It is briefly stated thus "That comes to be when there is this; that arises
 with the arising of this, That does not come to be when this is not; that
 ceases with the cessation of this" (MN 38/vol.
 i, 262-4), or in the words that first awakened the two Chief Disciples:
 "A Tathaagata has told the cause of dhammas that have come into being due
 to a cause, and that which brings their cessation too: such is the doctrine
 preached by the Great Sama.na" (Mv.
 Kh.
 1).
 In more detail we find: "Consciousness acquires being [sambhoti] by dependence
 on a duality.
 What is that duality? It is eye, which is impermanent, changing, becoming-other
, and visible objects, which are impermanent, changing, and becoming-other:
 such is the transient, fugitive duality [of eye-cum-visible objects], which
 is impermanent, changing, and becoming-other.
 Eye-consciousness is impermanent, changing, and becoming-other; for this
 cause and condition [namely, eye-cum-visible objects] for the arising of
 eye-consciousness being impermanent, changing, and becoming-other, how
 could eye-consciousness, arisen by depending on an impermanent condition
 be permanent? Then the coincidence, concurrence and confluence of these
 three impermanent dhammas is called contact [phassa]; but eye-contact too
 is impermanent, changing, and becoming-other; for how could eye-contact,
 arisen by depending on an impermanent condition, be permanent? It is one
 touched by contact who feels [vedeti], likewise who chooses [ceteti], likewise
 who perceives [sa~njaanaati]; so these transient, fugitive dhammas too
 [namely, feeling, choice, and perception] are impermanent, changing, and
 becoming-other." (The same treatment is accorded to ear-cum-sounds, nose-cum-odo
rs, tongue-cum-flavors, body-cum-tangibles, and mind-cum-ideas: SN 35.93/vol.
 iv, 67-8).
 By further development we come to the formula of dependent origination
 (pa.ticca-samuppaada); but that is beyond the scope of this article.

 in the cases of feeling, perception, and formations, and mentality-materiality
 (naama-ruupa) for nutriment in the case of consciousness.

\begin_layout Standard
The present volume on anattaa concludes the treatment of The Three Basic
 Facts of Existence (or The Three Characteristics) within The Wheel series.
 Though the Buddha's teaching on not-self has been treated quite often in
 these publications it was felt that some more material from sources not
 easily accessible to the general reader should be offered here.
 From different angles, these essays and translations will throw light on
 that central teaching of Buddhism, anattaa.
 As the earlier books on anicca and dukkha, this volume, too, concludes
 with a concise and systematic treatment of the subject by the late venerable
 Ñanamoli Thera, which is a valuable guide to the source material as well
 as to a deeper study of this profound doctrine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diverse renderings chosen by the individual authors for the key term
 anattaa or nairaatmya (Skt.) have been retained.
 Hence it should be understood by the reader that egolessness, soullessness,
 impersonality and not-self all stand for the Pali term anattaa (Sanskrit:
 anaatma or nairaatmya).

\begin_layout Standard
More and more the noble teaching at the Buddha seems to be on the way to
 conquer the world.
 More than ever before, the Buddhists are working for its propagation in
 nearly all the countries of the earth.
 Especially in India, the birth place of Buddhism, whence it disappeared
 for nearly a thousand years, Buddhism has again made its entrance and gained
 a firm footing, and with rapid strides it is ever gaining more and more
 ground.
 One therefore should rather think it a good omen that India, having regained
 its independence, has adopted as its emblem the Buddhist Four-Lion symbol
 of Emperor Asoka, and that, at the proclamation of the Indian Republic,
 behind the presidential throne, crowned with this Buddhist emblem, there
 appeared the Buddha's statue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also all over Europe and America a mighty Buddhist wave is set in motion,
 which no longer can be kept back and suppressed and which, sooner or later,
 will flood the world with its beneficial influence.
 The world is no longer satisfied with dogmas based on blind belief.
 Everywhere in the world there is found today a striving for freedom and
 independence, externally and internally; and ever more the thinking man
 feels that the destinies of beings are not dependent on the omnipotence
 and infinite goodness of an imaginary creator, but that they rest entirely
 on the beings themselves.
 It is in Buddhism that one may find the true answers to many of the problems
 that are troubling men, and which they wish to get solved.
 Everybody knows that Buddhism is not a revealed religion and not based
 on blind belief, but that it is a doctrine to be realized by man's own
 understanding, a doctrine that makes man free and independent in his thinking,
 and assures him of happiness and peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But of one thing I wish to warn all those who are working for the propagation
 of Buddhism, namely: not to allow themselves to be influenced or carried
 away by seemingly identical theosophical, Christian, or what is still worse,
 materialistic teachings.
 For all these are, in essence and substance, very often diametrically opposed
 to the Buddha's doctrines and prevent a real understanding and realization
 of the profound law discovered and proclaimed by the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most crucial point for most men seems to be the Buddha's fundamental
 teaching of phenomenality, egolessness and impersonality of existence,
 in Pali anattaa.
 It is the middle way between two extremes, namely on the one hand the spiritual
istic belief in an eternal ego-entity, or soul, outlasting death; on the
 other hand the materialistic belief in a temporary ego-entity becoming
 annihilated at death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore it is said: There are three teachers in the world.
 The first teacher teaches the existence of an eternal ego-entity outlasting
 death: that is the Eternalist, as for example the Christian.
 The second teacher teaches a temporary ego-entity which becomes annihilated
 at death: that is the annihilationist, or materialist.
 The third teacher teaches neither an eternal, nor a temporary ego-entity:
 this is the Buddha.
 The Buddha teaches that, what we call ego, self, soul, personality etc.,
 are merely conventional terms not referring to any real independent entity.
 And he teaches that there is only to be found this psychophysical process
 of existence changing from moment to moment.
 Without understanding the egolessness of existence, it is not possible
 to gain a real understanding of the Buddha-word; and it is not possible
 without it to realize that goal of emancipation and deliverance of mind
 proclaimed by the Buddha.
 This doctrine of egolessness of existence forms the essence of the Buddha's
 doctrine of emancipation.
 Thus with this doctrine of egolessness, or anattaa, stands or falls the
 entire Buddhist structure.
 Indeed, for anyone who wishes to engage in the study of the Buddhist scriptures
, the best thing would be, from the very start, to get himself acquainted
 with the two methods, in which the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the world.
 The first method is the teaching in conventional language; the second method
 is the teaching in philosophically correct language.
 The first one relates to conventional truth, the second, to truth in the
 ultimate sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, whenever the Buddha uses such terms as I, person, living being, etc.,
 this is to be understood as conventional speech, hence not correct in the
 highest sense.
 It is just as speaking of the rising and setting of the sun, though we
 know thoroughly well that this does not correspond to reality.
 Thus the Buddha teaches that, in the ultimate sense, amongst all these
 psychophysical phenomena of existence there cannot be found any eternal
 or even temporary ego-entity, and hence that all existence of whatever
 kind is something impersonal, or anattaa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this connection I would like to emphasize the fact that this fundamental
 doctrine of egolessness and emptiness is not, as some misinformed Western
 Buddhists assert, only taught in the southern school of Buddhism, but that
 even in the so-called the Mahayana schools it forms a most essential part.
 Without this teaching of anattaa, or egolessness, there is no Buddhism;
 and without having realized the truth of egolessness no real progress is
 possible on the path to deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha is, in every respect, a teacher at the golden mean, ethically
 as well as philosophically.
 From the ethical standpoint, for example, the Buddha rejects two extremes:
 the way of sensual pleasures and the way of self-torture.
 From the philosophical standpoint he rejects eternity, as well as temporariness
 of an ego entity.
 Just so he rejects belief in an absolute identity and an absolute otherness
 of the various stages of the process of existence.
 He rejects the determinism, as well as the belief in chance.
 He rejects the belief in absolute existence and absolute non-existence;
 likewise in freedom of will, as well as in unfreedom of will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these things will become clear to one who understands the egolessness
 and conditioned nature of all phenomena of existence.
 On the understanding of these two truths depends the understanding of the
 entire doctrine of the Buddha.
 Hence the understanding and final penetration of the egolessness and conditione
dness of all phenomena of existence are the necessary foundation to the
 realization of the noble eightfold path leading to deliverance from all
 vanity and misery, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech,
 right bodily action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
 and right concentration of mind.
 Only this golden middle path, based on these two kinds of right understanding,
 namely of "egolessness and conditionedness," can alleviate and destroy
 these vain illusions of "self" and craving, which are the root-causes of
 all war and bloodshed in the world.
 But without these two kinds of understanding there is no realization of
 the holy and peaceful goal pointed out by the Buddha.
 There are however, to be found various would-be Buddhists in the West who
 are attached to an imaginary Great Self, and who uphold that the Buddha
 did in no way reject the view of an "eternal Atman," or soul, behind and
 independent of the phenomena of existence, and who believe that the Mahayana
 texts teach such a doctrine.
 Such assertions, however, do not in the least prove correct, for neither
 do the Pali texts, nor the early Mahayana texts proclaim an eternal self.
 Any reader, who is unbiased in mind and free from prejudices, can never
 from a study of the Buddhist scriptures come to the conclusion that the
 Buddha ever taught any such ego-entity within or outside the corporeal,
 mental and spiritual phenomena of existence.
 Nowhere in the world can there be found such an entity, as was clearly
 pointed out by the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the questions whether the Holy One will continue after death,
 or not continue etc., the Buddha says that all such questions are wrongly
 put.
 And why? Because what is called the "Holy One" is here only a conventional
 term and refers to no real entity while in reality there is only to be
 found a process of corporeal, mental, and spiritual phenomena.
 In another text, therefore the Buddhist asks a monk, whether he considered
 corporeality as the Holy One, or the feelings, or the perceptions, or the
 mental formations, or consciousness.
 Or whether he believed the Holy One to exist within these five groups of
 phenomena or outside thereof.
 Or whether all these phenomena heaped together were the Holy One.
 And denying all these questions, the Buddha further said that, even during
 lifetime, the Holy One could not be discovered in reality, and that therefore
 it would be wrong to ask whether the Holy One will continue or not continue
 after death, etc.
 Thus, no entities are existing in the world, but only ever-changing processes.
 The Buddha further says: Only because man does not understand corporeality,
 feeling and the other mental and spiritual phenomena being impermanent,
 unsatisfactory and impersonal (aniccaa, dukkha, and anattaa), and does
 not understand their conditioned origin, their extinction, and the path
 leading to their extinction, therefore he will think that the Holy One
 does continue, or does not continue after death etc.
 This, therefore, is the reason why the Buddha did not answer such questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Buddhism, the whole of existence is comprised in the five groups
 of phenomena mentioned above, or still more briefly expressed in the three
 groups: corporeality, consciousness, and the mental factors.
 And within these three groups are comprised the only and ultimate things
 given, though also these again are mere fleeting and evanescent phenomena,
 flashing up for a moment, in order to disappear immediately thereafter
 forever.
 Thus whenever in the Buddhist scriptures mention is made of I, self, living
 being, etc., even of the Buddha, these expressions accordingly are used
 merely as conventional terms, without referring to any real entities.
 Therefore the Buddha has said: "It is impossible, it cannot be that a man
 with real understanding should ever consider anything as a real entity."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He who does not understand the egolessness of existence, and who still attached
 to ego-illusion, such a one cannot comprehend and understand the four Noble
 Truths of the Buddha in the true light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These four truths are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the truth of the impermanency, unsatisfactoriness and impersonality of existence
;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the truth that repeated rebirth and misery are rooted in self-illusion and
 craving for existence;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the truth that through the extinction of all self-illusion vanity, and craving,
 deliverance from all rebirth will be attained;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the truth that the eightfold path, based on right understanding, is the
 path leading to this goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He who has not penetrated the ego-illusion and is still attached to self-vanity
 will believe that it is he himself that suffers, will believe that is he
 himself that performs the good and evil deeds leading to his rebirth, that
 it is he himself that will enter Nirvana, that is he himself that will
 bring the eightfold path to perfection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whoso, however, has fully penetrated the egolessness of existence, knows
 that, in the highest sense, there is no individual that suffers, that commits
 the kammic deeds, that enters Nirvana, and that brings the Eightfold Path
 to perfection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Visuddhi Magga it is therefore said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found.
 The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there, Nirvana is, but not the
 man that enters it.
 The path is, but no traveller on it is seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, wherever the doctrine of the egolessness of all existence is
 rejected, there the Buddha's word is rejected.
 But wherever, through penetration of the egolessness of all existence,
 the ego-vanity has reached ultimate extinction, there the goal of the Buddha's
 teaching has been realized, namely: freedom from all vanity of I and Mine,
 and the highest peace of Nibbaana.

Self

\begin_layout Standard
by G.N.
 Lewis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If something is yours you have power over it; you can make it into whatever
 you wish.
 It will change according to your plans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But have you power over your self? Can you make your body larger or smaller
 or let it be this or that as you desire?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it is not governed by your power but by its own laws and processes then
 it is not yours.
 If it were the body would not be involved in sickness for you would be
 able to make it be whatever you wished.
 Admittedly one has control over the body to an extent but not as much as
 one has over this house or any other possession.
 Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your body was once very much more delicate and smaller than it is now.
 Now it is bigger and stronger.
 It will get weaker and degenerate later on.
 This body which you call yours — has it developed and deteriorated according
 to your will? Or perhaps the question of ownership does not arise — the
 body being subject to the same laws of nature as everything else, i.e., birth,
 decay, and death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this is so, should one be concerned or unconcerned regarding the body?
 If neglected, the natural processes of destruction act quickly, disease
 and death soon resulting.
 Therefore food, exercise, and clothing must be used to maintain it and
 to stop the natural processes being accelerated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do people feed and dress the body for maintenance only, and, if not, why?
 Take a person who dresses only to keep his body protected from the elements.
 What's wrong with this? Should he be criticized and, if he is, for what?
 Because others don't dress similarly doesn't mean he's doing something
 wrong.
 Someone may say he looks ugly and unsightly but how did we learn what ugliness
 was in the first place? Is the person criticizing him or his clothes? Well,
 "him" is not the body; the person criticizing him is not taking offense
 at the body but just at the clothes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where opinion together with vanity creep in and facts become concealed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leaving the body let us turn to another aspect of self — feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say a man tries to grasp something which continually slips through his fingers.
 Can he say that thing is his? He tries to keep it but he can never clutch
 it solidly and he would never dream of calling that thing his own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But say he has a fountain pen.
 That really seems to be his own.
 It is always with him and it keeps its shape and doesn't change very much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How about feelings — happiness, indifference, and pain? Are not these like
 the first example? How can we ever say feelings are our own? If they were,
 happiness would be ours for the rest of our life and not an illusive thing
 which comes and goes against our wishes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Body is born, it decays and dies.
 Likewise we find on investigation that exactly the same is true for feelings.
 The body does not come from nothing.
 It starts off by the fusing of two cells from mother and father.
 By way of nourishment it grows and develops.
 Then it dies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feeling is born of sense-impingement; e.g., eye and material shape lead to
 sense impingement, which leads to visual consciousness which leads to feeling
 — pleasant, indifferent or painful according to whether or not what has
 been seen is liked or disliked as a result of past experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we see how feeling is born.
 But this feeling changes.
 If a painful feeling arises we are not content but crave to get away from
 it.
 Alternatively if we have perceived something that gives a pleasing feeling
 we long to keep this feeling and try to possess whatever has caused it
 to arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why don't feelings last? Because the very things from which they arise do
 not last.
 Therefore if we do not grasp after feelings we never suffer.
 Feelings are continually born and continually die but the body takes a
 long time to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we cannot call body our own, how much less so is this true of feelings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now examine a third aspect of ourselves — perception.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do we perceive and is it we who actually perceive? Perception is the
 recognition of sense-impingements.
 How is it born?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hear a loud noise and recognize that a door has been slammed.
 What is the basis of this recognition? Firstly, without the ear no sound
 would be heard; therefore the ear is a necessary basis.
 The sound impinges on the year, this being sensory impingement.
 From this perception arises, but like feelings it does not last and soon
 dies away, another rising in its place.
 Do I enter into this perception? Do I perceive the door slamming? No.
 We have definitely seen that perception arose of its own accord, with oneself
 not being involved at all.
 Well, if body, feeling and perception are not "me," what is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before this can be answered there is yet another aspect of ourselves and
 this is volitional action.
 Here surely we shall find our true self.
 I say to a friend "I am going to do that" and I keep to what I've said.
 Here it appears a deliberate choice has been made between doing two specific
 things: either I will or I won't.
 How does the will or act of choosing arise, or is it there all the time?
 Does it only come into force when we have to make a choice? On investigation
 we find that this is so; for example: I'm going to ride my bicycle tonight.
 This is a deliberate choice.
 I could have gone to the cinema or for a walk.
 Why did I choose riding? Does volition come into this at all? What other
 volitional tendencies are there?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have killed a man.
 Surely volition was there.
 But if I ask myself why I wanted to kill him, several interesting things
 come to light.
 For argument's sake let us say he murdered my wife.
 I was very attached to her.
 He took something away from me which I wanted.
 Missing the pleasurable feelings which were continually aroused by my wife's
 company, a painful feeling took its place when I lost her and I craved
 to get the former feeling back.
 The only satisfaction for me was to get rid of the object (the man) which
 caused the painful feeling to arise and therefore I killed him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we see from this example that the volitional drive (the desire to kill)
 had a basis for arising and we see also that after arising it passed away
 on completion of its primary object (the death of a man).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Volition therefore is a conditioned force directed specifically toward something
, e.g., I can arouse myself to apply my mind to something.
 But, as just proved, volition is a conditioned phenomenon.
 Can I therefore be equated with volition? If so, I only exist when volition
 is present; when it passes away I die also.
 But we say we are present all the time — therefore I cannot be equated
 with volition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion we can state that if I say, "I'm going to do this or that,"
 what this really means is that this or that is going to be done, not by
 me but through cause and necessity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, we still have not found ourselves; yet there is only one more aspect
 of ourselves to consider — consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are you conscious, am I conscious? "Yes," is the usual immediate answer.
 If this were not so you would say, "I'd be unconscious." Can you be conscious
 without being conscious of anything? Most people would say not.
 Let us find out what are the factors involved in being conscious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can one be conscious without a body? Not that we know of, so we can assume
 from this that consciousness arises dependent on the body.
 Will there be consciousness if no sense-organs are in the body? We can
 categorically state that there will not be.
 So our second step is that consciousness is dependent on the sense-organs.
 Will there be consciousness with body and sense-organs and no internal
 or external sense-impingement? Again we can say definitely, "No." Given
 sense-impingement shall we be conscious? Yes, but it will not be a very
 meaningful consciousness.
 We shall see a conglomeration of colors, hear noises, smell things, have
 bodily sensations, and taste things, but not be able to recognize them.
 If perception is missing one cannot say, "I am conscious."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have already discussed perception and shown that it is not one's real
 self.
 Sense-consciousness, together with perception, gives us our awareness of
 things, but is there an "I" who is aware? If you say, "I am conscious of
 a vase of flowers on the table," are you really conscious of it? By our
 investigation we have tried to show that you do not enter into is at all
 and that consciousness, like all the other aspects of self, has birth,
 decay, and death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fall into the delusion that the body, feelings, perception, volitional
 action, and consciousness are you is to suffer because unfortunately they
 are not of you and you are not of them, and you cannot expect them ever
 to give satisfaction for very long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion I would say that the more disgusted one becomes with compounded
 things the closer one gets to things that give lasting happiness.

Physical and Biological Aspects of Anattaa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by Edward Greenly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The labors of a succession of devoted scholars, from Turnour to Rhys Davids,
 has now made impossible, at any rate for all serious students of religion,
 the cruder misconceptions of Buddhism that were current in Europe at the
 end of last century.
 Its deeply intellectual character, its unique and unsullied record of tolerance
, its priority (relatively to the Mediterranean systems) of five centuries
 in promulgation of the higher ethic, all these things are now widely known.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet in spite of all this, even among such as are devoid of prejudice,
 it is seldom that one meets with a real, penetrating understanding of the
 Teaching.
 To some its philosophy, to others its influence, appear alike unintelligible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the source of this perplexity, it may safely be affirmed, is, invariably,
 a failure to apprehend that characteristic and central doctrine or principle
 of Buddhism that is summed up in the Pali term anattaa.
 Without this, there must appear to be an unbridgeable gap in the Buddhist
 doctrine of causation, its power over the hearts and lives of men must
 seem incapable of explanation, its final goal still present the insoluble
 enigma that it has for long presented to the European mind.
 Anattaa once comprehended, however, all whether thought or practice, is
 clear and open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term is generally explained as meaning "denial of the soul"; and yet
 such a translation is apt to be somewhat misleading to a European.
 For it involves, in a certain sense, both less and more than that.
 It does not by any means imply, for example, that "death ends all" in the
 sense of some of the Western schools.
 And on the other hand, the idea of a "soul" is but a part, though indeed
 the most important part, of the great body of conceptions which it denies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taken in connection with aniccaa, the principle of impermanence, that which
 it denies is the idea of separate and abiding substance in anything whatever
 in the whole unbounded universe, whether psychical or physical.
 Psyche, of course, was the particular kind of substance which the Buddhist
 teachers had in view, and its proper treatment is, naturally, psychological.
 But every kind of substance comes under the same condemnation; and, as
 the Western mind of today is far more at home in, and thinks far more clearly
 and powerfully upon, physical affairs, a consideration of some of the physical
 and biological aspects of anattaa is likely to be the best possible preparation
 for an understanding of those psychical aspects of it which the Buddhist
 teachers so earnestly labored to convey, the more so as such cases are,
 it should most clearly be understood, not "illustrations" or analogies
 only; they are actual examples of the principle itself.

Consider such a phenomenon as a rainbow.
 To the unsophisticated mind, a rainbow is just as real as any other object,
 much more vivid and real than the faint and distant hills that lie beyond
 it.
 A child, indeed, filled with longing, will beg that it may be given to
 him, that he may have and hold and possess for himself this beautiful and
 brilliant thing.
 Later on, he learns something of its real nature, learns that there is
 in it no "thing" whatever capable of being so held; that it is but a conditioni
ng of certain rays of light and drops of water, and has no existence in
 itself at all.1 That is precisely, the anattaa doctrine.
 The rainbow is anattaa.
 This step in sound philosophy every sane adult is taught to take.
 How many take any further steps? For most, "the cares of life and the deceitful
ness of riches" — riches often of another world as much as of this — occupy
 the mind entirely, and there is no desire for further knowledge.
 Yet to some, one day to all, the question cannot but arise — "If this be
 so, if the rainbow be but a conditioning, how about the things of which
 it is a conditioning? How about the light and water? Surely those are real
 enough?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Very well, then.
 The light, first, what is that? Little as we all know, we know enough to
 answer that it is an undulation or vibration, a particular kind of very
 rapid movement of something.
 But what is this but just the very answer that was given to the child about
 the rainbow, given to the adult about the light? Just as that rainbow was
 a conditioning of the light and had no existence in itself, so now the
 light proves to be a conditioning in its turn, to have no more existence
 in itself than the rainbow had.
 The light, too is anattaa.
 Yet, if it be an undulation of what is it an undulation? Of the ether.2
 And what is this ether? Here we are getting near the limits of our knowledge.
 Yet this much can be said, that it is not matter.
 It is not this, it is not that, it is not the other — to any question concernin
g it, such are the replies: and yet it is not non-existence.
 Seek it, and it vanishes from the grasp of the mind, just as the rainbow
 and the light did in their turn.
 It is the very type of insubstantiality, of anattaa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The water, however: that at least is tangible and substantive enough.
 Here is existence in a way that cannot be denied.
 Go far enough to north or south, and water will react to even the Johnsonian
 fist.
 Nevertheless, let it but feel the touch of a lump of sodium, or even of
 a few inches of hot copper, and where is it? Vanished utterly, and in its
 place two things that are no more water than it or light were rainbow.
 Water in itself, then, is not and never was — nothing "was" but a particular
 conditioning of these other things, this hydrogen and oxygen, as we call
 them; and "water" is but a name for such conditioning.
 Nor need we even think that this water-conditioning is the rule, and the
 water-abolishing experiments mere curious exceptions.
 Throughout the whole vast universe that is visible to us, only in a score
 of tiny specks is that the case.
 Not for one fleeting moment in the great star that daily lights us, or
 in a single one of the millions of its peers in the depths of space, could
 the water-conditioning hold good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the constituents of the rainbow, therefore, are as truly anattaa as
 the rainbow itself.
 As in the case of the first constituent, however, the question leads us
 further.
 What of these elements, this hydrogen and this oxygen, into which the water
 has resolved itself? Well, it is true that, misled by the unsound views
 of the nature of things in which they were brought up, many, probably most,
 chemists did, for a long time, think that in the ultimate combining particle,
 the "atom" of such elements, real, separate, and abiding substance had
 at last been hunted down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all, indeed, were so deceived.
 Hardly had the atomic theory been formulated, when discerning minds began
 to seek, first by one means, then by another, for that of which the atom
 must be but a compounding.
 The time had not come, and they were baffled.
 How in the last few years they have been completely justified, how abiding
 substance eludes us no less in the atom than it does elsewhere, has been
 already told elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hydrogen and oxygen, therefore, are in their turn nothing but conditionings
 of something else, and when we inquire concerning that of which they are
 conditionings, then, as we have done to the ether, we can give to it a
 name, we can show that it must behave in such and such a way; but the moment
 that we attempt to lay the profane finger of thought upon it, and say that
 it is this or that, it is gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of the rainbow, so of all things: process there is, conditioning there
 is, but nowhere the least trace of substance, nowhere the least trace of
 "self."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is the anattaa doctrine as exemplified by matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the theory of the soul, familiar to all of us from our childhood,
 each living body, at any rate each living human body, is inhabited and
 informed by a single psychic entity, the thinker of all its thoughts, doer
 of its deeds, and director of the organism generally.
 In Christianity, until very lately, such a soul was ascribed to human beings
 only; animals had no souls.
 For them death ended all, without even the hope of a future life in which
 might be redeemed some of their unmerited sufferings; and the present writer
 well remembers his passionate yearnings as a child after a larger hope
 for some of the dear animals he loved so well, and remembers the quenching
 of this hope by his orthodox instructors.3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Roman Catholic Church still holds valorously to this ancient orthodoxy,4
 but the rapidly-growing feeling of compassion for animal suffering that
 has sprung up in the Western world during the past hundred years, and is
 one of its kindliest and noblest features,5 has, outside the Roman pale,
 begun to modify opinion, and souls are now postulated for at any rate the
 higher animals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concurrently with this, an influence of a different kind has accelerated
 the movement of men's minds in the same direction.
 This comes from the acceptance, now general, of the theory of evolution.
 Fear for the existence of the human soul was the motive, indeed, of much
 of the early opposition to that theory, but now that resistance is no longer
 possible, it is coming to be felt that a worthier way out of the difficulty
 is to be found in the concession of a soul to these our fellow-beings.
 The inter-relationship and unity of all life left, indeed, no other way,
 if the soul theory was to be held at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unity of life, however, has other bearings very searching, some of them,
 upon the whole question and a consideration of these may throw some light
 upon animistic views in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For there is no stopping at the higher animals, still less at those who
 are our especial friends and lovers.
 If we concede a soul to a dog, so must we also to a wolf; if to a cat,
 then also to a tiger.
 Nor can we call a halt at any place, as, passing from these sensitive and
 splendid beings, we descend lower and lower through the mammalia till we
 reach the very humblest of the primitive marsupials.
 But the mammalia form but one of the branches of the Tree of Life; bird,
 reptile, fish put in the same claim, and it cannot be denied to them.
 Not even the lowly Amphioxus brooks the refusal of a soul, and he, standing
 at the confines of his kingdom, opens the gates to the still vaster and
 dimmer armies of the life we call Invertebrate.
 To cut an almost endless story short, we find even here no place at which
 to stop, and are fain to concede at last that the microscopic protoplasmic
 cell-units called the protozoa are as able to make good their title as
 the lordliest of the mammalia.
 Besides, if we were inclined to pass them by with a De minimis non curat
 lex, they could reinforce their claim, by pointing out that man himself
 enters upon his existence as a protozoan unit indistinguishable from themselves
, and that if this unit contains a soul, why should not each of them contain
 one likewise?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another curious consideration.
 If my soul enters upon existence along with me, and is mine and no one
 else's, so also does any other being's even such as a protozoan's, and
 it is his soul and no other protozoan's.
 Now, man propagates his kind at an exceptionally slow rate, but the rate
 of increase in the lower ranks of life is prodigious.
 Statisticians amuse themselves sometimes by computations of the progeny
 of a single cod-fish in quite a moderate space of time, and the results
 are astonishing.
 But the multiplication of the protozoa proceeds by geometrical progression,
 so that, without books at hand, I am afraid to quote the shortness of the
 period in which one such will have given rise to millions.
 The influx of new souls into this world alone, therefore, is proceeding
 at a rate beyond all power of numbers to convey, and when we reflect that
 this has been going on throughout the whole of geological time, the conception
 is truly staggering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well-found indeed must be the ship of speculation that can carry such a
 freight as that across the stormy seas of modern thought!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have considered the single soul in a single body, such as we ourselves
 have been taught we are endowed with.
 But there are cases not so simple.
 Among the coelenterata and the polyzoa there are, as well as a single hydroid
 animals, many species of compound ones, in which whole colonies of such
 beings are united by a "coenosarc" or flesh-body common to them all.
 What are we to say of the soul in a case of this sort? Shall we ascribe
 it to the individuals, to the coenosarc, or to the colony as a whole? The
 individual is just such another as any simple hydroid, yet if we assign
 to him a soul like that of the simple one, what becomes of the coenosarc,
 which is just as much alive? Or, if we assign it to the community, then
 why, to the hydra that is rooted in a coenosarc, should be denied that
 which is conceded to his cousin who is rooted on a stone? And, as if this
 were not perplexing enough, sometimes a member of such a community will
 detach himself from it altogether, and conduct his life on his own account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To return, however, to the higher beings, ourselves included, with a single
 body and its single soul.
 Closely bound up with the theory of evolution are the facts of histology,
 the structures and relationships, that is to say, of the microscopic units
 that compose the living being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider, first, the corpuscles of the blood.
 They are of the two kinds, the large white corpuscles, and the smaller
 red ones.
 Both are cells, but we will consider just now the white ones.
 They are minute specks of living protoplasm, constantly changing their
 shape, moving slowly about, and living upon what they meet with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, amongst the protozoa, animals consisting of a single cell, whose claims
 to a single soul we were obliged to admit capable of being made good with
 such irresistible effect, is a creature known as the amoeba.
 It is a speck of protoplasm that moves slowly about from point to point,
 changing its shape as it goes along, and living upon any suitable object
 it can meet with.
 The white blood-corpuscles, in short, and the amoeba are indistinguishable
 in composition, aspect and behavior.
 They differ in nothing but their habitat: the amoeboid corpuscle (as it
 is called) can make every whit as effective a claim to a single soul as
 the amoeba.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The one, however, is an independent being; the other an integral part of
 a most essential portion of our own economy, essential, indeed, for without
 them the blood cannot perform its functions; and is not the blood, as we
 have long ago been told, "the life" (Deut.
 xii,23)? Even if we take refuge in the brain, and seek to locate the soul
 where thought goes on, to that retreat also they pursue us; for stop the
 blood, and in a few short minutes thinking ceases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly there is something wrong.
 It is evident that the simple-seeming hypothesis of a single soul in a
 single body hides a world of perplexities and complications.
 The difficulty of the hydrozoan coenosarc has reappeared in a more subtle
 form than ever, and that within our own breasts, the very citadel of the
 soul-hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor is this even the end of the matter.
 The relations of the amoeboid corpuscle to the amoeba strike the mind at
 once, and the lessons that they teach are past mistaking.
 But the red corpuscle is no whit less a cell, which, were it found elsewhere
 than in the blood, would pass without challenge as one among many protozoan
 creatures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, further still.
 If we watch through the microscope a drop of pond-water full of paramecium
 or any other simple animals, it will not be long before we see one of them
 constrict into a sort of "waist," develop there a medial cell-wall, and
 part along that into two, each of which proceeds without more ado to go
 about its own business.6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In paramecium and its congeners the new cells leave each other, but in slightly
 higher animals they remain united along the medial wall, dividing, perhaps,
 and redividing until we have a tissue or colony of several cells.
 The members of such a tissue are to the free separating cells as the hydroids
 of a coenosarcal community to the solitary hydroids.
 The inner nature of the cell remains the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, all the tissues of the living body are neither more nor less than just
 such colonies.
 Modified in various ways according to the nature of the tissue, here for
 muscle, here for skin, there for bone, differently again for nerve, and
 finally in a special way for brain itself: the units of these tissues are,
 throughout the body, cells, alike in their essential nature, different
 only in their modifications.
 The blood corpuscles are just some of these cells which, in order to perform
 a particular function, remained detached and free to move, like the protozoa.
 And every activity of the being, physical or psychical, depends entirely
 on the co-ordinated activities, physical or psychical, of this vast multitude,
 which indeed no man can number.
 But each one of these is, as we now perceive, a being to whom, if we set
 out the hypothesis of souls, it is logically impossible to refuse a separate
 soul-unit of its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seeking in the first part of this article for the essential, inner self
 or being of the rainbow, light, water, and their elements, we found that
 there was not in any one of them any essential self or being whatsoever.
 Every one of them turned out to be, by its very nature, a conditioning
 of elements that were not itself, and this held good to the last stages
 of analysis that knowledge could apply.
 Every one of them had to be pronounced anattaa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What have we now found (using a biological analysis) to be the case of the
 living being? We have found it to be, more conspicuously if possible than
 even those other phenomena, a conditioning of a vast number of elements
 that are not one of them itself, dependent absolutely upon these elements,
 having apart from them and their activities no existence "in itself" whatever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beginning with a phenomenon, the rainbow, with regard to which the Anattaa
 doctrine is already held by every sane adult, we have followed that doctrine
 and found it to apply to the highest form of existence that we know upon
 this earth.
 From the biological point of view, the living being is, and that in a superlati
ve degree, anattaa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further treatment of the anattaa subject is, of course, psychological.
 With that, this article is not concerned.
 But any sound psychology must be in harmony, not at variance, with biology
 and physics.
 Suffice it, then, to say here, that we may be sure that what is biologically
 compound will not prove to be psychologically simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Were we ever inclined to regard the doctrines of anattaa and the khandhas
 as either fantastic or perverse, we may wonder rather at the discernment
 which perceived the one, long before biology and physics were, and at the
 moderation which gave us but five khandhas where modern science would give
 for one of them alone (viz.
 ruupa) something much more like five hundred millions! Far more marvellous,
 however, was that surpassing spiritual penetration that could see, in this
 compositeness of our nature, nothing less than the balm of sorrow, the
 justification of the Golden Rule, and life's liberation from the house
 of bondage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parts of this article may have, perhaps, a somewhat polemical expression.
 Well, argument, if undertaken at all, should be made conclusive and convincing,
 if that be possible, and should result in intellectual conviction.
 But intellectual conviction is not religion, it may not even have religion
 as its consequence in life.
 Something more is needed.
 He who discerns not life's pathos and its sorrow, will not find out the
 Annattaa path of love to sorrow's utter ceasing.

\begin_layout Standard
1.The writer can even now recall his own childish perplexity at being told
 that a rainbow was "the sun shining upon drops of water." For what resemblance
 of any kind did it bear to either drops of water or the sun?2.The theory
 of a "luminiferous ether" as the medium in which light — and all forms
 of electromagnetic radiation — propagates was dealt a mortal blow in the
 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment.
 The final nails were hammered in its coffin by Einstein in 1905.
 The author, writing in 1911, was probably not aware of this.
 — ATI ed.3.The great Bishop Butler, however, ventured to suggest some such
 hope.4.With the sinister corollary that as animals have no souls, neither
 have they any rights.5.In the Buddhist countries of Asia such a sentiment
 has long prevailed.6.In passing, it may well be asked, what has happened
 with the soul.
 Has that divided also, or has a new soul arisen to animate one of the two
 bodies? And if so, which, for they are substantially equal and alike?

The Spell of Narcissism and the Anattaa Doctrine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by M.W.
 Padmasiri de Silva
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Narcissism is a passion the intensity of which in many individuals can
 only be compared with sexual desire and the desire to stay alive.
 In fact, many times it proves to be stronger than either.
 Even in the average individual in whom it does not reach such intensity,
 there remains a narcissistic core which appears to be almost indestructible."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— Erich Fromm, The Heart of Man
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word "narcissism" is derived from a Greek legend.
 Narcissus in mythology is a beautiful youth who loved no one till he saw
 his own body reflected in water.
 Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection; finally he pined away,
 died, and was turned into the flower of like name.1 Thus the word "narcissism"
 derived from this legend has been generally used to refer to a kind of
 morbid self-love.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of narcissism was woven into psychological theory by Sigmund
 Freud.
 Freud himself borrowed this name from Paul Nacke, who used the term to
 describe a perversion, where "an adult individual lavishes upon his own
 body all the caresses expended only upon a sexual object other than himself."3
 it was Freud, however, who grasped for the first time the tremendous significan
ce of the concept of narcissism.
 Freud's essay on narcissism is one of the richest spots in his psychology,
 unfortunately neglected by his fellow psychiatrists and submerged by the
 popular image of Freud's work.
 Freud's essay on narcissism is a little gem which would have been pushed
 into an insignificant corner in the field of psychological theory, but
 for the efforts of Eric Fromm who remarks that, "One of the most fruitful
 and far-reaching of Freud's discoveries is his concept of narcissism.
 Freud himself considered it to be one of his most important findings..."4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper I shall very briefly refer to the Freudian concept of narcissism
 and then present Fromm's development on this against the background of
 the anattaa doctrine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before his paper on narcissism appeared, Freud made a clear distinction
 between the sexual instinct (libido) and the ego instinct, or in more popular
 terms between "love" and "hunger." But he came across an interesting category
 of patients whose condition presented a great challenge to this distinction
 between sexual and ego instincts.
 "We became slowly accustomed to the conception that the libido, which we
 find attached to certain objects and which is the desire to gain some satisfact
ion in these objects, can also abandon these objects and set the ego itself
 in their place," says Freud.5 More reflection on this point made him realize
 that a fixation of this kind to the subject's own body and his person was
 not something accidental, it is probable that this is the original condition
 of man (primary narcissism) out of which object love develops later without
 thereby necessarily affecting a disappearance of narcissism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This conception of narcissism was backed by evidence from a number of sources.
 In megalomania, we get the subjective over-estimation of self-importance,
 in dementia praecox we get the magical belief in the "omnipotence of thought."
 Freud also studied the mind of the infant and the primitive man and here
 too discovered an expression of narcissism.
 There are also other situations in life like disease, after an accident,
 in old age etc., "when the tendency to this withdrawal into self-preoccupation
 is apt to become pronounced." Normal love is also affected by a great deal
 of narcissism.
 The notion of narcissism was used to explain a wide range of distinct phenomena
 ranging from love, jealousy, and fear to mass phenomena.
 Continuing on these lines Fromm has worked out the spell of narcissism
 in group behavior, nationalism, and war.
 It was due to Fromm's insight that the concept of narcissism was salvaged
 from its limited base in the libido theory and given a more comprehensive
 interpretation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Narcissism in Buddhism and the Writings of Fromm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fromm himself makes a reference to Buddhism which is extremely significant
 for an understanding of narcissism.
 Fromm says that the essential teachings of all the humanistic religions
 in the world can be summarized in one sentence: "It is the goal of man
 to overcome one's narcissism.
 Perhaps this principle is nowhere expressed more radically than in Buddhism."6
 Fromm concludes on these lines that if man sheds the "illusion of his indestruc
tible ego" and the other objects of greed, only then can he be totally open,
 awake and be fully related to the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The illusion of the indestructible ego that Fromm mentions is quite clearly
 a reference to the Buddhist doctrine of anattaa (egolessness).
 There is no ego entity existing apart and independently of those physical
 and mental processes that constitute life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The illusion of the ego has two basic forms: eternity belief and annihilation
 belief.
 The craving for selfish pursuits arises with a false conception of personality,
 based on the dogma of personal immortality (sassata-di.t.thi), and the craving
 for annihilation arises with a false conception of personality, based on
 the annihilationist view (uccheda di.t.thi).7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An understanding of the doctrine of sakkaaya-di.t.thi (twenty forms of wrong
 personality beliefs) helps us to grasp the Buddhist doctrine of egolessness.
 Where there is a mere complex of corporeality, feeling, perception, disposition
s, and consciousness, the individual being subject to the ego illusion assumes
 the existence of an ego:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1-5: Ego is identified with corporeality, feeling, perception, dispositions,
 and consciousness.6-10: Ego is contained in them.11-15: Ego is independent
 of them.16-20: Ego is their owner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does not mean that the ego is merely an intellectual construction.
 The roots of the ego illusion are strong and it is fed by deep effective
 processes.8 These processes are dormant proclivities described in the Discourses
 of the Buddha as the latent desire for continued existence (bhava-raaga
 anusaya).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Corporeal Overtones of the Ego Concept
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The origin of the Freudian concept of narcissism is the point at which Narcissus
 falls in love with his own body.
 In relating auto-eroticism to narcissism, Freud says that the ego is first
 and foremost a "body-ego." Fromm also says that one of the most elementary
 examples of narcissism can be found in the attitude to the body exhibited
 by the average person.9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The narcissistic relation to one's body has its parallel in the doctrine
 of the Buddha, where he discusses the operation of personality beliefs
 (atta di.t.thi) in relation to corporeality.
 The majority of the people who are not skilled in the doctrine of the Buddha
 are subject to the ego-illusion associated with their body.
 This ego-illusion is described in the suttas: These people who are untrained
 in the doctrine of the Buddha, "regard body as the self (attaaa, Skr: aatman);
 they regard the self as having a body, body as being in the self, the self
 as being in the body.
 'I am the body,' say they; 'body is mine'; and they are possessed by this
 idea." The Buddha also says that due to the excessive attachment to the
 body, when it alters and changes, sorrow and grief set in; thus the doctrine
 of anattaa is linked to the doctrine of dukkha (suffering).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, while the body-image concept of the ego dominates the thought of
 Freud, the Buddha offers a more comprehensive analysis, relating the ego-illusi
on to feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness.
 To use a phrase of Wolheim, "the corporeal overtones of the ego concept"
 prevented Freud from presenting a broad base for his theory of narcissism.
 In fact, Wolheim has pointed out a significant ambiguity in the Freudian
 analysis of narcissism.
 Sometimes Freud conceives narcissism as an attraction towards one's own
 person, and sometimes as an attraction towards one's own body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fromm has not merely re-vitalized the Freudian concept of narcissism, but
 takes it very much beyond this, and brings it close to the doctrine of
 the Buddha.
 Not merely does Fromm offer a theory of narcissism which is of interest
 to the Buddhist, but he quite clearly refers to the doctrine of the Buddha:
 "The 'awakened' person of whom Buddhist teaching speaks is the person who
 has overcome his narcissism, and who is therefore capable of being fully
 awake."10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Narcissistic "Self-Image"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The narcissistic person is not only proud of his body but he has an exaggerated
 and inflated image of all aspects of his personality: his intelligence,
 his honor and his wealth, his social standing, etc.
 "Just as the narcissistic person has made his 'self-image' the object of
 his narcissistic attachment, he does the same with everything connected
 with him.
 His ideas, his knowledge, his house, but also people in his 'sphere of
 interest' become objects of his narcissistic attachment."11 As both Freud
 and Fromm point out, one's narcissistic image about oneself is projected
 on to the children.
 This is extended to identification with wider groups, culminating in nationalis
m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Karen Horney was quick to point out that at the root of this kind of narcissisti
c self-image is found a kind of "self-inflation" rather than "self-love,"
 with a need not for love but the admiration of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point we see the relevance of the Buddhist concept of maana (self-concei
t).
 Self-conceit, according to the Buddha, takes three forms: I am superior
 to others (seyyo' ham asmi-maana); I am equal to others (sadiso 'ham asmi-maana
); I am inferior to others (hino 'ham asmi maana).
 Maana is one of the fetters that bind man to the ills of existence, and
 it varies from a crude feeling of pride to a subtle feeling of distinctiveness
 that prevails till the attainment of arahantship (sainthood).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a person is proud of his attainments, exaggerates them, and feels infuriated
 when someone gives a lower estimation of his doings, he suffers from an
 inflated sense of vanity (maana mada).
 If he feels frustrated, disappointed and underestimates his attainments
 he is subject to a kind of inferiority complex.
 This is similar to what Fromm describes as "depression." "The element of
 mourning in melancholia refers, in my opinion to the narcissistic image
 of the wonderful 'I' which has died, and for which the depressed person
 is mourning."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pride, vanity and conceit manifest clearly in interpersonal relations, as
 a reactive expression, as "wounded narcissism." Its mechanism is similar
 to what Freud refers to as "secondary narcissism." One's wounded narcissism
 gives way either to an ego collapse, depression and melancholy or to anger
 and fury.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Antinomy between Self-love and Love for Others
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from discussing the pathology of narcissism and its crippling impact
 on healthy personality growth, Fromm raises the question whether there
 could be a kind of healthy self-love, a benign form of narcissism as different
 from malignant narcissism.
 Is a certain degree of narcissism necessary for survival? Is there a necessary
 antinomy between love of self and others?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the problem could of course arise due to the linguistic issues besetting
 the use of the word "self" in diverse contexts.
 A grasp of the subtle mechanisms that bear upon the psychology of human
 motivation can clear up another facet of this issue.
 Ultimately this might involve a whole philosophical perspective or a way
 of looking at the universe and man.

Fromm's analysis of this question too can be presented against the background
 of the Buddhist analysis of the issues involved.
 The problem arises when we consider love for others and love for oneself
 as alternatives which are mutually exclusive.12 Selfishness is not identical
 with mature self-love.
 In fact selfishness is caused by a real lack of genuine self-love.
 "Love, in principle, is indivisible as far as the connection between the
 'objects' and one's own self is concerned.
 Genuine love is an expression of productiveness and implies care, respect,
 responsibility, and knowledge.
 It is not an 'affect' in the sense of being affected by somebody, but an
 active striving for the growth and happiness of the loved person, rooted
 in one's own capacity to love."13
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fromm says that it is only a "symbiotic attachment" which is rooted in one's
 narcissism.
 Symbiotic attachment takes two basic forms: that of passive submission
 (to use a clinical term, masochism), and active dominance (sadism).
 The masochistic person escapes from the unbearable feeling of separation
 and isolation by making himself a part and parcel of another person; the
 sadistic person wants to escape from his aloneness by making another person
 part and parcel of himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the Buddhist standpoint, a clear distinction could be made between
 self-devoting motives and self-centered motives.
 The practice of metta-bhaavanaa is the finest expression of the fusing
 of self-love and love for others in Buddhism.
 The meditation of loving-kindness is first developed towards oneself and
 then radiates towards others.
 One first starts with the thought, "May I be happy," and then extends it
 to the welfare and happiness of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even, where a person makes a sacrifice and forgoes certain material benefits
 for the sake of others, it merely strengthens his self-development.
 The very nature of the good is such that no one can seek the salvation
 of others without seeking his own.
 It is extremely important to mention that Buddhism considers the life of
 renunciation as the highest expression of the other-regarding instincts.
 This is very well expressed in the Kindred Sayings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He who of both is a physician, since Himself he healeth and the others too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the suttas, there is a classification of beings into four types: He who
 is neither bent on his own profit nor on the profit of another; he who
 is bent on the profit of another but not his own; he who is bent on his
 own profits not another's; and he who is bent on the profit both of himself
 and another.14 The Buddha considers the last category as the best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The context in which the Buddha made the analysis cited above may be a little
 different from the context in which Fromm has made a case for genuine self-love.
 But I do not see any fundamental difference between the approaches in Buddhism
 and that of Erich Fromm.
 It is true that the Buddha was basically concerned with the life of renunciatio
n, and the other-regarding virtues in Buddhism are based on a deeper doctrine
 of compassion.
 But if we present the basic human relations presented in a homily to Sigaala,
 it will be quite clear that even in limited social situations, the Buddha
 advocates mature human relations which deny any symbiotic attachment15
 of abnormal domination or dependence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is however a wider dimension in which the Buddhist analysis of self-love
 has to be presented.
 A layman who has made a necessary compromise with life will find it difficult
 to handle the obtruding ego, while the recluse committed to the path of
 renunciation will have at his command a more effective therapeutic control
 over the spell of narcissism.
 The only way to bridge the gap is to discover significant similarities
 between the techniques used by the psychiatrist in special "clinical situations
" and that the recluse who has made a life-long commitment to a therapeutic
 procedure of his own.

The "five groups" are a classification, in which the Buddha has summed up
 all the physical and mental phenomena of existence, and in particular,
 those which appear to the ignorant man as his ego, or personality.
 They are: corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousnes
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is said in the Visuddhi Magga: "Whenever different parts, as axle, wheels,
 frame, pole, etc., are combined in a certain manner, we use the conventional
 designation 'chariot.' But if we examine one part after the other, we cannot,
 in the ultimate sense, discover anything that can be called a chariot."
 It is likewise with the five groups of existence (khandha).
 If they are present, one uses the conventional designation "being" or "personal
ity," etc.
 But if we examine each phenomenon in its ultimate sense, there is nothing
 that can form a basis for such conceptions as "I am" and "I." Hence in the
 ultimate sense only mental and physical phenomena exist.

 is identical with the body, in that case there can be no holy life.
 And if one holds the view that life is one thing but body another thing,
 also in that case a holy life is impossible.
 Avoiding both of these extremes (i.e., complete identity and complete otherness),
 the Perfect One has taught the doctrine that lies in the middle, namely:
 Through rebirth conditioned are old age and death;...
 Through the (karmical) process of becoming, rebirth;...
 through clinging the process of becoming;...

Better it would be to consider the body as the "ego," rather than the mind.

 But that which is called "mind," "consciousness," "thinking," arises continuous
ly, during day and night, as one thing, and as something different again
 it vanishes.
 Now, here the learned and noble disciple considers thoroughly the Dependent
 Origination: If this is, then that becomes.
 Through the arising of this, that comes to arise; through the extinction
 of this, that becomes extinguished, namely: Through ignorance conditioned
 arise the karma-formations; through the karma-formations, consciousness

All beings who drift and circle in the long and beginningless round of rebirths
 called sa"msaara rarely encounter the teachings of a Buddha.
 They may not encounter them for the time of even a hundred thousand world-cycle
s.
 They may not get the opportunity of hearing of a Buddha's teachings even
 once while an infinite number of world-cycles elapse.
 The number of existences and world-cycles in which beings have been afflicted
 by evil and error predominate.
 Hence, in the mental make-up of a being, there is always an infinite number
 of unwholesome actions (akusala-kamma) that can result in its falling into
 a world of utmost torment (avici-niraya), or in being reborn in other worlds
 of woe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ego-delusion is the foremost of the unwholesome kamma of old and accompanies
 beings incessantly.
 As long as personality-belief exists, these old unwholesome actions are
 fiery and full of strength.
 Though beings may be enjoying happiness and splendour as deities, as divine
 rulers (Sakka) or in the fine-material or immaterial Brahma worlds, yet
 they necessarily exist, as it were, with their heads forever turned towards
 the four worlds of woe (apaaya).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Palm fruits in a palm grove have an ever-existing tendency to fall to the
 ground, even though they may be attached to the very top of a palm tree.
 So long as the stalks are firm the fruits will remain on the tree; but
 as soon as the stalks weaken they will inevitably fall to the ground.
 In the same way, deities and Brahma gods afflicted with ego-delusion will
 be able to exist in their respective worlds only as long as the "stalks"
 of vital life force as deities and Brahmas remain intact.
 But when these "stalks" of vital life force are severed, they inevitably
 fall into worlds below, just like the palm fruits.
 This happens because personality-belief, which is ever present in the mental
 make-up of a being, is a great burden — heavier than even the Mount Meru
 — inasmuch as personality-belief gathers in its fold an infinite number
 of unwholesome kamma accumulated in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus beings who harbor within themselves this personality-belief are continually
 under pressure to gradually descend or directly to fall towards the worlds
 of woe although they may be living in the highest of the Brahma worlds.
 The cases of beings living in the lower Brahma worlds or in the celestial
 or human world, are much worse and need no further comment.
 Although such beings may exist as the rulers of Brahma worlds or of celestial
 worlds, yet their mental makeup contains, ready-made, the eight great hells,
 the lesser hells, the worlds of ghosts and demons and the animal realm.
 It is because these beings do not know that the tendency towards those
 misery-filled lower realms is always present in their mental make-up, that
 the Brahma kings and divine kings can afford to derive pleasure and enjoyment
 from their form of existence.

\begin_layout Standard
But all the old unwholesome actions that have accompanied beings throughout
 the long and beginningless round of rebirths, will be extinguished completely
 when their head and chief, personality-belief (sakkaaya-di.t.thi), has been
 made to disappear entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from that old unwholesome kamma that had accompanied beings since
 time immemorial, even in the case of the numerous unwholesome actions committed
 in the present existence (such as killing or stealing), their (rebirth-producin
g) tendencies entirely disappear as soon as their head and chief, the personalit
y-belief, becomes completely extinguished.
 For such beings there may remain occasion to fear affliction by vermin,
 but there no longer remains any occasion for them to fear the resultants
 of the infinite number of past unwholesome actions.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beings whose mental make-up is entirely freed from personality-belief have,
 as it were, their heads turned towards the higher planes of the celestial
 and Brahma worlds even though they may be living in the human world.
 And if living in the lower celestial and Brahma realms, their heads are
 always turned towards the higher planes of those worlds.
 They resemble the vapors that invariably rise upwards from forests and
 mountains during the latter part of the rainy season.

 personality-belief as far as relating to past kamma.

Anattaa Realization and Future Kamma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human beings, deities and Brahmas, who have personality-belief in their
 mental make-up, may be good and virtuous beings today, but any time later
 they may commit an unlimited number of evil deeds, even grave offences
 like matricide, parricide, killing of arahants, etc.; and this may happen
 to them tomorrow or the day after, next month or next year, or in following
 existences.
 Today they may be devotees within the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation,
 while tomorrow or the day after, etc., they may be outside its pale or even
 become enemies and destroyers of the Buddha Saasana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those beings however, human or divine, who well perceive the characteristic
 of not-self (anattaa) and thus have entirely extirpated personality-belief
 from their mental make-up, will cease to commit evil deeds and other unwholesom
e kamma even in their dreams, although they may continue to circle in sa"msaara
 for many more lives to come.
 From the day of freeing themselves from personality-belief until their
 final existence before their attainment of Nibbaana, they will always remain
 within the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation, wherever they are reborn.
 They will never appear in a form of existence or in a world where the Buddha's
 Dispensation is absent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of
 personality-belief as far as relating to future kamma.

\begin_layout Standard
How Past Kamma Becomes Inoperative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past become inoperative2
 at the moment when personality-belief is extinguished, may be illustrated
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a string of beads where a great number of beads are strung together by
 a strong silk thread, if one bead is pulled all the others will follow
 the one that is pulled.
 But if the silk thread is cut or removed, pulling one of the beads will
 not disturb the other beads because there is no longer any attachment between
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, a being that possesses personality-belief harbors a strong attachment
 to the series of the aggregates (khandha) arisen during past existences
 and past world cycles, and transforms them into an ego.
 Thinking, "In the past I have often been a human being, a deity, or a Brahmaa,"
 he acquires the thread that is personality-belief.
 It is thus that the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past
 which have not yet produced resultants, will accompany that being wherever
 he may be reborn.
 These unwholesome actions of the past resemble beads that are strung and
 bound together by a strong thread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beings, however, who clearly perceive the characteristic of not-self and
 have rid themselves of personality-belief, will perceive that the bodily
 and mental aggregates that arise and disappear even within the short period
 of one sitting, do so as separate phenomena and not as a closely interlinked
 continuum.
 The concept of "my self" which is like the thread, is no longer present.
 Those bodily and mental processes appear to them like the beads from which
 the thread has been removed.
 They clearly perceive that the unwholesome actions of the past committed
 by them, are not "persons" nor "beings" not an "I" nor "my actions," but
 that they arise and disappear in an instant.
 That is why that past unwholesome kamma disappears as soon as personality-belie
f disappears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be known, however, that only unwholesome (akusala) kamma disappears.
 Wholesome (kusala) kamma of the past does not disappear through the mere
 disappearance of personality-belief.
 It is only when the stage of the path of sainthood (arahatta-magga) is
 reached and when craving (ta.nhaa) is completely eradicated that wholesome
 kamma of the past becomes inoperative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Evil of Personality Belief
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personality-belief is an evil that is extremely deep-rooted and far-reaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A person who commits an evil deed and thus becomes extremely agitated and
 worried over the prospect of being reborn in states of woe, transforms
 that evil deed of his into a "self" (attaa) and becomes greatly distressed
 by such firmly held thoughts as, "I have done wrong.
 I have gravely erred." But if that being fully comprehends and realizes
 the characteristic of not-self and thereby can abolish attachment to such
 thoughts as, "I have gravely erred," that kamma (unless it is a weighty
 one) will no longer have the power of producing resultants (in a future
 rebirth) so far as that being is concerned.
 But, generally, beings do not discard their attachment to such thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although that kamma does not, as it were, desire to accompany that being
 nor to produce resultants, yet it is forced to do so by the fact that being
 takes possession of it by harboring such thoughts as, "I myself have committed
 that deed.
 It is my kamma." Because of this forcible possessive act that kamma is obliged
 to produce its resultants.
 To this extent are beings possessing personality-belief deluded and erring
 in their ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the same in the case of unwholesome kamma of the past that remains
 operative.
 It is because of the forcible possessive act of personality-belief that
 this kamma accompanies beings throughout their samsaric wanderings and
 will produce its resultants in due course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beings find that they cannot discard their unwholesome actions though being
 oppressed by their resultants, and suffering great privations in the process.
 They think, "I have committed those evil deeds," and thus (identifying
 themselves with them) they take, as it were, possession of them.
 Thus these unwholesome actions cannot help to produce resultants and continue
 to do so, disabling those beings to achieve release.
 To this extent, personality-belief is profoundly evil and erroneous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beings are very much afraid of the dangers of disease, old age, and death.
 But, through harboring such fear, they become attached to the past incidents
 of disease, old age, and death by identifying themselves with those experiences
 in the thought, "For a long time in the past I have suffered these ills."
 Thus they find it impossible to relinquish even such fearsome phenomena.
 Hence these phenomena of disease, old age, and death continue to accompany
 them, as it were, against their own will, and continue to cause oppression.
 To this extent, too, is personality-belief profoundly evil and erroneous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this present existence, too, when external and internal dangers are encounter
ed or disease and ailments occur, beings attach themselves to them through
 such thoughts as, "I feel pain; I feel hurt," and thus take a possessive
 attitude towards them.
 This becomes an act of bondage that later may obstruct beings from ridding
 themselves of those diseases, ailments, and dangers.
 Because this bondage through personality-belief is so strong, beings have
 often found those diseases, ailments, or dangers to be their inseparable
 companions through many existences up to the present day.
 Thus, personality creates a possessive attachment even to diseases, ailments,
 and dangers though these are so greatly oppressive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also fears of encountering disease, ailments, and dangers in future, will
 produce such a bondage.
 And as long as there is personality-belief, beings will certainly meet
 such eventualities also in future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a brief description of how personality-belief is profoundly evil
 and erroneous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Superficial and Deep Attachment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attachments of craving (ta.nhaa) and conceit (maana) are not necessarily
 attachments of wrong views (di.t.thi).
 Craving develops an attachment for all the (physical and mental) phenomena
 in the three spheres of existence, in the form, "It is my property." Conceit
 develops a proud attachment for them in the form, "It is I who owns it"
 or "It is I who has those great qualities." In the case of beings who have
 personality-belief, craving and conceit follow the lead given by personality-be
lief.
 In the case of stream-winners, once-returners, and non-returners who have
 eliminated personality-belief, craving and conceit follow the distortion
 of perception (sa~n~naa-vipallaasa) and the distortion of consciousness
 (citta-vipallaasa).
 The attachments produced by these distortions are superficial; but those
 produced by personality-belief are deep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ends the description how unwholesome actions of the past totally cease
 with the disappearance of personality-belief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.This means that the unwholesome actions of the past can no longer generate
 a new rebirth, though they might cause resultants (vipaaka) to appear in

"How is it, lord, that the Exalted One gave no answer to the question of

The Search for a Self or Soul
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chas.
 F.
 Knight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Sa"muytta-Nikaaya is the story of Vacchagotta the Wanderer, the man
 who was concerned with the existence or non-existence of his "self."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Digha-Nikaaya is the story of Po.t.thapaada, an inveterate asker of
 questions, in search of a "soul."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is of interest to note the different response these two inquirers received
 from the Buddha.
 Vacchagotta's questions remained unanswered, while Po.t.thapaada's doctrinal
 questions were discussed and answered in full.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these inquirers have their counterparts in the West today — those
 who are concerned with a "self," and those who are concerned with a "soul."
 While the two terms self and soul are often used as synonyms and interchangeabl
e, I think that those who use them in reference to themselves have a differentia
l conception of the two words.
 The seeker for a "self" is more concerned with the preservation of his
 ego in the here and now, whereas the would-be possessor of a "soul" is
 perturbed as to survival after death.
 It is empiric that the protagonists of the self theory, or concept, are
 by nature extrovert and egotistic.
 On the other hand, those who most ardently cling to the soul concept, are
 less concerned with asserting themselves before others, but are concerned
 mainly with their inmost nature — natural introverts.
 Yet these too in their quiet way are also egotistical, in that they desire
 to preserve their "identity."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Asian Buddhist world unanimously accepts and adheres to the doctrine
 of anatta — the absence of an abiding and stable entity — it is by no means
 uncommon to find nominal "Buddhists" in the West who are unable to shake
 off 2000 years of indoctrination of the "soul" concept, and, as a consequence,
 bring to their "Buddhism" preconceived views, often bolstered up by a syncretic
 admixture of other Indian beliefs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The story of Vacchagotta precedes this article.
 His questions are akin to asking a man if he has stopped beating his wife.
 The man may have not have lifted his hand against her at any time, but
 if he answers "Yes," the inference is that he had previously beaten her.
 If he answers "No," the inference is that he still beats her.
 Had the Buddha agreed that Vacchagotta had a self, for the Buddha did not
 deny the existence of phenomenon, Vacchagotta could have taken it as a
 confirmation of the brahmin belief in an eternal atman, or spark of the
 Divine to survive after death.
 Had the Buddha agreed that there was not a "self" in the ultimate sense,
 Vacchagotta could have taken the reply as an endorsement of the view held
 by the annihilationists — that nothing survived after death.
 Vacchagotta was not asking questions idly, but this was an occasion on
 which confusion could have arisen, and so the Buddha maintained the noble
 silence and left Vacchagotta to ponder further on the point that was bothering
 him.
 He still had not grasped the higher truths of karma and aniccaa under which
 the conventional "self" is but a momentary manifestation of ever-changing
 components to be cast aside at death, and without a stable entity to be
 carried forward to a new birth.
 Later, Vacchagotta did grasp these truths, and he finally became one of
 the arahants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who are fond of quoting this dialogue between the Buddha and Vacchagotta
 to support their theory of a soul seldom, if ever, go on to the Buddha's
 final explanation to Aananda which closes the passage, and which, incidentally
 displays one of those flashes of the Buddha's humor that peeps out here
 and there in his dealings with inquirers.
 It would be stretching the argument beyond reason to presume that the Buddha
 was not capable or not inclined to make an assertion on the "soul" if it
 really existed, in the light of his many expositions of its non-existence.
 The commentator, Kumaralabdha, quoted by Dr.
 Malalasekera in the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, puts it in a nutshell:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there was an "atta" (soul), what on earth was there to prevent the Buddha
 from saying so?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our purpose we can dismiss the "self" seekers, for while they insist
 on having a "self" to satisfy their ego, many of them give at least lip-service
 to the anattaa doctrine.
 They have their "self" that thinks, writes, or teaches, to present to the
 world.
 They have their "self" that strives to lift the "self" still higher in
 man's estimation, till it equals or becomes part of the "SELF," and some
 go on to the "Overself," or Godhead by another name.
 These people see themselves as gods in the making, and their word is final
 — so far as they are concerned.
 Their concepts are usually derived via Theosophy from pre-Buddhistic Brahmanism
, even though they may call themselves "Buddhists." Brahman, the First Cause,
 or Great SELF, was personified as Brahma the Creator, the Self, and all
 beings were, or had in them, a spark of the Divine, a lesser self, which
 was still essentially of the same substance as the Great SELF, to which
 it eventually returned when purified by rites and ceremonies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the question of a "soul," Po.t.thapaada and his friends were discussing
 the importance of consciousness, its arising and its ceasing.
 One had put forward the theory that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"States of consciousness come to a man without reason and without a cause,
 and so also do they pass away.
 At the time when they spring up in him, then he becomes conscious."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was rejected by a second speaker who protested:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That, sirs, will never be as you say.
 Consciousness, sirs, is a man's soul (attaa).
 It is the soul that comes and goes.
 When the soul comes into a man, then he becomes conscious; when the soul
 goes away out of a man, he becomes unconscious."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seeing the Buddha approaching they decided to ask his opinion on the matter,
 and Po.t.thapaada outlines the pith of their discussion and the various arguments
 that have been put forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha refuted the former view by stating that it was precisely through
 a reason, by means of a cause, that states of consciousness come and go.
 "By training some states of consciousness arise.
 By training others pass away." Through training one sort of consciousness
 arises, and through training another passes away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha illustrates his meaning by a lengthy discourse on training, showing
 the causal origination of consciousness as a consequence.
 He then goes on to the cessation of consciousness dependent on the cessation
 of ideas as the adept in meditative practices achieves the various trance
 states of the jhaanas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"To him neither thinking anymore, nor fancying the ideas, the states of
 consciousness he had pass away, and no others, coarser than they, arise.
 So he enters in jhaana.
 Thus it is, Po.t.thapaada, that the attainment of the cessation of conscious
 ideas takes place step by step."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first proposition of the independent arising of ideas leading to consciousne
ss having thus been disposed of by the Buddha, Po.t.thapaada admits to not
 having heard this explained before, "but I now understand what you say."
 He then proceeds to the second opinion that had been expressed by his fellow
 mendicants:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is then, Sir, the consciousness identical with a man's soul, or is consciousnes
s one thing and the soul another?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But what then, Po.t.thapaada? Do you really fall back on the soul?" queries
 the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Po.t.thapaada replies that he takes for granted the existence of a soul of
 some kind.
 Maybe a material soul, he suggests tentatively, but without much conviction.
 Failing that, what about a soul the exact copy of the body, but so subtle
 in texture that it could only be described as being "made of mind." No?
 Well then a soul without form, and made of consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To all of these suggestions the Buddha has but one reply.
 Suppose you did have a soul conforming to any of these descriptions, still
 some ideas, some states of consciousness, would arise to the man, and others
 would pass away, so "you can see how consciousness must be one thing, and
 the soul would be another."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However Po.t.thapaada was still not convinced that he was totally lacking
 in a soul.
 On that point he had a closed mind as is shown by his next question.
 He does not ask: "Is there, or is there not, a soul?," but is it possible
 for him to ever understand what the soul is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is it possible for me to understand whether consciousness is the man's
 soul, or is the one different from the other?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha's reply to Po.t.thapaada is equally applicable to the "soul-seekers"
 of today; those who accept the Buddha's teachings with reservations — the
 right to reject what does not fit in with their preconceived notions, beliefs,
 and views.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hard it is for you, Po.t.thapaada, holding as you do different views, other
 things approving themselves to you, setting different aims before yourself,
 striving after a different perfection, trained in a different system of
 doctrine, to grasp this matter."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Po.t.thapaada abandons his search for a definition of his soul, to which he
 still clings, and changes the subject by propounding ten questions on the
 imponderables.
 The Buddha bears patiently with him, and in answer to each question replies
 it is not a matter on which he had expressed an opinion, for such questions
 were not calculated to profit, were not concerned with his Dhamma, nor
 to the attainment of Nirvana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Po.t.thapaada has not exhausted his propensity for asking questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Then what is it that the Exalted One has determined?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I have expounded what Dukkha is; I have expounded what is its origin; I
 have expounded what is the cessation of Dukkha; I have expounded what is
 the method by which one may reach the cessation of Dukkha."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha departed with dignity, while Po.t.thapaada was subjected to the
 jeers and sarcasm of his fellow mendicants for having failed to obtain
 the answers to his later questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worthy of note that to the doctrinal questions the Buddha gave serious
 and ample replies, sufficient to remove any reasonable grounds for differing
 from the Dhamma he taught, but he refused to be drawn into any discussion
 that could not lead to finality, such matters being outside of the Dhamma
 taught by him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught his doctrine of "soullessness" — anattaa — in two ways,
 and by two methods demonstrated its truth and necessity if the major purpose
 of his teachings was to be accomplished — the cessation of Dukkha.
 One was by the analysis of constituents of "personality," the other was
 that any belief in a permanent "self" would conflict with the causal law,
 and so deny the possibility of escape from the wheel of becoming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In regard to the analysis of personality, there are so many passages that
 deal with this method that lack of space prevents more than a passing mention
 of them.
 Those who wish to clarify their thinking on this point will have no difficulty
 in finding them.
 The most common formula is to proceed with those who regard body as the
 self, or the self as being in the body; so with feelings, with perception,
 with activities, with consciousness.
 Such ones become obsessed with the idea, "I am the body.
 The body is mine," or "I feel, I perceive, or there are activities, I am
 conscious." "Feeling is mine, perception is mine, activities are mine, conscious
ness is mine." But when these change and alter, owing to their unstable nature,
 then arises sorrow, woe, and grief, due to their impermanence and instability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In SN 3.147, prior to an analysis as above, a certain one asked of the Buddha:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Pray, Lord, is there any body, feeling, perception, activity, or consciousness
 that is permanent, stable by nature, lasting, unchanging, like unto the
 eternal, so that it will stand fast?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the Exalted One took up a pinch of dust on the tip of his nail, and
 said to that brother:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Even thus much material form, brother, is not permanent, stable, eternal,
 by nature unchanging, like unto the eternal, so that it will stand fast.
 If even thus much material form, brother, were permanent unchanging, then
 the living of the holy life for the utter destruction of suffering would
 not be set forth.
 But inasmuch as even thus much material form, brother, is not permanent,
 stable, eternal, by nature unchanging, therefore the living of the holy
 life for the utter destruction of suffering is set forth."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 3.147
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have on previous occasions written that no one doctrine taught by the
 Buddha stands in isolation from any other or all of them.
 The Buddha's reply to Po.t.thapaada quoted above as to what he expounded
 is the key to them all, and the connecting link between them — Dukkha,
 its origin, its cessation, and the way to its cessation — was the Buddha's
 only concern.
 All his doctrinal dissertations climaxed in moral perfection as the way
 to Dukkha's ceasing.
 The purpose of the analysis in expounding the anatta doctrine is to understand
 the functioning and the impermanence of the five aggregates that constitute
 the phenomenal "person." If this be accomplished, the major delusion of
 a "self" that obsesses mankind generally will be eliminated.
 With the elimination of this illusory "self," the root-cause of our unhappiness
 is eliminated.
 The eternal thirst to satisfy its demands, the grasping after sense-pleasures
 to please it, the clinging to phenomena that must fade and die, is the
 source of Dukkha.
 So the doctrine of Anattaa becomes a coordinating link with all other doctrines
 leading to the ethical life, and sorrow's ending.

 of a succession of periods so occurring that, but for a brief space of
 time, nothing of that which had been one's sustaining force continued to
 exist at all in that which followed it.
 I saw human life as a complex from which the support of an individual,
 identical, and permanent 'self' was so conspicuously absent, was something
 so useless for the future, so far extended into the past, that death might
 just as well intervene at this point or that; because it could never mark

 The discarded light bulb has not been able to take along the life that
 flowed through it to its final resting place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with our life.
 It is one and indivisible although its ever changing forms are innumerable
 and perishable.
 There is in truth no death although every form must die.
 We cannot permanently possess the life that flows through us any more than
 the electric light bulb can own the current that gave it light.
 Life alone is continuous ever seeking self-expression in new forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with what we call the soul.
 There is no substantial categorical entity as a soul which belongs to us,
 and only to us, in death as it did in life.
 A human individual is composed of psychological elements and a physical
 body.
 It is consciousness which unifies the individual.
 This relationship between consciousness and the psycho-physical existence
 often gives rise to the egocentric belief that we possess an immortal unchangin
g soul, the destiny of which may be eternal happiness or eternal misery
 according to the deeds of the personality it inhabits.
 Unfortunately this idea is so deep-rooted in Western man, so near and dear
 to him that he naturally experiences great difficulty in understanding
 any teaching contrary to this established notion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence
 of such a separative soul, self or aatman.
 According to the teachings of the Buddha, the idea of self is an imaginary
 false belief which has no corresponding reality and produces harmful thoughts
 of "me" and "mine." Buddhism insists that the soul is not a rigid unchanging
 entity but a living evolving organism.
 The soul, as Buddhists understand it, is an ever growing, changing bundle
 of attributes or characteristics, forming our character and personality.
 All of these manifested things, when analyzed are found to lack continuous
 form or unchanging substance.
 In reality there is nothing infinite apart from finite things.
 Whatever exists is in a constant state of flux, through and through, like
 the flame of the lamp, and all existence is in a process which continues
 to constantly renew itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our mind and its thoughts is essentially a stream of consciousness.
 Thought, however, is not simply a physiological function but a kind of
 energy, something like electricity.
 We should therefore strive to translate and activate this thought energy
 in the world we live in, the life we live, in this existence where the
 illusion of the separative self and the unchanging permanent soul can be
 forever eliminated, no longer causing us to cling to forms that lack reality
 and substance.
 The bonds of selfhood are then broken.
 New vistas appear before us.
 A clearer unclouded understanding of the living forces of life is now ours.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Introductory Note
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saantaraksita (also called Saantiraksita) was born in a royal family in
 India, in the 8th century C.E.
 He was one of the greatest Buddhist philosophers of his time and a chancellor
 of the famous Naalanda University.
 His main opus, the Tattva-Sa"mgraha, is a monumental work of philosophical
 criticism, comprising no less than 3,646 stanzas.
 A very voluminous commentary on it, written by his pupil Kamalasila, is
 likewise a work of great philosophical and critical acumen.
 Both stanzas and commentary are extant in their Sanskrit original (discovered
 by G.
 Buehler in 1873) and in a Tibetan translation.
 The Sanskrit text of both, in Devanaagari script, was published in 1929
 in the Gaekward's Oriental Series, in two volumes.
 In the same series a complete English translation of stanzas and commentary
 by Dr.
 Ganganath Jha, appeared in 1937 and 1939, likewise in two volumes of together
 1,613 pages.
 The following extracts have been taken from that translation, with some
 necessary changes, chiefly in Buddhist terminology, which were made after
 consulting the Sanskrit original.
 A few more extracts had been published earlier in Buddhism and God Idea
 (The Wheel No.
 47).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is difficult to identify Saantaraksita's philosophical position with
 any of the contemporary schools since his work shows features of Madhyamika,
 Vij~naa.navaada as well as Sautrantika thought (the latter being a so-called
 Hinayaana school).
 Probably Saantaraksita took an independent and eclectic position of his
 own.
 His work and thought is still in need of careful research before it can
 be evaluated as it deserves it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saantaraksita's life had also an active side: together with Padmasambhava,
 he founded the first monastery in Tibet, Samye, and had visited Tibet once
 before.

\begin_layout Standard
Commentary.
 The doctrine of No-soul (nairaatmya) is called the Gateway to the Highest
 Good because it is the means of entering Nirvana; it is Nirvana that is
 meant by the term "Highest Good" (sivam).
 This doctrine causes fright (bhayankaram) in those who uphold wrong beliefs,
 as for instance the soul-belief (aatma-drs.ti), and are attached to unrealistic
 views.
 As it was said, "The foolish man is always beset with such fears as 'I
 am not, I may cease to exist, naught is mine, nothing shall be mine'; but
 in the wise (such) fear has ceased."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commentary.
 — It is, indeed, omniscience that follows from the removal of the hindrance
 (caused) by the defilements and by cognizable things (kles'a-j~neyaavara.na).
 It is because these very defilements, i.e., greed, hate, etc., obstruct an
 understanding of the real nature of things, that one speaks of the hindrance
 consisting in the defilements.
 Though things are perceived, the lack of capacity to discern them in all
 their aspects as to whether they are to be rejected or accepted, and also
 the incapacity to conduct oneself (in accordance with that discernment)
 — this is the hindrance in regard to cognizables.
 Of these two, the hindrance caused by defilements is removed by the direct
 experience (or confrontation; pratyaksaakara.na) of Soullessness (nairaatmya).
 The hindrance in regard to cognizables is removed by the dedicated, constant
 and long-continued absorption of that very doctrine of Soullessness.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these defilements as greed, hatred and the rest, have their root in
 the wrong notion of a soul (or self).
 They do not arise from external things; because, even, when the external
 thing is there the said defilements will not appear without unwise attention
 to them (ayonisau-manascchaaskaaram; Pali: ayoniso manasikaara); and conversely
, even when there is no external thing, the defilements will appear when
 there is a (mental) confrontation with unwise imaginings.
 Thus, when presence and absence of one thing do not follow the presence
 and absence of another, the latter cannot be the cause of the former; if
 it were so, there would be incongruities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defilements really proceed from the unrealistic notion of a self (Soul).
 For instance, unless one seizes upon the notion of "I," one cannot have
 self-love.
 Nor can love arise for objects taken as self or self's property, unless
 one seizes upon the notion of "mine" and on what is conducive to the arising
 of pleasure to oneself.
 Likewise, hatred towards anything does not appear unless one seizes upon
 objects as being repulsive (and hostile) to (what one takes to be) one's
 self and self's property because there cannot be hatred against what is
 not harmful to one's self and its property, nor against what removes that
 harm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From all this it is clear that it is the notion of a soul or self, produced
 from time beginningless by a repeated habituation to one's (varying) nature,
 which generates the grip on (what is regarded as) self's property.
 These two produce self-love, which again generates hate and other defilements.
 From this concatenation it is abundantly clear that the defilements have
 their root in the clinging to self and its property originating from an
 excessive habituation to the notion of a self or soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrary to this idea of soul or self is the idea of no-soul or not-self,
 because the latter rests upon a mode (of thinking) quite the reverse of
 the former.
 It is incompatible too that both these ideas — of Soul and No-soul — should
 be identical or co-exist in the same (thought-) continuity; because they
 are as contrary to each other as the notions of "serpent" and "rope" applied
 to the same object.
 Thus the doctrine of No-soul being contrary to the doctrine of Soul, it
 becomes contrary to — incompatible with — the defilements, too, i.e.
 greed, hatred and the rest.
 Consequently, when the doctrine of No-soul, being incompatible with all
 defects and aberrations, has been directly experienced, then its contrary
 — i.e., the whole host of defilements as greed, etc.
 — cannot obtain any footing; just as darkness ceases in a place flooded
 with light.
 It is in that way that the hindrance caused by defilements is eliminated
 by the realization of the doctrine of No-soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if it were impossible for the idea of No-soul to appear in the (thought-)
 continuity of a man whose defilements have not been destroyed, then there
 would be no room at all for the arising of an understanding of No-soul.
 It is however, a matter of common experience that the idea of No-soul presents
 itself before all men.
 And if it is meditated upon it is capable of reaching great intensity,
 just as the (lustful) thought about a young woman.
 Subsequently it becomes as obvious as if one were to observe a directly
 perceived thing.
 How then can it be impossible for the idea of No-soul to arise in the minds
 of men?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The host of defilements, even in their most blatant forms, are unable to
 shake the strength of the doctrine of No-Soul.
 Because being due to adventitious causes, the defilements are never very
 firm.
 On the other hand, as to the idea of No-Soul, it forms the very nature
 of things and is also helped by the means of cognition (pramaa.na); hence
 it is strong and firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been argued that even for those who have cognised the doctrine of
 No-Soul through inference (anumaana), the defilements, as greed etc., do
 appear.
 — But this (objection) is not conclusive; because it is the knowledge acquired
 by meditation (bhaavanaa-maya) which, through its clarity and distinctness,
 directly envisages soul-less (impersonal) things in a non-conceptual way;
 and having as its object well-ascertained things, it is not erroneous.
 It is such an understanding of No-Soul that can entirely uproot the notion
 of a Soul (or Self) and has, on that account, been described (in the stanza
 commented upon) as being opposed to it.
 This knowledge is not of the kind derived from study and reflective thought
 (s'ruta-cintaa-maya).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the realization of the Soullessness of all things as proclaimed by
 him, follows the cessation of the entire flood of defilements which originated
 from personality-belief.
 It is from the view-point of a self and self's property that the notion
 of a "being" proceeds.
 From the conceit of "I" and "Mine" all defilements come forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This realization of No-Soul is inimical to the view of an (abiding) "being."
 When the habitual notions of a self and self's property have been eliminated
 by the former, the latter, too, disappears.
 The accumulation of defilements rooted in it, will vanish when their cause
 is absent: And if the defilements are absent, there will be no further
 rebirth being caused by them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There being absolute liberation from birth, this state is spoken of as the
 Final Goal.
 Thus the perception of No-Soul is the door to the Unrivalled Good.
 All other philosophers have held that Liberation follows from the cessation
 of egotism (aha"mkaara).
 But if there is a Soul, this egotism can never cease, Because its efficient
 cause would always be there; so the objective of that cause would not be
 abrogated.
 If it were abrogated, there would be a negation of it, which would mean
 a complete volte-face on their part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— stanzas 3488-3494
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commentary.
 It is accepted that liberation consists in the absolute cessation of the
 series of rebirths.
 But the only means of attaining this consists in the teachings of the Blessed
 Lord, as it is only here, and nowhere else, that we have the doctrine of
 No-Soul, which is the sole destroyer of defilements that are the source
 of rebirth.
 All other philosophers are wedded to the false doctrine of a Soul.
 Thus it is the word of the Blessed Lord alone which, as being the means
 of obtaining the highest good, can be the indicator of Dharma; hence it
 is this teaching alone that should be depended upon by all who seek their
 own welfare.
 — Such is the purport of the whole text...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be argued that "the Yogin does abrogate it." But if the Soul were
 to be abrogated, it could be repudiated only in the words "it does not
 exist," as otherwise there would be no point in repudiating it.
 Because if, after having accepted the concept of a Soul, one were to repudiate
 it as the "source of pain," then such repudiation would be useless, because
 the repudiation of a thing is done for the purpose of abandoning it; and
 no abandoning would be possible of what one regards as being one's ever-lasting
 Self; hence that repudiation would be useless.
 Nor can those other philosophers repudiate the Soul as being non-existent;
 because, having regarded it as existent, if they now regard it as non-existent,
 this would mean a complete volte-face on their part.

Derivation and Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Etymologically anattaa (adj.
 or n.) consists of the negative prefix an- plus attaa (cf.
 Vedic Sanskrit aatman).
 There are two main Pali forms of the word, namely, attaa (instr.
 attanaa) and atta (instr.
 attena).
 Neither form seems to be used in the plural in the Tipi.taka, the singular
 form being used with a plural verb subject.
 There is also a rare subsidiary form, namely, atumo (e.g., Sn.
 782; Nd 1, 60; A.
 III, 99/1, 249 (appaatumo) and tumo (e.g., Sn.
 890).

Attaa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first two senses of attaa distinguished above may be assumed to have
 been ordinary usage and no subject of disagreement between the Buddha and
 his opponents (se D.
 9, cited below).
 The last two are of minor import and need not concern us beyond noting
 them.
 The characteristic of Not-self (anatta-lakkha.na) deals with the third,
 the unidentifiable entity that is conceived and sought and made the subject
 of a certain class of views, namely, self-views (attaanudi.t.thi).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many suttas classify the conflicting notions of the nature of self held
 by opponents of the Buddha.
 It could be, and apparently was, for instance, claimed that it had materiality,
 or was immaterial; or both, or neither; was percipient of oneness, or of
 plurality, or of the limited or of the measureless; was eternal, or uneternal,
 or both, or neither; had only pleasure, or only pain, or both or neither;
 each of these theories being maintained by its propounder as "the only
 truth and all else wrong" (M.
 102, etc.).
 Or else it could be described as having materiality either limited or infinite,
 or as immaterial and either limited or infinite.
 And then whichever of these four is adopted, it may be seen as such now,
 or due to be such (upon rebirth), or in this way "Though it is not yet
 real, still I shall contrive for its reality" (D.
 15/vol.
 ii.
 64).
 All these rationalized views (di.t.thi) stem from uncritical acceptance or
 overlooking of an underlying tendency (anusaya), or fetter (sa"myo jana)
 — a natural predisposition — to regard, to identify, some aspect or other,
 in the situation of perceiving a percept, as "this is mine" or "this is
 what I am" or "this is my self" (e.g.
 M.
 22).
 These two levels — the self-view and the I-sense — are respectively what
 are called the "(lower or immediate) fetter of views" (di.t.thi-sa"myo jana)
 and the "(higher or remoter) fetter of conceit" (maana-sa"myo jana).
 The first is abandoned with the attainment of the first stage of realization
 (the path of stream-entry) while the second is abandoned only with the
 fourth and final stage (the path of arahantship: see D.
 33).
 It may be noted here in parenthesis that the rendering of maana by "pride,"
 though not wrong, severs the semantic relationship with ma~n~nati and ma~n~nana
a, which it is most important to preserve intact for the understanding of
 this situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overlooked fundamental conceit "I am" (asmi-maana) — a mirage that,
 in the act of perceiving, is conceived will fulfil its counterpart, the
 intuitive sense of lack, which is craving — in the basic ontological structure
 of ordinary perception provokes the ordinary man with no knowledge of the
 Buddha's teaching to indulge in uncritical speculation about what this
 may be that "I am," and consequently to build up self-theories.
 He perceives (sa~njaanaati): but the very act of his perceiving is tendentious
 so that he simultaneously conceives (ma~n~nati) his percepts with an I-tendency.
 But a stream-enterer, who has attained the first stage of realization,
 has direct acquaintance (abhijanaati) where the ordinary man has perception,
 owing to which fact the former has the possibility of hastening his attainment
 of arahatship; and an arahant has no more conceivings (ma~n~nanaa) at all.
 So long as a man leaves intact this fundamental tendency to conceive in
 the very act of perceiving, accompanied by the tendency to formulate views,
 he will look for answers to the questions that these two tendencies together
 prompt him to ask, and he will invent them and try to prove them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This is how he gives unreasoned attention (ayoniso-manasikaara): 'Was I
 in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in
 the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future?
 Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall
 I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' Or
 else he is doubtful in himself about the presently arisen extent thus:
 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Whence will this creature have come?
 Whither will it be bound?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"When he gives unreasoned attention in this way one of the six kinds of
 view arises in him: the view 'A self exists for me' arises as true and
 established, or the view 'No self exists for me'...
 or the view 'I perceive self with self'...
 or the view 'I perceive not-self with self'...
 or the view 'I perceive self with not-self" arises in him as true and establish
ed; or else he has some such view as 'It is this my self that speaks and
 feels and that experiences here and there the ripening of good and bad
 actions; but this my self is permanent, ever lasting, eternal, not subject
 to change, and it will endure as long as eternity.' This field of views
 is called the thicket of views, the wilderness of views, the vacillation
 of views, the fetter of views.
 No untaught ordinary man bound by the fetter of views is freed from birth,
 aging and death, from sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief, and despair:
 he is not freed from suffering, I say."

\begin_layout Standard
In assuming that "I was" etc.
 cannot be analyzed, all these philosophical systems attempt to settle with
 unilateral certainty the dialectic questions "what was I?" and the rest
 and to dispose of them on an inadequate ontological basis of self-identity
 without querying how the questions come to be put in the first place or
 what is the structural nature of being.
 But any one answer, "I am this" cannot as it happens be decisively established
 over its contrary opposite, though it can be fortified by arguments, more
 or less logical or emotional, introducing "my self" and defining relations
 between it and what it is considered not to be, endowing it then with certain
 qualities and values and with either eternal or temporary permanence according
 to bent.
 The impossibility of establishing absolutely any one of these views as
 the only truth may lead to abuse and even to violence in the end, since
 it is often thought important to be right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pre-rational conceit "I am" (asmi-maana) is a "fetter but not a view"
 (Ps.
 Di.t.thikathaa/vol.
 i, 143).
 To perceive is to recognize and identify (see Vis.
 Ch.
 XIV/p.
 462).
 In perceiving a percept the "untaught ordinary man" automatically conceives
 in the positional terms of "I," which then must seem involved in an I-relations
hip to the percept: either as identical with it, or as contained in it or
 as separate from it, or owning it as "mine." That relationship so conceived
 is relished (favored and approved) through want of full knowledge of the
 situation (M.
 1; cf.
 M.
 49).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rational self-view (attaanudi.t.thi) is both a "fetter and a view." Though
 the conceit "I am" is normally associated with the tendency to formulate
 views, these views need not by any means be definitely formulated; but
 whenever they are, none can be specifically described without reference
 to the five categories affected by clinging (upaadanakkhandha: see S.
 XXII, 47 cited below).
 For that reason they can all be reduced to one of the types of what is
 called the "embodiment view" (sakkaya-di.tthi, from sat (or sa"m) plus kaaya
 = "true (or existent) body") which is set up schematically as follows:
 "The untaught ordinary man who disregards the ariyas...
 sees materiality (ruupa) as self, or self as possessed of materiality,
 or materiality in self, or self in materiality.
 [And likewise with feeling (vedanaa), perception (sa~n~naa), formations
 (sankhaaraa), and consciousness (vi~n~naana]" (M.
 44/vol.
 i, 300).
 These four self-identifications embracing the five categories make twenty
 types.
 For each of the four basic modes of identifying, the Pa.tisambhidaamagga
 gives a simile as follows:

Self so viewed is then taken either as eternal thus "This is self, this
 the world; after death I shall be permanent, ever-lasting..." (M.
 22 cited below) or as temporarily permanent but eventually annihilated,
 for instance; thus "As soon as this self is annihilated...
 that is peace..." (Iti, II.

 All possible views of whatever shade are again classified under sixty-two
 types in the first Sutta of the Diigha-Nikaaya called Brahmajaala Sutta

Now all these views — and all these standpoints for views (di.t.thi.t.thana)
 — are formed (or conditioned; sankhata) because "it is impossible that
 anyone shall experience (them) apart from contact (phassa)...
 and with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving
 (ta.nhaa); with craving as condition, clinging (upaadaana); with clinging
 as condition, being (bhava); with being as condition, birth; with birth
 as condition aging and death come to be, and also sorrow and lamentation,
 pain, grief and despair; that is how there is an origin to this whole aggregate
-mass of suffering" (D.
 1/vol.
 i, 43-5).
 The structure of the conceit "I am" and the views to which it gives rise,
 is, in fact nothing else than the structure of being, the structure of
 what is "impermanent, formed, and dependently originated." "A Tathaagata
 understands that thus '(These views) are formed and (consequently) gross;
 but there is cessation of formations: there is that.' By knowing and seeing
 the escape from them a Tathaagata transcends them (tad upaativatto)" (M.

The Buddha explains how he uses the word attaa (self) in the second sense,
 namely, the "person" or "individual" noted above:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"There are these three kinds of acquisition of self (atta-patilaabha): gross,
 constituted of mind, and immaterial...
 The first has materiality and consists of the four great entities (elements
 of earth, water, fire, and air), and consumes physical food; the second
 is constituted by mind with all the limbs and lacking no faculty; the third
 consists of perception...
 I teach the Doctrine (dhamma) for the abandoning of acquisitions of self
 in order that in you, who put the teaching into practice, defiling ideas
 may be abandoned and cleansing ideas increase, and that you, by realization
 yourselves here and now with direct knowledge, enter upon and abide in
 the fullness of understanding's perfection...
 If it is thought that to do that is an unpleasant abiding, that is not
 so: on the contrary, by doing that there is gladness, happiness, tranquillity,
 mindfulness, full awareness and a pleasant (blissful) abiding...
 These are worldly usages, worldly language, worldly terms of communication,
 worldly descriptions by which a Tathaagata communicates without misapprehending
 them."

The first discourse given by the Buddha after his Enlightenment set out
 the Four Noble Truths.
 The second stated the characteristic of Not-self as follows: "Bhikkhus,
 materiality is not self.
 Were materiality self, then this materiality would not lead to affliction,
 and one could have it of materiality 'Let my materiality be thus, let my
 materiality be not thus.' And it is because materiality is not self that
 materiality leads to affliction and one cannot have it of materiality 'Let
 my materiality be thus, let my materiality be not thus' (And similarly
 with feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness)." The Buddha then
 continued:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How do you conceive this, bhikkhus, is materiality permanent or impermanent?"
 — "Impermanent, Lord." — "Is what is impermanent pleasure or pain?" — "Pain,
 Lord." — "Is what is impermanent, painful and subject to change fit to be
 seen thus 'This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self'?" — "No, Lord."
 (And similarly with the other four categories.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Consequently, bhikkhus, any kind of materiality (feeling, perception, formation
s, consciousness) whatever, whether past, future or presently arisen, in
 oneself or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near,
 is all (to be seen thus) 'This is not mine, this is not what I am, this
 is not my self.' That is how it should be seen with right understanding
 as it actually is."

The characteristic is stated more succinctly in this way: "The eye (ear,
 nose, tongue, body, and mind, and six external bases) is impermanent; what
 is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not self" (S.
 XXXV, 1/vol.
 iv, 1); or "All is not-self.
 And what is the all that is not self? The eye is not self..." (S.
 XXXV, 45/vol.
 iv, 28); or again "All things (dhamma) are not-self" (e.g.
 Dh.
 XX, 7/v.
 279).
 The canonical commentary, the Pa.tisambhidaamagga, adds "Materiality (etc.)
 is not-self in the sense that it has no core (saara)" (Ps.
 ~Naanakathaa/vol.
 i, 37).

Aacariya Buddhagohosa's definitions are as follows: "The characteristics
 of impermanence and suffering are known whether Buddhas arise or not; but
 that of not-self is not known unless there is a Buddha;...
 for the knowledge of it is the province of none but a Buddha" (Aayatana
 Vibhanga A./VbhA.
 49-50).
 "The Blessed One in some instances shows not-self-ness through impermanence
 (as in M.
 148 cited below), in some through suffering (as in S.
 XXII, 59 cited above), and in some through both (as in S.
 XXII, 76 or XXXV, 1 cited above).
 Why is that? While impermanence and suffering are both evident, not-self
 is unevident" (MA.
 ad M.
 22/vol.
 ii, 113); for "the characteristic of not-self seems unevident, obscure,
 arcane, impenetrable, hard to illustrate and hard to describe" (VbhA, 49).
 He distinguishes "the not-self and the characteristic of not-self...
 Those same five categories (which are impermanent and suffering) are not-self
 because of the words 'What is suffering is not self.' Why? Because there
 is no exercising mastery over them.
 The mode of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery (avasavattana)
 is the characteristic of not-self" (Vis.
 Ch.
 XXI/p.
 640).
 Again "(The eye) is not-self in the sense of insusceptibility to the exercise
 of mastery over it.
 Or alternatively, because there is no exercising of mastery over it in
 the following three instances, namely, 'Let it when arisen not reach presence'
 or 'Let it when already reached presence not age' or 'Let it when already
 reached aging not dissolve'; it is void of that mode of exercise of mastery,
 therefore it is not-self for four reasons: because it is void, because
 it has no owner, because it cannot be done with as one wants, and because
 it denies self" (VbhA.
 48; cf.
 MA.
 ii, 113).
 The Vibhaavini-Tiikaa (commentary to the Abhidhammattha-sangaha) says "Not-self
 is the absence (abhaava) of self as conjectured by other teachers; that
 not-self as a characteristic is the characteristic of not-self."

The Paramatthama~njuusaa further explains as follows,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Resolution of the compact" is effected by resolving (what appears compact)
 in this way "The earth element is one, the water element is another" and
 so on, distinguishing each one; and in this way "Contact is one, feeling
 is another" and so on, distinguishing each one, "When the resolution of
 the compact is effected" means that what is compact as a mass (samuuha)
 or as a function (kicca) or as a supporting object (aaramma.na) has been
 analysed.
 For when material and non-material dhammas have arisen mutually steadying
 each other (i.e., "name and form"), then, owing to misinterpreting (abhinivesa)
 that as a unity, compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject
 formations (sankhaaraa) to pressure.
 And likewise compactness of function is assumed when, although definite
 differences exist in such and such dhammas, functions, they are taken as
 one.
 And likewise compactness of supporting-object is assumed when, although
 differences exist in the ways in which dhammas that take supporting-objects
 make them so, those supporting-objects are taken as one.
 But when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into
 these elements, they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by
 the hand.
 They are mere dhammas occurring dependent on conditions and void.
 That is how the characteristic of not-self becomes more evident.

One discourse shows how the tendency to perceive in terms of "I" underlies
 theories of self:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Whatever sama.nas or brahma.nas see self in its various types, all of them
 see the five categories affected by clinging, on one or other of them.
 What five? Here an untaught ordinary man who disregards the ariyas, is
 unconversant with their teaching and undisciplined in it...
 sees materiality as self, or self as possessed of materiality, or materiality
 in self, or self in materiality; he sees feeling...
 perception...
 formations...
 consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or self in
 consciousness, or consciousness in self.
 So he has this way of seeing (samanupassanaa) and also this attitude (adhigata)
 'I am.' When there is the attitude 'I am' then there is the organization
 (avakkanti) of the five faculties (indriya) of eye, ear, nose, tongue,
 and body.
 There is mind (mano), and there are ideas (dhamma), and there is the element
 of ignorance (avijja-dhaatu).
 When an untaught ordinary man is touched by whatever is felt born of the
 contact of ignorance, it occurs to him 'I am' and 'I am this' and 'I shall
 be' and 'I shall not be' and 'I shall be formed' and 'I shall be formless'
 and 'I shall be percipient' and 'I shall be non-percipient' and 'I shall
 be neither percipient nor non-percipient.' Now in the case of the well-taught
 disciple of the ariyas, while the five faculties persist in the same way,
 nevertheless ignorance is abandoned and knowledge (vijjaa) arisen in him.
 With the fading out of ignorance and the arising of knowledge it no more
 occurs to him 'I am' and...
 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient.'"

 to these five categories affected by clinging, although I do not say 'I
 am this' (with respect to them)...
 I do not say 'I am materiality' or 'I am feeling' or 'I am perception'
 or 'I am formations' or 'I am consciousness,' nor do I say 'I am apart
 from consciousness'; yet I still have the attitude 'I am' with respect
 to the five categories affected by clinging, although I do not say 'I am
 this' (with respect to them).
 Although a disciple of the ariyas may have abandoned the five immediate
 fetters (of embodiment-view, uncertainty, misapprehension of virtue and
 duty, desire for sensuality, and ill will, and so reached the third stage
 of realization, the path of non-return), still his conceit 'I am,' desire
 (chanda) 'I am,' underlying tendency 'I am,' with respect to the five categorie

On a certain occasion it had been stated by the Buddha how, when a man knows
 and sees the five categories, whatever their mode, thus "this is not mine,
 this is not what I am, this is not by self," there come to be no more underlyin
g tendencies to treat this body with its consciousness, and all external
 signs, in terms of "I" and "Mine" (ahankaara-mamankaara).
 Then in a certain bhikkhu's mind this thought arose "So, it seems, materiality
 is not self, nor are feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness.
 Then what self will the action done by the not-self touch?"' (M.
 109/vol.
 iii, 18-9).
 He was rebuked for ignoring the Buddha's teaching of dependency.
 Again, when the Buddha was asked by the naked ascetic Kassapa whether suffering
 was of one's own making or of another's or both or neither, the Buddha
 replied "Do not put it like that." When asked whether there was no suffering
 or whether the Buddha neither knew nor saw it, the Buddha replied that
 there was, and that he both knew and saw it.
 He then said "Kassapa, if one asserts that 'He who makes (it) feels (it):
 being one existent from the beginning, his suffering is of his own making,'
 then one arrives at eternalism.
 But if one asserts that one makes (it), another feels (it); being one existent
 crushed out by feeling, his suffering is of another's making,' then one
 arrives at annihilationism.
 Instead of resorting to either extreme a Tathaagata teaches the Dhamma
 by the middle way (by dependent origination)" (S.

Now what is called an "acquisition of self" (atta-pa.tilaabha; see end of
 section on Attaa, above) — in other words, the person or individuality
 — may be physical or mental or immaterial according to the plane of being
 (sensual, material, or immaterial) in which rebirth has taken place.
 Also from birth to birth any one kind can succeed and so must exclude any
 other.
 That being so, it cannot be successfully argued that only one of the three
 kinds is true and the others wrong; one can only say that the term for
 each one does not apply to the other two.
 Just as with milk from a cow, curd from milk, butter from curd, ghee from
 butter, and fine-extract of ghee from ghee, the term for each applies only
 to that and not to any of the others (but they are not disconnected).

 and any identification is always wrong: yena yena hi ma~n~nati tato ta"m
 hoti a~n~nathaa (Ud.

 There are three principal types of argument used by the Buddha, with which
 he exposes self-theories by means of the very basis on which they are built.
 These are: (1) "affliction" (or insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery),
 (2) "impermanence" and (3) "non-existence" (of the kind postulated.)

If self is identified with any of the five categories indiscriminately or
 with, say, the eye, then since one cannot have any of these as one wishes
 in this way "Let it be thus, let it be not thus" one suffers affliction
 by it and so cannot claim to have mastery over it; consequently it cannot
 rightly be called "self" (M.
 35).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it is claimed that self is consciousness, then it can be shown that because
 consciousness always arises dependent on impermanent conditions, it too
 is impermanent (M.
 38; 109).
 Again, if self is identified with feeling, it can be asked: With pleasant
 or unpleasant or neutral feeling? Whichever is admitted, then since the
 three kinds of feeling come and go (for when one is present the others
 are absent), self must come and go too.
 Consequently such a self is likewise untenable (D.
 15).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, on the other hand, it is claimed that self is "not feeling and has nothing
 to do with it," then it can be asked whether, where there is no feeling
 at all, one can say "I am," and no affirmative answer can be given (for
 without feeling there would be no experience on which the mirage "I am,"
 depends).
 Again, if it is claimed that self, "while not feeling is not without experience
 of feeling since it feels and is inseparable from the idea of feeling,"
 then it can be asked whether, if feeling altogether ceased, one could say
 "I am this," and no affirmative answer can be given (for without feeling
 there could be no means of identifying what "I am"; (D.
 15).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last argument, among others, precludes predicating attaa of nibbaana,
 which is called "cessation of perception and feeling" (see e.g.
 Iti.
 II, ii, 7).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic of not-self, unlike those of impermanence and suffering,
 does not have its opposite applied to extinction: attaa cannot be, and
 never is, applied to nibbaana.

"I discipline my hearers thus...: 'Bhikkhus, materiality is impermanent, and
 so are feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness; materiality
 is not-self, and so are feeling, perception, formations and consciousness.

\begin_layout Standard
"What is perception of not-self? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or
 to the root of a tree, or to a room that is void, considers thus: "Eye
 is not self, forms are not self, ear...
 sounds...
 nose...
 odors...
 tongue...
 flavours...
 body...

 ideas are not self.
 That is how he abides contemplating not-self in these six in-oneself-and-extern

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever is conditioned should be judged according to its actual nature
 of impermanence and contingency, no matter whether even a pleasant abiding
 (sukha-vihaara) or a quiet abiding (santa-vihaara).
 "Whatever is there to be included as materiality or feeling or perception
 or formations or consciousness, such things (dhammaa) he sees as impermanent,
 as suffering, as ailment, as a cancer, as a dart, as a calamity, as an
 affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self" (M.

 i, 435; A.

 quoted at Vis.
 Ch.

 And again, "Whatever is not yours, abandon it.
 When you have abandoned it, that will be long for your welfare and happiness.
 What is not yours? Materiality is not yours..." (M.
 22/vol.
 i, 140).
 "When a bhikkhu abides much with his mind fortified by perception of not-self
 in suffering, his mind is rid of conceits that treat in terms of 'I' and
 'mine' this body with its consciousness, and all external signs" (A.
 VII, 46/vol.
 iv, 53).
 And "when a bhikkhu sees six rewards it should be enough for him to establish
 perception of not-self unlimitedly in all formations.
 What six? 'I shall be aloof (atammaya) from the world of all (from all
 the world); I shall be no more impeded by treating in terms of "I" and
 likewise of "mine"; I shall come to possess knowledge not shared (by all);
 and I shall see clearly causation, and also causally arisen things'" (A.
 VI, 104/vol.
 iii, 444).
 "When a man knows and sees the eye (etc.) as not self, his fetters come
 to be abolished" (S.
 XXXV, 55/vol.
 iv, 31-2) and "Perception of not-self reaches the abolition of the conceit
 'I am,' which is extinction (nibbaana) here and now" (Ud.
 IV, i).
 Lastly, "It is impossible that anyone with right view should see any thing
 as self" (M.

 iii, 64).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The perception of not-self is the third of the "Eighteen Principal Insights"
 (mahaa-vipassanaa; see article Anicca), of which the Visuddhi magga says
 "One who maintains in being the contemplation of not-self abandons perception
 of self" and "contemplation of not-self and contemplation of voidness are
 one in meaning and only the letter is different" (Vis.
 Ch.
 XX/p.
 628) since "one who maintains in being the contemplation of not-self abandons
 misinterpreting (abhinivesa)." On the development of the contemplation of
 not-self based on rise and fall given in the Visuddhimagga (Ch.
 XXI) see article Anicca.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pa.tisambhidaamagga connects this contemplation specially with the faculty
 of understanding (pa~n~naa), and it is there called the third "Gateway
 to Liberation." "When one gives attention to not-self, the understanding
 faculty is outstanding" (see article Anicca).

 Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a skilled and versatile teacher with mastery over pedagogic technique,
 the Buddha adopted different styles of presentation to communicate the
 Dhamma to his disciples.
 Often he would explain a teaching in detail (vittharena).
 Having introduced his topic with a short statement, technically called
 the uddesa or synopsis, he would then embark on the detailed exposition,
 the niddesa, also called the analysis, the vibhanga.
 In this stage of the discourse he would break the subject introduced by
 the synopsis down into its component strands, define each strand in turn,
 and draw out its implications, sometimes attaching a simile to illustrate
 the message of the discourse.
 Finally, he would restate the introductory declaration as a conclusion
 (niggamana), now supported by the entire weight of the foregoing analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On other occasions, however, the Buddha would not teach in detail.
 Instead, he would present the Dhamma briefly (sankhittena), offering only
 a short, sometimes even cryptic, statement charged with a profound but
 highly concentrated meaning.
 The Buddha did not teach the Doctrine in this way in order to conceal an
 esoteric message or because he delighted in obscurantism.
 He used this technique because it sometimes proved a more effective means
 of shaking and transforming the minds of his auditors than would have been
 possible by a full elaboration.
 Although direct explanation of the meaning might have transmitted information
 more quickly, such a method might not have produced the lasting and edifying
 effect the Dhamma is intended to instil.
 But by requiring the disciples to reflect upon the meaning and to tease
 it out by sustained inquiry, as well as by mutual discussion, the Buddha
 ensured that when the disciples did come to understand his utterance, its
 message would penetrate deep into the silent recesses of the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While such brief teachings would escape the understanding of the great majority
 of the monks, the mature disciples with sharp faculties of wisdom could
 readily fathom their meaning.
 Under such circumstances the ordinary monks, reluctant to trouble their
 Master with requests for explanation, would turn for clarification to the
 senior disciples whose comprehension of the Dhamma had already been confirmed
 by the Blessed One.
 So important did this function become in the early Buddhist Sangha that
 the Buddha himself established, in the ranks of his most eminent disciples,
 a separate category called "the foremost of those who analyze in detail
 the meaning of what was stated (by me) in brief" (aggam sankhittena bhasitassa
 vittharena attham vibhajantanam).
 The bhikkhu who was assigned to this position by the Master was the Venerable
 Maha Kaccana — Kaccana the Great, so called to distinguish him from others
 who bore the common brahmanical clan name of Kaccayana (shortened to Kaccana).1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After his ordination as a bhikkhu, the Venerable Maha Kaccana usually resided
 in his homeland of Avanti, a remote region to the southwest of the Middle
 Country where the Buddha dwelt, and thus he did not spend as much time
 in the Blessed One's presence as some of the other great disciples did,
 such as Sariputta, Maha Moggallana, and Ananda.
 For this reason we do not find, in the records of the Sutta Pitaka, that
 the Venerable Maha Kaccana figured as prominently in Sangha affairs and
 in the Buddha's ministry as the aforementioned elders.
 Nevertheless, on account of the astuteness of his intellect, the profundity
 of his insight into the Dhamma, and his skill as a speaker, whenever Maha
 Kaccana did join the Buddha for extended periods, the other monks frequently
 turned to him for help in illuminating the meaning of brief statements
 of the Buddha that had been causing them bafflement.
 As a result, we find in the Pali canon a sheaf of discourses spoken by
 the Venerable Maha Kaccana that occupy a place of primary importance.
 These texts, always methodically refined and analytically precise, demonstrate
 with astounding lucidity the far-ranging implications and practical bearings
 of several brief statements of the Buddha that would otherwise, without
 his explication of them, escape our understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The Samsaric Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the case of all the Buddha's chief disciples, the Venerable Maha Kaccana's
 elevation to a position of pre-eminence in the Sangha was the flowering
 of a seed that had been planted long ago in the rolling cycles of samsara,
 the round of rebirths, and had been brought to gradual maturity over countless
 lives.
 The biographical sketch of Maha Kaccana2 relates the story of the future
 disciple's original aspiration to a leading role in the Sangha.
 According to this account, the aspiration was formed 100,000 aeons in the
 past, during the Dispensation of the Buddha Padumuttara.
 At that time Kaccana had been reborn into a wealthy householder family.
 One day he went to hear the Buddha preach, and on that occasion, during
 his sermon, the Buddha appointed a certain bhikkhu as the foremost of those
 who can analyze in detail what had been stated by him in brief.
 The young householder was deeply impressed by the monk on whom this honor
 was bestowed, and the thought occurred to him: "Great indeed is that bhikkhu,
 in that the Teacher praises him so.
 I ought to attain such a position in the Dispensation of some future Buddha."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But to attain such a lofty status in the Dispensation, the generation of
 a wish is by no means sufficient.
 The aspiration must be supported by a base of meritorious deeds.
 Thus the young householder invited the Teacher to receive alms at his home,
 and for a full week he bestowed lavish offerings on the Buddha and his
 company of monks.
 At the week's end he prostrated himself at the Blessed One's feet and voiced
 his heart's desire: "Venerable sir, as the fruit of this offering I do
 not wish for any other achievement but this: that in the future, in the
 Dispensation of a Buddha, I might obtain the same position as the bhikkhu
 you appointed to that position last week."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Lord Padumuttara, looking into the future with his unimpeded knowledge
 of a Fully Enlightened One, saw that the youth's aspiration would be fulfilled.
 He told him: "Young man, in the future, after 100,000 aeons have elapsed,
 a Buddha named Gotama will arise.
 In his Dispensation you will be the foremost of those who can analyze in
 detail the meaning of what the Buddha has stated in brief."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Apadana relates that in this same past life, Kaccana had built for the
 Buddha Padumuttara a stupa with a stone seat, which he had covered with
 gold; he had the stupa embellished with a jewelled parasol and an ornamental
 fan.3 According to the above text, it was after he made this offering that
 the Lord Padumuttara predicted his future attainment to the position of
 a great disciple in the Dispensation of the Buddha Gotama.
 In this prediction the Blessed One also makes other prophecies concerning
 Kaccana's future sojourn in samsara, which from our temporal perspective
 would now constitute his past history.
 The Buddha foretold that as the fruit of his meritorious gifts, the householder
 would become a lord of the gods (devinda) for thirty aeons, exercising
 rulership over the gods.
 Having returned to the human world, he would become a world monarch (cakkavatti
-raja) named Pabhassara, whose body would emit rays of light all around.
 He would spend his next to last existence in the Tusita heaven, and passing
 away from there, he would be reborn in a brahman family with the clan name
 Kaccana.
 In that life he would attain arahantship and be appointed a great disciple
 by the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A later section of the Apadana gives a somewhat different account of Maha
 Kaccana's original aspiration to great discipleship.4 In this version, at
 the time of the Buddha Padumuttara, the future disciple was an ascetic
 living in seclusion in the Himalayas.
 One day, while traveling through the sky by supernormal power, he passed
 over a populated area and saw the Victorious One down below.
 He descended, approached the Master to listen to the Dhamma, and heard
 him praise a certain bhikkhu (whose name was also Kaccana) as the chief
 among those who can elaborate on brief statements.
 Thereupon the ascetic, amazed by this unexpected encounter, went to the
 Himalayas, collected a bouquet of flowers, and, quickly returning to the
 assembly, presented them to the Buddha.
 At that point he formed the aspiration to become the chief expositor of
 the Dhamma in the Dispensation of some future Buddha.
 The Lord Padumuttara then prophesied that his aspiration would be fulfilled
 100,000 aeons later when the Buddha Gotama arises in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this same series of verses Maha Kaccana states that as a result of his
 offering to the Buddha he never took rebirth thereafter in the nether world
 — in the hells, the animal realm, or the sphere of ghosts — but was always
 reborn either in the world of gods or in the human realm.
 Also, when he took rebirth as a human being, he was always reborn into
 the upper two social classes — among nobles or brahmans — and never into
 low-class families.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important incident, which determined a particular feature of the great
 disciple's physical appearance during his final existence, took place during
 the Dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa, the immediate predecessor of Gotama
 in the lineage of Enlightened Ones.
 At the time of the Buddha Kassapa, Kaccana had taken rebirth in a family
 of Benares.
 After the Lord Kassapa's Parinibbana he offered a precious golden brick
 for the construction of a golden stupa for the Buddha.
 On presenting it he made the wish: "Whenever I am reborn, may my body always
 have a golden hue." As a result of this, when he was reborn during the time
 of our Buddha, his body was endowed with a beautiful golden hue, which
 deeply impressed those who beheld it.5 In one case, which we will discuss
 below (see pp.13-15), this physical attribute of the elder led to a bizarre
 series of events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Kaccana's Conversion to the Dhamma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his last existence, when the Buddha Gotama appeared in the world, Kaccana
 was born as the son of the chaplain (purohita) in the city of Ujjeni, the
 capital of Avanti, to the southwest of the Middle Country.6 His father's
 personal name was Tiritivaccha, his mother's Candima,7 and they were of
 the Kaccayana clan, one of the oldest and most highly respected lines of
 brahmans.
 Since he was born with a golden colored body, his parents exclaimed that
 he had brought his name along with him at birth, and they named him "Kañcana,"
 which means "golden." As a brahman and the son of the court chaplain, when
 Kañcana grew up he studied the Three Vedas, the traditional sacred scriptures
 of the brahmans, and after his father's death he succeeded him in the position
 of court chaplain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The king of Avanti at the time that Kaccana became chaplain was Candappajjota,
 Pajjota the Violent.
 He was known by this epithet because of his explosive and unpredictable
 temper.
 When King Candappajjota heard that the Buddha had arisen in the world,
 he assembled his ministers and asked those who were so capable to go and
 invite the Blessed One to visit Ujjeni.
 The ministers all agreed that the only one who was truly capable of bringing
 the Buddha to Avanti was the chaplain Kaccana.
 The king therefore assigned him to go on this mission, but Kaccana laid
 down a condition before he would accede to the king's request: he would
 go only if he would be permitted to become a monk after meeting the Enlightened
 One.
 The king, ready to accept any condition in exchange for a meeting with
 the Tathagata, gave his consent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kaccana set out accompanied by seven other courtiers.
 When they met the Master, he taught them the Dhamma, and at the end of
 the discourse Kaccana and his seven companions all attained arahantship
 together with the four analytical knowledges (patisambhida-ñana).
 The Buddha granted them ordination simply by welcoming them into the Sangha
 with the words, "Come, bhikkhus."8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new bhikkhu, now the Venerable Maha Kaccana, then began to praise the
 splendors of Ujjeni to the Buddha.
 The Master realized that his new disciple wanted him to travel to his native
 land, but he replied that it would be sufficient for Kaccana to go himself,
 as he was already capable of teaching the Dhamma and of inspiring confidence
 in King Candappajjota.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the course of their return journey the party of monks arrived at a town
 named Telapanali, where they stopped to gather alms.
 In that town lived two maidens, merchants' daughters of different families.
 One girl was beautiful, with lovely long hair, but both her parents had
 expired and she lived in poverty, looked after by her governess.
 The other girl was wealthy, but was afflicted with an illness that had
 caused her to lose her hair.
 Repeatedly she had tried to persuade the poor girl to sell her hair so
 she could make a wig but the poor girl had consistently refused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, when the poor girl saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana and his fellow monks
 walking for alms, their bowls as empty as if they had just been washed,
 she felt a sudden surge of faith and devotion arise in her towards the
 elder, and she decided to offer alms to the party of bhikkhus.
 However, as she had no wealth, the only way she could obtain money to buy
 provisions was to sell her hair to the rich girl.
 This time, as the hair came to the rich girl already cut, she paid only
 eight coins for it.
 With these eight coins the poor girl had almsfood prepared for the eight
 bhikkhus, using one coin for each portion.
 After she had presented the alms, as an immediate fruit of the meritorious
 deed, her full head of hair instantly grew back to its original length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Venerable Maha Kaccana arrived back in Ujjeni, he reported this
 incident to King Candappajjota.
 The king had the girl conveyed to his palace and at once appointed her
 his chief queen.
 From that time onwards the king greatly honored Maha Kaccana.
 Many people of Ujjeni who heard the elder preach gained faith in the Dhamma
 and went forth under him as monks.
 Thus the entire city became (in the words of the commentary) "a single
 blaze of saffron robes, a blowing back and forth of the banner of sages."
 The queen, who was exceedingly devoted to the elder, built for him a dwelling
 in the Golden Grove Park.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So says the Anguttara Commentary, but the Pali canon itself suggests that
 the Sangha was not as well established in Avanti as the commentator would
 lead us to believe.
 This fact can be discerned from a story involving the Venerable Maha Kaccana
 that is reported in the Mahavagga of the Vinaya Pitaka.9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this story unfolds, the elder was dwelling in Avanti at his favorite
 residence, the Osprey's Haunt on Precipice Mountain.
 A lay disciple of his named Sona Kutikanna came to him and expressed the
 wish to go forth under him as a monk.
 But Kaccana, seeing perhaps that the householder was not yet ready to take
 such a big step, discouraged him with the words: "Difficult, Sona, is it
 to sleep alone, to eat one meal a day, and to observe celibacy for as long
 as life lasts.
 While remaining a householder, you should apply yourself to the Buddha's
 teaching, and at the proper times you may sleep alone, eat one meal a day,
 and observe celibacy."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these words Sona's enthusiasm for ordination subsided.
 Some time later, however, the urge was rekindled, and he approached the
 Venerable Maha Kaccana with the same request.
 A second time the elder discouraged him, and a second time Sona's desire
 for ordination abated.
 When Sona approached him for the third time and asked for ordination, Maha
 Kaccana gave him the "going forth" (pabbajja), that is, the initial ordination
 as a novice (samanera).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the Buddha's time it seems to have been customary to grant mature
 men, already endowed with faith in the Dhamma and well acquainted with
 its tenets, both ordinations in immediate succession.
 The novice ordination would be given first, and then right afterwards the
 ceremony of higher ordination (upasampada) would be performed, making the
 postulant a bhikkhu, a full member of the Sangha.
 But at the time that the above incident took place Avanti was short of
 monks, being a region quite far from the Buddha's own missionary rounds
 and from the other centers of Buddhist activity.
 According to the disciplinary regulations that were still in effect, the
 higher ordination had to be performed by a chapter of at least ten bhikkhus
 (dasavagga-bhikkhusangha).
 But such was the situation in Avanti that the Venerable Maha Kaccana could
 not easily find even nine other bhikkhus to confer the higher ordination
 on Sona.
 It was only three years later that the elder could, with trouble and difficulty
, convene an assembly of ten bhikkhus from different places in the region
 to give Sona the higher ordination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Venerable Sona had completed his first rains retreat as a bhikkhu,
 the wish arose in him to pay a visit to the Buddha.
 He had heard many times the highest praise of the Blessed One, his lord
 and refuge, yet he had never seen the Master face to face, and now the
 desire to do so had become irresistible.
 He went to his preceptor to ask for his permission to make the long journey
 to Savatthi, where the Buddha was residing.
 Not only did the Venerable Maha Kaccana applaud his disciple's desire to
 see the Buddha, but he asked Sona to convey to the Lord an appeal that
 certain monastic regulations be relaxed to suit the different social and
 geographical conditions that prevailed in Avanti and in other border regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Venerable Sona came to the Buddha and explained his preceptor's
 request, the Master readily agreed.
 First, to determine what districts should count as border regions, the
 Buddha defined the boundaries of the Middle Country, wherein the original
 regulations were to remain binding.
 Then he announced the revised versions of the rules that would apply in
 the border regions, though not in the Middle Country.
 These revised rules are the following: (1) The higher ordination would
 not require ten bhikkhus but could now be given by a chapter of five, one
 of whom must be a master of the Vinaya, the monastic discipline.
 (2) Monks are allowed to use sandals with thick linings, as the ground
 in those regions is rough and hard on the feet.
 (3) Monks are permitted to bathe frequently, as the people of Avanti attach
 great importance to bathing.
 (4) Sheepskins and goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets.
 (5) Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district,
 and the ten days' period during which (under the rule) an extra robe could
 be kept would begin only when the robe actually reaches his hands.
\end_layout

 Various Incidents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither the suttas nor the commentaries offer us abundant biographical informati
on about the Venerable Maha Kaccana's life in the Sangha.
 They focus, rather, on his role as teacher, especially on his detailed
 expositions of the Buddha's brief statements.
 From the settings (nidana) to the suttas in which Maha Kaccana appears,
 we can infer that after his ordination he spent most of his time in Avanti.
 Usually, it seems, he dwelt quietly in seclusion, though when occasion
 arose he gave instruction to others.
 Periodically he would go to visit the Buddha at his main places of residence,
 and it seems likely that he also sometimes accompanied him on his preaching
 tours.
 The three suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya in which Maha Kaccana appears in
 the role of expositor open at three different locales — in Kapilavatthu,
 Rajagaha, and Savatthi.
 As these cities were, relative to the geographical extent of the Ganges
 Valley, widely separated from each other, and as all were far from Avanti,
 this suggests either that the Venerable Maha Kaccana spent long periods
 accompanying the Buddha on his journeys or that he would travel to the
 different monastic centers where the Buddha resided when he heard that
 the Master intended to stay there for some time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not find in the texts indications that Maha Kaccana entered into close
 friendships with the other leading monks, as for instance Sariputta, Maha
 Moggallana, and Ananda did with one another.
 He seems to be one who generally lived aloof, though he did not place a
 strict emphasis on seclusion in the manner of one like the Venerable Maha
 Kassapa, nor did he seem especially stern in his asceticism.10 He was ready
 to assume teaching duties on request, as we shall see, but we find that
 he always appears in the suttas in the role of expositor and elucidator
 of the Dhamma to others.
 We do not see the Venerable Maha Kaccana engage in person-to-person dialogues
 with other monks, as we see in the case of all the above-mentioned elders;
 neither do we see him address inquiries to the Buddha, as even the wisest
 of the bhikkhus, the Venerable Sariputta, often did.
 His absence is conspicuous in the Mahagosinga Sutta (MN 32), wherein the
 other outstanding disciples gather on a full-moon night to discuss the
 ideal bhikkhu who could illuminate the forest.
 On that occasion six great elders — Sariputta, Moggallana, Ananda, Maha
 Kassapa, Anuruddha, and Revata — each describe the ideal bhikkhu according
 to their particular dispositions, and at the end the Buddha offers his
 own picture of the most worthy monk.
 Surely if Maha Kaccana was present on that occasion he would have described
 such a monk as one skilled in the detailed exposition of brief sayings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maha Kaccana did grant ordination, as we saw above in the case of Sona,
 though his pupils were probably not very numerous, despite the words of
 the Anguttara Commentary.
 One of his pupils was the bhikkhu Isidatta, who even while very young had
 impressed many of the older monks with his incisive replies to difficult
 questions on the Dhamma.11 There can be little doubt that Isidatta's adroitness
 in tackling subtle points of doctrine reflects the rigorous training he
 must have received from the Venerable Maha Kaccana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On one occasion when the Venerable Maha Kaccana visited the Buddha he received
 special homage from Sakka, the king of the gods.12 This occurred when the
 Buddha was dwelling at the Eastern Park at Savatthi, in the Mansion of
 Migara's Mother.
 The Lord was sitting surrounded by a company of great disciples on the
 occasion of the pavarana, the ceremony of mutual criticism among the monks
 which ends the annual rains retreat.
 Because Maha Kaccana regularly used to visit the Buddha in order to hear
 the Dhamma, coming even from a long distance, the other chief elders would
 always reserve a seat for him in case he should unexpectedly turn up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On this occasion Sakka, along with his celestial retinue, drew near to the
 holy assembly and prostrated himself before the Blessed One.
 Since he did not see the Venerable Maha Kaccana, he thought to himself:
 "It would be good indeed if the noble elder would arrive." Just at that
 moment Maha Kaccana approached and took his seat.
 When Sakka beheld him, he grasped him firmly by the ankles, expressed his
 joy over the elder's arrival, and honored him with gifts of scents and
 flowers.
 Some of the younger monks were upset and complained that Sakka was being
 partial in his display of reverence, but the Buddha reproved them with
 the words: "Monks, those monks who, like my son Maha Kaccana, guard the
 doors of the senses, are beloved both among gods and humans." He then pronounced
 the following stanza of the Dhammapada (v.94):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Even the gods hold him dear, Whose senses are subdued Like horses trained
 well by a charioteer, Whose pride is destroyed, And who is free from corruption
s."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the Venerable Maha Kaccana was actually one who devoted much attention
 to the mastery of the sense faculties is borne out by his discourses, which
 (as we shall see below) often emphasize the need for guarding "the doors
 of the senses."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commentaries record two curious series of events, both of which stemmed
 from the impression that the elder's physical form made on the minds of
 others.
 One of these, reported in the Dhammapada Commentary,13 involved a young
 man named Soreyya, who was the son of the treasurer in the city of the
 same name.
 One day the youth Soreyya was driving out of the city in a carriage, en
 route to a bathing spot together with an intimate friend and a merry band
 of companions.
 Just as they were leaving the city the Venerable Maha Kaccana was standing
 at the city gate, putting on his outer robe before entering to walk on
 alms round.
 When the youth Soreyya beheld the golden-hued body of the elder, he thought
 to himself: "Oh, that this elder might become my wife! Or may the hue of
 my wife's body become like the hue of his body!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the very moment this thought passed through his mind, Soreyya was instantly
 transformed from a man into a woman.
 Startled by this inexplicable change of sex, he jumped out of the carriage
 and fled before the others could notice what had occurred.
 Gradually he made his way to the city of Takkasila.
 His companions searched for him in vain and reported his strange disappearance
 to his parents.
 When all attempts to trace him proved futile, his parents concluded that
 he had died and they had the funeral rites performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meanwhile the woman Soreyya, on reaching Takkasila, met the son of the city's
 treasurer, who fell in love with her and took her as his wife.
 In the first years of their marriage she gave birth to two sons.
 Previously, while a man, Soreyya had fathered two sons through his wife
 in his native city.
 Thus he was the parent of four children, two as a father and two as a mother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day the former intimate friend of Soreyya came to Takkasila on some
 personal business.
 Lady Soreyya saw him in the street and recognized him.
 She called him into her house and revealed to him the secret of her mysterious
 metamorphosis from a man into a woman.
 The friend proposed that Soreyya should offer alms to the Venerable Maha
 Kaccana, who was living close by, and then beg pardon from him for having
 given rise to such a lewd thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The friend then went to the elder and invited him to come to the lady's
 house for alms on the following day.
 When the Venerable Maha Kaccana arrived, the friend brought Lady Soreyya
 into his presence, informed him of what had happened long ago, and asked
 him to pardon her for that transgression.
 As soon as the elder uttered the words "I pardon you," Lady Soreyya was
 transformed back into a man.
 Shaken out of all worldly complacency by this double metamorphosis, Soreyya
 determined that he could never again lead the household life.
 He took ordination as a bhikkhu under Maha Kaccana, and after a short time
 attained arahantship together with the supernormal powers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vassakara, the chief minister of Magadha under the parricide King Ajatasattu,
 was less fortunate, though his misfortune sprang entirely from his own
 pride and obstinacy and not from some force outside his control.
 The commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya reports that one day, when Vassakara
 saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana coming down from the mountain Vulture Peak,
 he exclaimed: "He looks just like a monkey!"14 Such an exclamation seems
 strange, particularly as Maha Kaccana is described in the texts as being
 especially handsome and graceful in his physical presence.
 Whatever the reason for the remark, news of the incident spread and eventually
 reached the Buddha.
 The Blessed One said that if Vassakara should go to the elder and beg his
 pardon, all would be well; but if he does not ask pardon he would be reborn
 as a monkey in the Bamboo Grove in Rajagaha.
 This was reported back to Vassakara.
 As the chief minister of the kingdom, he must have been too proud to beg
 forgiveness from a mendicant monk.
 Thus, reflecting that whatever the Buddha says must turn out to be true,
 he resigned himself to his future fate and made preparations for his next
 existence by planting trees in the Bamboo Grove and setting up a guard
 to protect the wild life there.
 It is said that some time after his death a monkey was born in the Bamboo
 Grove who would draw near when one called out "Vassakara."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circumstances of the Venerable Maha Kaccana's death are not recorded
 in the texts, but at the end of the Madhura Sutta (discussed below) Maha
 Kaccana declares that the Buddha has attained Parinibbana, so it is evident
 from this that he himself outlived his Master.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 The Elaborator of Brief Statements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha honored the Venerable Maha Kaccana by naming him his foremost
 disciple in the ability to provide detailed expositions of his own brief
 statements.
 Maha Kaccana earned this distinguished title principally because of eight
 suttas found in the Nikayas: three in the Majjhima, three in the Samyutta,
 and two in the Anguttara.
 Besides these, we find in the Nikayas several other discourses that the
 Venerable Maha Kaccana spoke without basing himself upon a brief utterance
 of the Buddha as his text.
 All these discourses, taken together, have a uniform and distinctive flavor,
 revealing the qualities of the mind from which they sprang.
 They are thorough, balanced, careful and cautious, substantial in content,
 meticulous in expression, incisive, well conceived, and well rounded.
 They are also, admittedly, a little dry — unemotional and unsentimental
 — but with no wastage of words they never fail to lead us straight to the
 heart of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discourses of Maha Kaccana are bare of the rhetorical devices utilized
 by other renowned exponents of the Dhamma: we find in them no similes,
 parables, or stories; their language is plain but impeccably precise.
 In this respect his sermons contrast with those of the Buddha, the Venerable
 Sariputta, and the Venerable Ananda, all of whom were skilled in devising
 striking similes that impress the formal message of the discourse indelibly
 on the auditor's mind.
 The Venerable Maha Kaccana's discourses, it seems, owe their effectiveness
 entirely to their content and analytical exactitude rather than to literary
 embellishment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an analyst of the Dhamma, the Venerable Maha Kaccana most closely approximate
s to the Venerable Sariputta, and indeed the discourses of both exhibit
 similar traits.
 The difference between them is principally a matter of emphasis rather
 than of substance.
 Sariputta's analytic disquisitions, as seen for example in the Sammaditthi
 Sutta and the Mahahatthipadopama Sutta,15 begin with a specified topic
 and then develop by dissecting that topic into its component strands and
 exploring each component in turn (often with still finer subdivisions).
 Within his own specialized sphere Maha Kaccana starts, not with a general
 topic, but with a short utterance of the Buddha, often one that is intuitive,
 poetic, or exhortatory in character.
 His exposition then unfolds by reformulating the gnomic or inspirational
 phrasing of the Buddha's statement in ways that link it up with established,
 more familiar frameworks of doctrine, usually with the six spheres of sense
 and the practice of sense restraint.
 Yet, despite their differences in emphasis, both these great disciples
 share a predilection for systematic analysis and both display the same
 concern for razor-sharp precision in their thinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, no doubt, within the Theravada tradition each has come
 to be regarded as the father of a particular methodology for interpreting
 the Dhamma, exegetical systems that rose to prominence in the early centuries
 of Buddhist intellectual history.
 Sariputta is, of course, viewed as the original systematizer of the Abhidhamma,
 which (according to tradition) he elaborated in detail based on the outlines
 that the Buddha taught him during his periodic visits to the human realm
 while expounding the Abhidhamma to the devas in the Tavatimsa heaven.16
 Maha Kaccana is regarded as the author of a method of exposition embedded
 in two post-canonical works that exerted an important influence on the
 early Buddhist commentators.
 About these two works — the Petakopadesa and the Nettippakarana — we shall
 have more to say below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) The Majjhima Nikaya
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya in which the Venerable Maha Kaccana
 plays a prominent role is the Madhupindika Sutta (MN 18), the Honeyball
 Discourse, a title assigned to it by the Buddha himself — perhaps a unique
 instance of the Buddha's conferring a title upon a sutta spoken by a disciple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sutta opens on an occasion when the Buddha is dwelling at the city of
 Kapilavatthu in his native land, the Sakyan republic.
 One day, while the Buddha is sitting in meditation in Nigrodha's Park,
 an arrogant Sakyan named Dandapani approaches him and asks him, in a deliberate
ly discourteous tone: "What does the recluse assert, what does he proclaim?"
 The Buddha replies with an answer intended to underscore his own refusal
 to be dragged into the type of contention that his questioner wants to
 provoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Friend, I assert and proclaim such (a teaching) that one does not quarrel
 with anyone in the world with its gods, its Maras and its Brahmas, in this
 generation with its recluses and brahmans, its princes and its people;
 such (a teaching) that perceptions no more underlie that brahman who abides
 detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of worry, free
 from craving for any kind of being."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reply is utterly incomprehensible to Dandapani, who raises his eyebrows
 in bewilderment and departs.
 Later, in the evening, the Buddha informs the bhikkhus what had transpired.
 One monk inquires: "What exactly is the teaching that the Blessed One proclaims
 whereby one can avoid all quarrels and, at the same time, be free from
 the pernicious influence of craving?" The Buddha answers with the following
 pithy statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Bhikkhus, as to the source through which perceptions and notions tinged
 by mental proliferation beset a person: if nothing is found there to delight
 in, welcome, and hold to, this is the end of the underlying tendencies
 to lust, aversion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire for being, and ignorance;
 this is the end of reliance on rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes,
 recrimination, malice, and false speech; here these evil unwholesome states
 cease without remainder."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having said this, before the monks even have time to ask for an explanation,
 the Lord rises from his seat and enters his dwelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the Buddha has retired, the bhikkhus ponder his statement, and realizing
 that they cannot understand it on their own, they consider: "The Venerable
 Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions
 in the holy life.
 He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning.
 Suppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of this."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they approach Maha Kaccana and make their request, he first chides
 them for coming to him rather than asking the Buddha to clarify it.
 To come to him when the Blessed One is present, he says, is like seeking
 heartwood among the branches and leaves of a great tree after passing over
 the trunk.
 The Blessed One is the one who knows and sees; he is vision, he is knowledge,
 he has become the Dhamma, become the holy one; he is the sayer, the proclaimer,
 the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the Lord of the
 Dhamma, the Tathagata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bhikkhus, however, while admitting that the elder's reproach is warranted,
 still insist that he himself is able to explain the meaning.
 Finally the elder consents and then gives the following explanation of
 the Buddha's brief statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises.
 The meeting of the three is contact.
 With contact as condition there is feeling.
 What one feels, that one perceives.
 What one perceives, that one thinks about.
 What one thinks about, that one mentally proliferates.
 With what one has mentally proliferated as the source, perceptions and
 notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a person with respect to past,
 future, and present forms cognizable through the eye."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same pattern is repeated for each of the other sense bases.
 The elder then connects the entire exposition with the principle of conditional
ity, showing how each term in the series arises in dependence on the preceding
 term and ceases with the cessation of its predecessor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This passage, rich in implications, offers a penetrative account of the
 process by which the deluded mind becomes overwhelmed by its own imaginary
 creations — its distorted perceptions and mental constructs.
 The sequence begins as a straightforward description of the conditioned
 genesis of cognition: each type of consciousness arises in dependence on
 its respective sense faculty and object.
 The process unfolds in the natural order through contact, feeling, and
 perception as far as the stage of thinking.
 But in the unenlightened worldling, who lacks correct insight into the
 true nature of things, at the stage of thought cognition is vitiated by
 the influence of papañca, a difficult Pali word best rendered as "conceptual
 proliferation."17 Instead of correctly comprehending the objects of perception,
 the deluded mind, infiltrated by papañca, spins out a complex mental commentary
 which embellishes things with the erroneous notions of "mine," "I," and
 "my self." Thereby the person is overrun by "perceptions and notions tinged
 by mental proliferation" (papañcasaññasankha).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The underlying springs of this conceptual proliferation are three defilements:
 craving (tanha), conceit (mana), and wrong view (ditthi).
 When these three gain control of the thought process, cognition runs wild,
 churning up a host of delusive ideas, obsessions, and passions which overpower
 the subject and reduce him to their hapless victim.
 This process of sense perception, as Maha Kaccana shows, is "the source
 through which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset
 a person," referred to by the Buddha in his brief statement.
 When there is no delighting in the process of perception by way of craving,
 which elaborates upon experience in terms of the notion "mine"; when there
 is no welcoming it by way of conceit, which introduces the notion "I am";
 when there is no holding to it by way of wrong view, which proliferates
 in notions of a self, then all the underlying tendencies to the defilements
 will be uprooted, and one can dwell in the world as a liberated sage, holy
 and wise, without quarrels, conflicts, and disputes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such was the explanation of the Buddha's words that the Venerable Maha Kaccana
 offered to the monks.
 Afterwards the monks approached the Blessed One and told him what Maha
 Kaccana had said.
 The Buddha replied with words of the highest praise for his disciple: "Maha
 Kaccana is wise, bhikkhus, Maha Kaccana has great wisdom.
 If you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you
 in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it.
 Such is the meaning of this, and so you should remember it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just then the Venerable Ananda, standing nearby, added a memorable simile
 to highlight the beauty of Maha Kaccana's exposition: "Just as if a man
 exhausted by hunger and weakness came upon a honeyball, in the course of
 eating it he would find a sweet delectable flavor; so too, venerable sir,
 any able bhikkhu, in the course of scrutinizing with wisdom the meaning
 of this discourse on the Dhamma, would find satisfaction and confidence
 of mind." On the basis of this simile the Buddha named the discourse the
 Madhupindika Sutta, "The Honeyball Discourse."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other two Majjhima Nikaya suttas featuring Maha Kaccana, and one in
 the Anguttara Nikaya, conform to this same stereotyped pattern: the Buddha
 makes a brief statement, gets up, and enters his dwelling; the monks approach
 the Venerable Maha Kaccana to ask for an explanation of the meaning; he
 reprimands them for coming to him rather than asking the Lord himself,
 but finally he complies with their request and elucidates the Buddha's
 utterance; the monks return to the Buddha and repeat his analysis, which
 the Master applauds with words of praise for the elder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Maha Kaccana Bhaddekaratta Sutta (MN 133) centers around the famous
 Bhaddekaratta poem, a set of verses spoken by the Buddha that had been
 circulating within the Sangha.
 The poem stresses the need to abandon longing for the past and anticipation
 of the future; it calls instead for urgent effort to marshal one's energies
 for penetrating with insight the present reality itself.
 Many of the monks had learned the poem by heart, along with the Buddha's
 own exegesis of it, and had been using it as an inspiration for their meditatio
n practice and as a theme for sermons.18
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One bhikkhu named Samiddhi, however, did not know even the poem, let alone
 its exegesis.
 One day a benevolent deity, taking compassion on him, came to him in the
 early morning and urged him to learn the Bhaddekaratta poem and exposition.
 The Venerable Samiddhi went to the Buddha and asked him to teach him the
 Bhaddekaratta summary and its analysis.
 The Buddha recited the poem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Let not a person revive the past Or on the future build his hopes, For
 the past has been left behind And the future has not been reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead with insight let him see Each presently arisen state; Let him know
 that and be sure of it, Invincibly, unshakeably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today the effort must be made; Tomorrow Death may come, who knows? No bargain
 with Mortality Can keep him and his hoards away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But one who dwells thus ardently, Relentlessly, by day, by night — It is
 he, the Peaceful Sage has said, Who has one fortunate attachment."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Samiddhi, and the other monks present at the time, went to the Venerable
 Maha Kaccana in search of an explanation.
 As in the prelude to the Madhupindika Sutta, Maha Kaccana at first remonstrates
 with them, but then agrees to share his understanding of the poem.
 Taking up the first two lines as the theme of his exposition, he explicates
 each by way of the six sense bases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One "revives the past" when one recollects the eye and forms seen in the
 past, dwelling upon them with desire and lust; so too with the other five
 sense faculties and their objects.
 One "builds up hope upon the future" when one sets one's heart on experiencing
 in the future sense objects one has not yet encountered.
 One who does not bind himself by desire and lust to memories of past sensory
 experience and yearnings for future sensory experience is one who "does
 not revive the past or build up hope upon the future." Similarly, one whose
 mind is shackled by lust to the present sense faculties and their objects
 is called "one vanquished in regard to presently arisen states," while
 one whose mind is not bound to them by lust is called "one invincible in
 regard to presently arisen states."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, the monks return to the Buddha, who says "if you had asked me the
 meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way that
 Maha Kaccana has explained it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third Majjhima sutta, the Uddesavibhanga Sutta (MN 138), opens with
 the Buddha announcing to the monks that he will teach them a summary (uddesa)
 and an exposition (vibhanga).
 He recites the summary thus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should examine things in such a way that while he is
 examining them, his consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally
 nor stuck internally, and by not clinging he does not become agitated.
 If his consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck
 internally, and if by not clinging he does not become agitated, then for
 him there is no origination of suffering — of birth, aging, and death in
 the future."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, as on prior occasions, he rises from his seat and retires, without
 giving the exposition — a strange omission, as he had announced that he
 would teach the exposition! But the monks do not feel lost, for the Venerable
 Maha Kaccana is in their midst, and after his usual protest, he begins
 his analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He proceeds by taking up each phrase in the Buddha's summary and dissecting
 it in minute detail.
 How is consciousness "distracted and scattered externally"? When a monk
 has seen a form with the eye (or has experienced some other sense object
 with its corresponding faculty), "if his consciousness follows after the
 sign of form, is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form,
 is fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of form, then his
 consciousness is called 'distracted and scattered externally.' " But if,
 on seeing a form with the eye, etc., the monk does not follow after the
 sign of form, does not become tied and shackled to the sign of form, then
 his consciousness is called 'not distracted and scattered externally.' "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mind is "stuck internally" if he attains any of the four jhanas, the
 meditative absorptions, and his mind becomes "tied and shackled" by gratificati
on in the superior rapture, bliss, peace, and equanimity of the jhana.
 If he can attain the jhanas without becoming attached to them, his mind
 is "not stuck internally."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is "agitation due to clinging" (upadaya paritassana) in the "uninstructed
 worldling" (assutava puthujjana), who regards his five aggregates as self.
 When his form, or feeling, or perception, or volitional formations, or
 consciousness undergoes change and deterioration, his mind becomes preoccupied
 with the change, and he becomes anxious, distressed, and concerned.
 Thus there is agitation due to clinging.
 But the instructed noble disciple does not regard the five aggregates as
 his self.
 Therefore, when the aggregates undergo change and transformation, his mind
 is not preoccupied with the change and he dwells free from anxiety, agitation,
 and concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, the elder states, is how he understands in detail the summary stated
 in brief by the Blessed One, and when the monks report to the Master, he
 endorses his disciple's explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The Samyutta Nikaya
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Samyutta Nikaya contains three suttas in which the Venerable Maha Kaccana
 displays his ingenuity in elaborating upon brief utterances of the Buddha:
 SN 22:3, SN 22:4, and SN 35:130.
 These suttas are different both in setting and character from the three
 analytical discourses of the Majjhima Nikaya.
 In all three Maha Kaccana is not dwelling in the midst of the Sangha in
 close proximity to the Buddha, but in Avanti, at the Osprey's Haunt on
 Precipice Mountain, presumably a remote place difficult of access.
 Then a lay devotee named Haliddikani, evidently quite learned in the Dhamma,
 comes to him and asks him to explain in detail a short discourse of the
 Buddha.
 Maha Kaccana's reply is addressed to the householder Haliddikani alone,
 not to a group of monks, and there is no subsequent confirmation of his
 exposition by the Buddha at the end of the discourse.
 It seems impossible to determine whether these exchanges took place during
 the Buddha's life or after his demise, but obviously, to have been incorporated
 into the Canon, reports of the discussions must have reached the main centers
 of the Buddhist community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In SN 22:3, Haliddikani asks the elder to explain in detail the meaning
 of a verse from "The Questions of Magandiya," included in the Atthakavagga
 of the Sutta Nipata (v.844):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Having left home to roam without abode, In the village the sage is intimate
 with none; Rid of sensual pleasures, without preference, He would not engage
 people in dispute."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In responding to the lay devotee's request, the Venerable Maha Kaccana introduce
s a methodology that is strikingly different from his approach to interpretation
 in the three suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya.
 Here he does not simply elaborate upon the literal meaning of the Buddha's
 statement, drawing out its philosophical and practical implications as
 he did in those suttas.
 Instead he transposes the key expressions of the verse to a different level
 of discourse, treating these expressions, not merely as obscure terms in
 need of clarification and exemplification, but as metaphors or figures
 of speech that to be properly understood must be redefined in terms of
 their non-figurative meanings.
 He does this, as we shall see just below, by first eliciting from the selected
 figurative terms their implicit literal meanings and then mapping those
 meanings on to other, more systematic frames of doctrine.
 This technique was to become characteristic of the Pali commentaries in
 later centuries, and we might even regard Maha Kaccana's style of exegesis
 here as being, in certain respects at least, the original prototype of
 the commentarial method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking up first the expression "having left home" (okam pahaya), Maha Kaccana
 treats the word "home," not as bearing the literal meaning of a place where
 people live, but as an elliptical reference to the "home of consciousness"
 (viññanassa oko).
 He explains that the "home of consciousness" is the other four aggregates
 — material form, feeling, perception, and volitional formations — which
 are here referred to as elements (dhatu); elsewhere these are described
 as the four "stations of consciousness" (viññana-thiti).19 If consciousness
 is bound by lust to these four elements, one is said to move about in a
 home.
 If one has abandoned all desire, lust, delight, and craving for these four
 homes of consciousness, one is said to "roam about homeless" (anokasari).
 It should be noted that this last term does not itself occur in the verse,
 but Maha Kaccana has introduced it into his exegesis as a description of
 one who has abandoned home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next the elder explicates the phrase "to roam without abode" (aniketasari).
 He first defines the counterpart, "roaming about in an abode" (niketasari),
 which also does not appear in the verse.
 As before, Maha Kaccana treats this expression as a metaphor to be reformulated
 in terms of systematic doctrine.
 In this instance, rather than using the five aggregates as his scaffold,
 he draws in the six external sense bases.
 By being shackled to the sign of forms (sounds, odors, etc.), by moving
 about in the abode of forms, etc., one is called "one who roams about in
 an abode." When one has abandoned all bondage to the sign of forms, etc.,
 cut them off at the root, then one is said to "roam without abode."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remaining sections of the exposition proceed more literally, and simply
 explicate, with straightforward definition, the meaning of the phrases
 used in the verse, always in terms of contrasting pairs.
 One who is "intimate with none in the village" is defined as a bhikkhu
 who keeps aloof from lay people and their worldly concerns.
 One "rid of sensual pleasures" is one devoid of lust and craving for sensual
 pleasures.
 One "without preferences" (apurakkharano) is one who does not yearn for
 the future.
 And one who "would not engage people in dispute" is one who does not become
 embroiled in quarrels and disputes over the interpretation of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next sutta (SN 22:4) Haliddikani asks how one should understand in
 detail the following brief statement of the Buddha, found in "The Questions
 of Sakka":20 "Those recluses and brahmans who are liberated by the full
 destruction of craving are those who have reached the ultimate end, the
 ultimate security from bondage, the ultimate holy life, the ultimate goal,
 and are best among devas and humans." Maha Kaccana explains:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Householder, the desire for the material-form element, (for the feeling
 element, the perception element, the volitional-formations element, the
 consciousness element), the lust, the delight, the craving, the engagement
 and clinging, the mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies
 regarding it: through their destruction, fading away, cessation, giving
 up, and relinquishment, the mind is called well liberated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Thus, householder, it is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated
 in brief by the Blessed One should be understood in detail."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a third sutta (SN 35:130) Haliddikani begins a query with a quotation
 from the Buddha, but this time he does not ask: "how should the meaning
 of this brief statement be understood in detail?" Rather, he simply requests
 the Venerable Maha Kaccana to explain the following excerpt from the Dhatusamyu
tta (SN 14:4): "Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements
 that there arises the diversity of contacts; in dependence on the diversity
 of contacts that there arises the diversity of feelings."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha himself had explained this assertion by showing how the different
 kinds of elements condition their corresponding kinds of contact and feeling:
 "In dependence on the eye element there arises eye-contact; in dependence
 on eye-contact there arises feeling born of eye-contact." And so for the
 other sense faculties.
 The Venerable Maha Kaccana, however, does not merely parrot the Buddha's
 analysis, but carries the divisions down to a finer level:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Here, householder, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu understands
 one that is agreeable thus: 'Such it is.' In dependence on eye-consciousness
 and a contact to be experienced as pleasant, there arises a pleasant feeling.
 Then, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu understands one that is
 disagreeable thus: 'Such it is.' In dependence on eye-consciousness and
 a contact to be experienced as painful, there arises a painful feeling.
 Then, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu understands one that is
 a basis for equanimity thus: 'Such it is.' In dependence on eye-consciousness
 and a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, there
 arises a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same analysis is applied to each of the other sense faculties.
 Thus, while the Buddha merely differentiates the contact and feeling by
 way of the sense faculty, the Venerable Maha Kaccana distinguishes within
 each sense sphere three qualities of the object — agreeable, disagreeable,
 and indifferent; three qualities of the contact — to be felt as pleasant,
 to be felt as painful, and to be felt as neither; and three qualities of
 the feeling — pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant.
 These triads are then collated and shown to originate in a conditional
 relationship: the quality of the object conditions the quality of the contact;
 the quality of the contact conditions the quality of the feeling.
 As the entire process is said to be contemplated by a bhikkhu endowed with
 understanding, this also implies that he has the capacity for overcoming
 the bondage to feelings by means of insight into their conditioned origination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) The Anguttara Nikaya
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Anguttara Nikaya offers two further examples of Maha Kaccana's exegetical
 skills.
 In one short sutta (AN 10:26) in this collection we see how the elder interpret
s a verse, the meaning of which seems completely explicit as it stands,
 by transposing it into a figurative mode and then extracting the implicit
 meaning by mapping it on to a framework of systematic doctrine.
 Here a woman lay disciple named Kali comes to the elder and asks him to
 explain in detail a verse from "The Girl's Questions." The reference is
 to the account of the Buddha's encounter with Mara's daughters when they
 tried to seduce him in the first year after his Enlightenment (SN 4:25).
 The daughter Tanha (Craving) had asked him why, instead of forming intimate
 relationships in the village, he squanders his time meditating alone in
 the woods.
 To this the Buddha replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable, Meditating alone
 I discovered bliss — The attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.
 Therefore I do not make friends with people, Nor does intimacy with anyone
 flourish for me."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is this verse that Kali asks the Venerable Maha Kaccana to elucidate.
 The elder explicates the verse in a way that does not appear to be derivable
 from the words themselves.
 His interpretation contrasts the Buddha's attitude to the kasinas — the
 meditations on special devices for inducing concentration21 — with that
 of other recluses and brahmans.
 He explains that some contemplatives, regarding the attainment of the earth
 kasina as the supreme goal, thereby generate this attainment.
 Others may take one of the other kasinas as supreme — the water kasina,
 the fire kasina, etc.
 — and reach the corresponding meditative state.
 But for each kasina, the Blessed One has directly understood to what extent
 it is supreme, and having understood this, he saw its origin, he saw the
 danger, he saw the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the true
 path and the wrong path.
 Having seen all this, he understood the attainment of the goal and the
 peace of the heart.
 It is in this way, the elder concludes, that the meaning of the above verse
 should be understood in detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interpreted by way of its apparent meaning, the verse seems to be extolling
 the bliss of secluded meditation above the pleasures of sensual and social
 contact — the very enjoyments with which Mara's daughters have been trying
 to tempt the Enlightened One.
 But the Venerable Maha Kaccana gives a different twist to the meaning.
 For him, the contrast is not merely between sensual pleasure and meditative
 bliss but between two different attitudes to advanced stages of meditative
 absorption.
 The ordinary recluses and brahmans understand the jhanas and other extraordinar
y states of consciousness attainable through the kasina meditations to be
 the final goal of spiritual endeavor.
 By doing so, they remain caught in the trap of craving for becoming and
 thus fail to find the way to final deliverance.
 Because they become attached to the exalted bliss and quiet serenity of
 the jhanas, they cannot see that these states too are conditioned and transient
, and thus they cannot relinquish their attachment to them.
 They therefore remain within Mara's domain, vanquished by his army of "agreeabl
e and pleasant forms," however sublime such may be.
 But the Buddha has seen the origin (adi)22 of these attainments, i.e., craving
 as the origin of suffering; he has seen the danger (adinava), i.e., that
 they are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change; he has seen
 the escape (nissarana) from them, i.e., Nibbana; and he has obtained the
 knowledge and vision by which he can distinguish the true path from the
 false, i.e., the Noble Eightfold Path from the wrong eightfold path.
 By means of this fourfold knowledge, which in effect is knowledge of the
 Four Noble Truths, he has attained the goal, Nibbana, experienced as the
 peace of heart that can arise only when all defilements have been extinguished
 without residue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, towards the end of the massive Anguttara Nikaya, we find one more
 sutta constructed on the same pattern as the three Majjhima Nikaya suttas.
 This sutta (AN 10:172) opens with a short statement of the Buddha:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Bhikkhus, non-dhamma should be understood, and so too dhamma should be
 understood.
 Harm should be understood, and benefit should be understood.
 Having understood all this, one should practice in accordance with dhamma,
 in accordance with benefit."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having said this, the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monks then approach the Venerable Maha Kaccana to request an explanation.
 Following the stock formulas of protest and insistence, Maha Kaccana interprets
 the Buddha's injunction by way of the ten unwholesome and ten wholesome
 courses of kamma: taking life is non-dhamma, abstaining from taking life
 is dhamma; the numerous evil unwholesome states that arise on account of
 taking life — this is harm; the numerous wholesome states that arise conditione
d by abstinence from taking life and that go to fulfillment by development
 — this is benefit.
 The same pattern is applied to stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, slander,
 harsh speech, and gossip.
 Finally, covetousness, ill will, and wrong view are non-dhamma, and the
 evil states that arise from them are harm; non-covetousness, goodwill,
 and right view are dhamma, and the wholesome states conditioned by them
 that go to fulfillment by development are benefit.

6.
 Other Teachings of Maha Kaccana
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all the discourses spoken by the Venerable Maha Kaccana take the form
 of commentaries on brief statements by the Buddha.
 He also delivered Dhamma talks that unfold along independent lines, and
 he was skilled too in resolving the doubts of inquirers and fellow monks
 with his own original insights into the Teaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Majjhima Nikaya contains a full-length dialogue between the great elder
 and King Avantiputta of Madhura, who was (according to the commentary)
 the grandson of King Candappajjota of Avanti.
 Once, when the Venerable Maha Kaccana was dwelling at Madhura, the king
 heard the favorable report that was circulating about him: "He is wise,
 discerning, sagacious, learned, articulate, and perspicacious; he is aged
 and he is an arahant." Desiring to converse with such a worthy monk, the
 king drove out to his hermitage to meet him, and the conversation that
 resulted has been recorded as the Madhura Sutta (MN 84).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question with which the king opened this dialogue did not concern a
 profound problem about the nature of reality or the deeper realizations
 of insight meditation.
 It revolved around a practical issue that must have been weighing heavily
 on the minds of many of the noble-caste rulers of the time: the attempts
 of the brahmans to establish their own hegemony over the entire Indian
 social system.
 The brahmans tried to justify this drive for power by appeal to their divinely
 ordained status.
 King Avantiputta relates to Maha Kaccana the claim that they had been putting
 forth: "The brahmans are the highest caste, those of any other caste are
 inferior; brahmans are the fairest caste, those of any other caste are
 dark; only brahmans are purified, not non-brahmans; brahmans alone are
 the sons of Brahma, the offspring of Brahma, born of his mouth, born of
 Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Venerable Maha Kaccana, though of pedigree brahman stock himself, is
 well aware of the presumption and arrogance that lay behind this proclamation.
 He replies that the claim of the brahmans is "just a saying in the world,"
 one with no divine sanction at all to support it.
 To prove his point Maha Kaccana brings forth a powerful array of arguments
 in its favor: one of any social class who gains wealth can command the
 labor of those in the other castes; even a menial could enrol a brahman
 in his service.
 One of any caste who violates the principles of morality would be reborn
 in hell, while one of any caste who observes the moral precepts would be
 reborn in a happy realm.
 One of any caste who breaks the law would be punished.
 One of any caste who renounces the world and becomes an ascetic would receive
 homage and respect.
 As each argument draws to a close, the king proclaims: "These four castes
 are all the same; there is no difference between them at all."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of the discussion, after expressing his appreciation of Master
 Kaccana's replies, King Avantiputta declares: "I go to Master Kaccana for
 refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus." But Maha Kaccana
 corrects him: "Do not go to me for refuge, great king.
 Go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge"
 — the Fully Enlightened Buddha.
 When the king asks where the Blessed One is now living, the elder explains
 that he has attained Parinibbana.
 This reply indicates that Maha Kaccana's own demise must have taken place
 at some date after that of the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Samyutta Nikaya includes a sutta (SN 35:132) that shows how the Venerable
 Maha Kaccana's skill in handling a group of rowdy young brahman boys helped
 to transform the attitude of a learned old brahman and his entourage of
 pupils.
 On one occasion the elder was living in Avanti in a forest hut.
 Then a number of young brahmans boys, pupils of the renowned brahman teacher
 Lohicca, drew near to the hut while collecting firewood.
 As the brahmans of that period often harbored hostile feelings towards
 the renunciant Buddhist monks, these boys, behaving as boys typically do
 when on a group outing, trampled around the hut, deliberately making a
 racket to disturb the meditating monk.
 They also shouted the words which the brahmans used to taunt the non-brahman
 ascetics: "These bald-pated ascetic rascals, menials, swarthy offspring
 of the Lord's feet, are honored, respected, esteemed, worshipped, and venerated
 by their servile devotees."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Venerable Maha Kaccana came out from the hut and addressed the boys
 with verses in which he reminded them of the ancient brahmanical ideals,
 so badly neglected by the brahmans of that day:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Those men of old who excelled in virtue, Those brahmans who recalled the
 ancient rules, Their sense doors guarded, well protected, Dwelt having
 vanquished wrath within.
 They took delight in Dhamma and meditation, Those brahmans who recalled
 the ancient rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But these have fallen, claiming 'We recite' While puffed up on account of
 their descent.
 They conduct themselves in unrighteous ways; Overcome by anger, armed with
 various weapons, They transgress against both weak and strong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For one who does not guard the sense doors (All the vows he undertakes)
 are vain Just like the wealth a man gains in a dream: Fasting and sleeping
 on the ground, Bathing at dawn, (study of) the Triple Veda, Rough hides,
 matted locks, and dirt; Hymns, rules and vows, austerities, Hypocrisy,
 crookedness, rinsing the mouth: These are the emblems of the brahmans Performed
 to increase their worldly gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mind that is well concentrated, Purified and free from blemish, Tender
 towards all sentient beings — That is the path for reaching Brahma."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On hearing this, the brahman boys were angry and displeased.
 On returning to their teacher, the brahman Lohicca, they reported that
 the recluse Maha Kaccana was denigrating and scorning the sacred brahman
 hymns.
 After his first flush of anger had subsided, Lohicca, being a man of sense,
 realized that he should not rush to conclusions merely on the basis of
 hearsay reported by youngsters, but should first inquire from Maha Kaccana
 himself whether there was any truth in their accusation.
 When Lohicca went to the Venerable Maha Kaccana and asked him about the
 conversation he had with the boys, Maha Kaccana reported everything as
 it occurred.
 Lohicca was deeply impressed by Maha Kaccana's poem on the proper brahman
 way of life, and even more so by the elder's following discourse on how
 to guard the doors of the senses.
 At the end of the discussion not only did he go for refuge to the Triple
 Gem, but he invited the elder to visit his household, assuring him that
 "the brahman boys and maidens there will pay homage to Master Kaccana;
 they will stand up for him out of respect; they will offer him a seat and
 water; and that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Venerable Maha Kaccana seems to have had a particularly deep insight
 into the causal basis of human quarrels and disputes.
 We have already seen how he traces out the causal roots of conflict in
 his exposition in the Madhupindika Sutta and his skill in transforming
 Lohicca's retinue of disciples.
 On another occasion (AN 2:4:6) a brahman named Aramadanda came to him and
 asked: "Why is society rent by such bitter conflicts — conflicts that pit
 nobles against nobles, brahmans against brahmans, householders against
 householders?" To this the elder replies: "It is because of sensual lust,
 attachment, greed, and obsession with sensual pleasures, that nobles fight
 with nobles, brahmans with brahmans, householders with householders." Next
 Aramadanda asked: "Why is it that recluses fight with recluses?" And Maha
 Kaccana replies: "It is because of lust for views, attachment, greed, and
 obsession with views, that recluses fight with recluses." Finally the brahman
 asked whether there was anyone in the world who had transcended both sensual
 lust and lust for views.
 Although Maha Kaccana, as an arahant, could have put himself forth as an
 example of such a one, with characteristic modesty and self-effacement
 he named instead the Blessed One, who was dwelling at Savatthi at the time.
 When this was said, the brahman Aramadanda knelt down on the ground, held
 out his hands in reverential salutation, and exclaimed three times: "Homage
 to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next sutta (AN 2:4:7) a brahman named Kandarayana reproaches Maha
 Kaccana for not showing proper respect towards aged brahmans.
 The elder defends himself by distinguishing the conventional usage of the
 words "aged" and "young" from their proper meaning within the Discipline
 of the Noble One.
 On this latter criterion, even if a person is eighty, ninety, or a hundred
 years from birth, if he is still addicted to sensual pleasures he is reckoned
 as a fool, not an elder.
 But even if a person is young, with jet black hair, endowed with the blessing
 of youth, if he has broken free from sensual desires, he is then reckoned
 as an elder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the Venerable Maha Kaccana gave the monks a discourse on the six recollecti
ons (cha anussati) — the contemplations of the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha,
 virtue, generosity, and the devas (AN 6:26).
 He declared that it is wonderful and marvellous how the Blessed One has
 discovered these six recollections as the way to freedom for those still
 trapped in the confines of the world.
 He describes the six recollections in exactly the same terms that the Buddha
 himself has used to describe the four foundations of mindfulness.
 They are the means "for the purification of beings, for the overcoming
 of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and grief, for
 the arrival at the right method, and for the realization of Nibbana."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On another occasion (AN 6:28) some elder bhikkhus were holding a discussion
 about the right time to approach "a monk worthy of esteem" (manobhavaniyo
 bhikkhu).
 One said he should be approached after he has finished his meal, another
 said he should he approached in the evening, while still another contended
 that the early morning was the most fitting time to speak with him.
 Unable to reach accord, they came to Maha Kaccana with their problem.
 The elder replied that there were six proper times for approaching a worthy
 monk.
 The first five are when the mind is overcome and obsessed by the five mental
 hindrances — sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and
 remorse, and doubt — and one cannot find an outlet from them on one's own.
 The sixth occasion to approach is when one does not know a suitable object
 to attend to in order to reach the destruction of the cankers (asavakkhaya).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was not always with words that the Venerable Maha Kaccana taught, but
 also by silent example.
 On one such occasion the Buddha was moved to extol Maha Kaccana in an udana
 — an inspired utterance — preserved for us in the canonical collection
 of that name (Ud.
 7:8).
 One evening the Buddha was seated in his cottage at Jeta's Grove in Savatthi
 when he saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana nearby "sitting cross-legged, holding
 his body erect, having mindfulness with regard to the body set up and well
 established within him." On realizing the significance of this, the Blessed
 One uttered this inspired utterance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"He who always has mindfulness Continually established on the body thus:
 'If there had not been, there would not be for me; There will not be, so
 there will not be for me,' If he dwell therein in graded steps In time
 he will pass beyond attachment."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In its explanation of this sutta, the Udana Commentary helps shed light
 on the approach that the Venerable Maha Kaccana adopted to reach arahantship.
 While this explanation conflicts with the account of the elder's "instantaneous
 enlightenment" found in the biographical sketch of the Anguttara Commentary
 (see above, p.
 7), it appears more realistic.
 The Udana Commentary explains that in his endeavor to attain arahantship,
 Maha Kaccana first developed jhana using mindfulness of the body (kayagata
 sati) as his subject of meditation.
 Utilizing that jhana as his foundation of calm concentration, he then redirecte
d mindfulness of the body on to the track of insight meditation (vipassana).
 With the wisdom of insight that arose from the contemplation of the body,
 he reached the supramundane paths and fruits, culminating in the final
 fruit of arahantship.
 Thereafter he would regularly resort to this same approach in order to
 enter upon the fruition attainment of arahantship (arahattaphala-samapatti),
 the special meditative absorption, unique to the arahant, in which the
 bliss of Nibbana is experienced even in this very life.
 It was just on such an occasion, when the elder was sitting absorbed in
 fruition attainment, that the Buddha caught sight of him and extolled him
 in this inspirational verse.
 The couplet by which the Buddha expresses the theme of contemplation is
 taken, by the commentary, to signify "four-cornered emptiness" (catukoti-suññat
a): the absence of "I" and "mine" in the past and present ("If there had
 not been, there would not be for me"), and the absence of "I" and "mine"
 in the future ("There will not be, so there will not be for me").
 By applauding the Venerable Maha Kaccana with this inspired utterance,
 the Buddha has held him up as a model for others to emulate in their own
 quest to overcome attachment to the world.

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 The Theragatha Verses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Theragatha, the verses of the ancient elders, includes eight verses
 ascribed to the Venerable Maha Kaccana (vv.494-501).
 These verses are in no way exceptional and merely express, in verse form,
 injunctions to proper discipline for monks and practical advice for householder
s.
 Although Maha Kaccana's verses addressed to the brahman Lohicca did serve
 effectively as a didactic tool, he does not seem to have been as amply
 endowed with the gift of poetic expression as several of the other great
 disciples, such as Maha Kassapa, Sariputta, and Vangisa.
 His sphere of excellence was analysis and exegesis, not inspirational eloquence
 or artistic creativity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first two verses (vv.494-95), according to the commentary, were spoken
 as an exhortation to the bhikkhus.
 One day the elder had noticed that a number of monks had laid aside their
 meditation practice in order to delight in work and in company.
 They were also growing too fond of the delicious food provided by their
 devoted lay supporters.
 He therefore admonished them thus:23
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"One should not do much work One should avoid people, One should not bustle
 (to obtain gifts).
 One who is eager and greedy for flavors Misses the goal that entails happiness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They knew as a bog this homage and veneration Obtained among devoted families.
 A subtle dart, difficult to extract, Honor is hard for a vile man to discard."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other six verses, again according to the commentary, were spoken as
 exhortations to King Candappajjota.
 The king, it is said, placed faith in the brahmans and at their behest
 performed animal sacrifices; he also would impose penalties and confer
 favors arbitrarily, presumably on account of that impulsive temperament
 of his that earned him the title "the Violent." Therefore, to dissuade the
 king from such reckless behavior, the elder recited the next four verses
 (496-99):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is not on account of another That a mortal's kamma is evil.
 On one's own accord one should not resort to evil, For mortals have kamma
 as their kinsmen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One is not a thief by another's word, One is not a sage by another's word;
 It is as one knows oneself That the devas also know one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Others do not understand That we all come to an end here.
 But those wise ones who understand this Thereby settle their quarrels.24
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wise man lives indeed Even despite the loss of his wealth.
 But if one does not obtain wisdom, Then even though rich one is not alive."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last two stanzas (500-501) were spoken by the elder when the king came
 to him one day and informed him of a disturbing dream he had seen the previous
 night:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"One hears all with the ear, One sees all with the eye, The wise man should
 not reject Everything that is seen and heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One with eyes should be as if blind, One with ears as if deaf, One with
 wisdom as if mute, One with strength as if feeble.
 Then, when the goal has been attained, One may lie upon one's death bed."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commentary explains the purport of the verses thus: A wise person should
 not reject everything, but should first investigate virtues and faults
 and then should reject whatever should be rejected and accept whatever
 is acceptable.
 Therefore, in regard to what should be rejected, though one possesses vision
 one should be as if blind, and though able to hear, one should be as if
 deaf.
 One who is intelligent, able to speak well, should be as if dumb when tempted
 to speak what is unfit to be uttered; and one who is strong should be as
 if feeble in regard to what should not be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last line is ambiguous, in the Pali as well, and is interpreted in two
 different ways by the commentary: (1) When a task that should be done has
 arisen, one should investigate it and not neglect it even if one is lying
 on one's death bed.
 (2) Or alternatively, if a task that one should not do has arisen, one
 should prefer to die — to lie down on one's death bed — rather than do
 it.
 Neither explanation sounds convincing, and the sense consonant with the
 spirit of the Theragatha as a whole would seem to be: One should die as
 one who has attained the goal, i.e., as an arahant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 The Exegetical Treatises
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before concluding this survey of the Venerable Maha Kaccana's contribution
 to the Buddha's Dispensation, we should briefly take note that the Theravada
 tradition ascribes to him two exegetical treatises — the Petakopadesa and
 the Nettippakarana — and an influential grammar of the Pali language called
 the Kaccayana-Vyakarana.
 The two treatises are not included in the Pali canon (except in Burma,
 where they were lately incorporated into the Sutta Pitaka), but have exerted
 a major influence on the evolution of exegetical method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bhikkhu Ñanamoli, who translated both treatises into English, holds that
 the Netti is a later, more refined version of the Petakopadesa.25 Both deal
 with essentially the same method of exegesis, which in the Netti is clearer
 and more concise.
 The method described there is designed to elicit from the Buddha's discourses
 the unifying principles that underlie the variegated expressions of the
 Dhamma.
 It is founded on the assumption that beneath the many diverse utterances
 of the Master, adapted according to the temperament and situation of the
 auditors, there runs a single consistent system, which with the right exegetica
l techniques can be extracted from the particular statement under investigation
 and displayed in its unadorned essence.
 The Netti, as Ven.
 Ñanamoli has explained, is not itself a commentary but a guide for commentators.
 It explicates, not so much the teachings themselves (except by way of exemplifi
cation), but the tools that are to be used to elicit the structural elements
 that underlie and shape the expression of the teachings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Netti sets up its methodology under two main headings, the phrasing
 (byanjana) and the meaning (attha).
 The phrasing is handled by sixteen "modes of conveyance" (hara), techniques
 of verbal and logical analysis that can be applied to any specified passage
 in order to extract the principles that lie behind the verbal formulation
 and logical organization of its content.
 The meaning is handled by three methods or "guidelines" (naya).
 These take the meaning to be the aim or goal of the doctrine (attha signifies
 both "meaning" and "goal"), which is the attainment of Nibbana, and they
 then disclose how the teaching in question points to the attainment of
 that goal as its underlying purport.
 Two additional methods are then proposed for correlating the sutta's terminolog
y with the methods for explicating the meaning.26 The method is applied by
 the subcommentaries to the first sutta of each of the four Nikayas in special
 supplements to the main portion of the subcommentary.27 A commentary on
 the Netti, attributed to Acariya Dhammapala, also exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The colophons of both exegetical treatises — the Petakopadesa and the Nettippaka
rana — attribute them to the Buddha's disciple Maha Kaccana.
 The Netti colophon states further that it was approved by the Blessed One
 and chanted at the original Buddhist Council.
 Western scholars have been inclined to dismiss the ascription of authorship
 to Maha Kaccana as fanciful.
 Ven.
 Ñanamoli, however, in the Introduction to his translation of the Nettippakarana
, offers an explanation that preserves at least a grain of credibility in
 the traditional Buddhist view without falling into the opposite extreme
 of credulity.28
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ven.
 Ñanamoli proposes that we distinguish between the authorship of the exegetical
 method on the one hand, and the authorship of the treatises on the other.
 He suggests as a hypothesis — possible though neither provable nor refutable
 — that the Elder Maha Kaccana and his lineage of pupils in Avanti may have
 formulated a compendious method for interpreting the Buddha's discourses,
 and that this method — or at least its elements — may have been discussed
 at the early Councils and transmitted orally in skeletal form.
 At a later date, the method could have given birth to a treatise, which
 attempts to coordinate its elements and to illustrate their application
 to specific texts.
 This treatise eventually became the Petakopadesa.
 Some time later, perhaps even centuries later, a more polished and perspicuous
 version of the same work was made, this being the Nettippakarana.
 As the original methodology embedded in these treatises was derived from
 the Venerable Maha Kaccana, or at any rate was believed to have been derived
 from him, out of reverence for its architect — and also to boost the prestige
 of the treatises — their compilers ascribed authorship to the elder.
 G.P.
 Malalasekera offers a parallel hypothesis to explain the imputed authorship
 of the Pali grammar, the Kaccayana-Vyakarana, to the Buddha's great disciple.29
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While such propositions must remain conjectural, as both Ven.
 Ñanamoli and Malalasekera themselves acknowledge, the type of detailed
 analysis of textual statements found in the Nettippakarana is consonant
 with the approach that the historical Maha Kaccana brought to bear on the
 interpretation of the Buddha's brief utterances.
 Thus it would seem that even if no direct connection actually exists between
 the great elder and the ancient Pali treatises ascribed to him, the fact
 remains that they embody the spirit that he represented.
 This spirit, so evident in the suttas that record his elucidations of the
 Buddha Word, couples acuity of insight with terseness of expression, precision
 of formulation with profundity of meaning.
 It was on the basis of such skills that the Enlightened One named him the
 foremost master of doctrinal exposition, and it is this that constitutes
 his outstanding contribution to the Buddha's Dispensation.

 Vin.ii,299, in describing the preparations for the Second Council, it is
 said that eighty-eight arahants from Avanti gathered on the Ahoganga mountain
 slope.
 They are described as "mostly forest-dwellers, mostly almsmen, mostly rag-robe
 wearers, mostly wearers of the three robes," and are contrasted with sixty
 arahant bhikkhus from Pava, all of whom observe these ascetic practices.
 Though any conclusions drawn from this passage are speculative, these monks
 may have belonged to the pupillary lineage of Ven.
 Maha Kaccana, and the reason they were "mostly" observers of the ascetic
 practices (rather than entirely such) is that he inspired his disciples
 to undertake such practices by personal example without making them mandatory.11.
Isidatta is mentioned at SN 41:1, 2.
 In the first sutta he answers a question on the diversity of elements,
 a topic that Maha Kaccana also discusses (see below, pp.

 replies, he disappeared into obscurity.12.Dhp.

The Dhammapada
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Translated by Thomas Byrom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhammapada, an anthology of 423 verses, has long been recognised as
 one of the masterpieces of early Buddhist literature.
 From ancient times to the present, the Dhammapada has been regarded as
 the most succinct expression of the Buddha's teaching found in the Theravada
 Pali Canon of scriptures known as the Khuddaka Nikaya ("Minor Collection")
 of the Sutta Pitaka.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddhist tradition has it that shortly after the passing away of the Buddha
 his disciples met in council at Rajagaha for the purpose of recalling to
 mind the truths they had received from their beloved Teacher during the
 forty-five years of his ministry.
 Their hope was to implant the principles of his message so firmly in memory
 that they would become a lasting impetus to moral and spiritual conduct,
 for themselves, their disciples, and for all future disciples who would
 seek to follow in the footsteps of the Awakened One.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the Teacher no longer among them, the monks found themselves with the
 responsibility of handing on the teaching as faithfully as possible.
 Having no written texts to rely on, they did as their ancestors had before
 them and prepared their discourses for recitation, that is, basic themes
 were repeated with variations in order to impress the ideas on their hearers.
 At that time, according to the Sinhalese, the Dhammapada was orally assembled
 from the sayings of Gautama given on some three hundred different occasions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently, several renditions of the Dhammapada in the Sanskrit and Chinese
 languages came into circulation.
 Likewise, a number of stanzas are to be found almost verbatim in other
 texts of the canonical literature, testifying to the esteem in which its
 content was anciently held.
 Since first collated, the Dhammapada has become one of the best loved of
 Buddhist scriptures, recited daily by millions of devotees who chant its
 verses in Pali or in their native dialect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was inevitable that differences in interpretation of teaching as well
 as of disciplinary practices would arise, with the result that about a
 century after the First Council was held a second gathering was called
 to affirm the purity of the doctrine.
 It was at this Second Council that the Arhats divided into two main streams,
 namely, the Mahasanghika or "Great Assembly" and the Theravada or "Doctrine
 of Elders." These gradually developed into the Mahayana or Northern School
 of Buddhism espoused chiefly in India, Tibet, China, and later Japan, and
 the Hinayana or Southern School whose stronghold is Sri Lanka, Burma, and
 the countries of Southeast Asia.

\begin_layout Standard
The Noble Eightfold Path describes the way to the end of suffering, as it
 was laid out by Siddhartha Gautama.
 It is a practical guideline to ethical and mental development with the
 goal of freeing the individual from attachments and delusions; and it finally
 leads to understanding the truth about all things.
 Together with the Four Noble Truths it constitutes the gist of Buddhism.
 Great emphasis is put on the practical aspect, because it is only through
 practice that one can attain a higher level of existence and finally reach
 Nirvana.
 The eight aspects of the path are not to be understood as a sequence of
 single steps, instead they are highly interdependent principles that have
 to be seen in relationship with each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Right View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right view is the beginning and the end of the path, it simply means to
 see and to understand things as they really are and to realise the Four
 Noble Truth.
 As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom.
 It means to see things through, to grasp the impermanent and imperfect
 nature of worldly objects and ideas, and to understand the law of karma
 and karmic conditioning.
 Right view is not necessarily an intellectual capacity, just as wisdom
 is not just a matter of intelligence.
 Instead, right view is attained, sustained, and enhanced through all capacities
 of mind.
 It begins with the intuitive insight that all beings are subject to suffering
 and it ends with complete understanding of the true nature of all things.
 Since our view of the world forms our thoughts and our actions, right view
 yields right thoughts and right actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Right Intention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While right view refers to the cognitive aspect of wisdom, right intention
 refers to the volitional aspect, i.e.
 the kind of mental energy that controls our actions.
 Right intention can be described best as commitment to ethical and mental
 self-improvement.
 Buddha distinguishes three types of right intentions: 1.
 the intention of renunciation, which means resistance to the pull of desire,
 2.
 the intention of good will, meaning resistance to feelings of anger and
 aversion, and 3.
 the intention of harmlessness, meaning not to think or act cruelly, violently,
 or aggressively, and to develop compassion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Right Speech
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right speech is the first principle of ethical conduct in the eightfold
 path.
 Ethical conduct is viewed as a guideline to moral discipline, which supports
 the other principles of the path.
 This aspect is not self-sufficient, however, essential, because mental
 purification can only be achieved through the cultivation of ethical conduct.
 The importance of speech in the context of Buddhist ethics is obvious:
 words can break or save lives, make enemies or friends, start war or create
 peace.
 Buddha explained right speech as follows: 1.
 to abstain from false speech, especially not to tell deliberate lies and
 not to speak deceitfully, 2.
 to abstain from slanderous speech and not to use words maliciously against
 others, 3.
 to abstain from harsh words that offend or hurt others, and 4.
 to abstain from idle chatter that lacks purpose or depth.
 Positively phrased, this means to tell the truth, to speak friendly, warm,
 and gently and to talk only when necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Right Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second ethical principle, right action, involves the body as natural
 means of expression, as it refers to deeds that involve bodily actions.
 Unwholesome actions lead to unsound states of mind, while wholesome actions
 lead to sound states of mind.
 Again, the principle is explained in terms of abstinence: right action
 means 1.
 to abstain from harming sentient beings, especially to abstain from taking
 life (including suicide) and doing harm intentionally or delinquently,
 2.
 to abstain from taking what is not given, which includes stealing, robbery,
 fraud, deceitfulness, and dishonesty, and 3.
 to abstain from sexual misconduct.
 Positively formulated, right action means to act kindly and compassionately,
 to be honest, to respect the belongings of others, and to keep sexual relations
hips harmless to others.
 Further details regarding the concrete meaning of right action can be found
 in the Precepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Right Livelihood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right livelihood means that one should earn one's living in a righteous
 way and that wealth should be gained legally and peacefully.
 The Buddha mentions four specific activities that harm other beings and
 that one should avoid for this reason: 1.
 dealing in weapons, 2.
 dealing in living beings (including raising animals for slaughter as well
 as slave trade and prostitution), 3.
 working in meat production and butchery, and 4.
 selling intoxicants and poisons, such as alcohol and drugs.
 Furthermore any other occupation that would violate the principles of right
 speech and right action should be avoided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Right Effort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right effort can be seen as a prerequisite for the other principles of the
 path.
 Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing can be achieved,
 whereas misguided effort distracts the mind from its task, and confusion
 will be the consequence.
 Mental energy is the force behind right effort; it can occur in either
 wholesome or unwholesome states.
 The same type of energy that fuels desire, envy, aggression, and violence
 can on the other side fuel self-discipline, honesty, benevolence, and kindness.
 Right effort is detailed in four types of endeavours that rank in ascending
 order of perfection: 1.
 to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states, 2.
 to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen, 3.
 to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen, and 4.
 to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Right Mindfulness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right mindfulness is the controlled and perfected faculty of cognition.
 It is the mental ability to see things as they are, with clear consciousness.
 Usually, the cognitive process begins with an impression induced by perception,
 or by a thought, but then it does not stay with the mere impression.
 Instead, we almost always conceptualise sense impressions and thoughts
 immediately.
 We interpret them and set them in relation to other thoughts and experiences,
 which naturally go beyond the facticity of the original impression.
 The mind then posits concepts, joins concepts into constructs, and weaves
 those constructs into complex interpretative schemes.
 All this happens only half consciously, and as a result we often see things
 obscured.
 Right mindfulness is anchored in clear perception and it penetrates impressions
 without getting carried away.
 Right mindfulness enables us to be aware of the process of conceptualisation
 in a way that we actively observe and control the way our thoughts go.
 Buddha accounted for this as the four foundations of mindfulness: 1.
 contemplation of the body, 2.
 contemplation of feeling (repulsive, attractive, or neutral), 3.
 contemplation of the state of mind, and 4.
 contemplation of the phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 Right Concentration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eighth principle of the path, right concentration, refers to the development
 of a mental force that occurs in natural consciousness, although at a relativel
y low level of intensity, namely concentration.
 Concentration in this context is described as one-pointedness of mind,
 meaning a state where all mental faculties are unified and directed onto
 one particular object.
 Right concentration for the purpose of the eightfold path means wholesome
 concentration, i.e.
 concentration on wholesome thoughts and actions.
 The Buddhist method of choice to develop right concentration is through
 the practice of meditation.
 The meditating mind focuses on a selected object.
 It first directs itself onto it, then sustains concentration, and finally
 intensifies concentration step by step.
 Through this practice it becomes natural to apply elevated levels concentration
 also in everyday situations.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctrine of kamma (karma — action) is one of the Buddha's central teachings.
 There is a modern myth that he simply picked up his ideas on kamma from
 the worldview prevalent in his day, and that they aren't really integral
 to his message.
 Nothing could be further from the truth.
 Early Buddhists often cited the Buddha's teaching on kamma as one of the
 prime teachings that set him apart from his contemporaries, and a study
 of his teachings on kamma will show that they underlie everything else
 he taught.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following readings from the Pali canon are designed to give an overview
 of the Buddha's teachings on kamma.
 Before tackling them, you might want to read a few introductory articles
 on the topic, including the following ones available on Access to Insight:
 "Karma," "A Refuge in Skillful Action" (contained in the book, Refuge),
 and "Samsara Divided by Zero."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The readings here are divided into three main sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-Buddhist theories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Skillfulness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kamma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first section provides background for the Buddhist teachings on kamma
 by showing how the early Buddhists viewed the way other contemporary schools
 of thought explained kamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second section focuses on the Buddha's basic observation that underlay
 his teachings on kamma: that it is possible to develop a skill.
 This simple fact carries a number of important implications for any teaching
 on action.
 (1) Actions give results, and their results follow a discernible pattern.
 Otherwise, it would not be possible to develop a skill.
 (2) Some results are more desirable than others.
 Otherwise, there would be no point in developing a skill.
 (3) By observing one's mistakes one may learn from them and use that knowledge
 to act more skillfully in the future.
 This means that the mind is a crucial agent in determining actions and
 their results, and there is an opening for feedback to influence the process
 of action.
 It is thus a non-linear process, and there is room for free will.
 (4) Results can be observed while one is acting, as well as after the action
 is done.
 This means that actions have both immediate results and long-term results,
 a fact that makes the non-linear process very complex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The passages in the second section discuss how these observations apply
 in practice.
 §5 discusses how the Buddha applied the principle of skillfulness to reach
 Awakening.
 §7 shows how to use it to decide what teachings are valid.
 §8 discusses how to apply it to all of one's actions.
 The remaining passages are self-explanatory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third section, on kamma, consists of passages that build a larger theory
 of action based on these observations.
 These passages are divided into three sub-sections, based on a classification
 given in §14:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kamma & Causes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diversity & Cessation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sub-section A is the most theoretical part of this study guide.
 It covers the Buddha's basic theory of causation (§15) and treats the place
 of intention — the factor that the Buddha identified as the essence of
 kamma — in the context of the Buddha's analysis of physical and mental
 phenomena (name-&-form).
 In the light of the Buddha's observation in §5 that views influence kamma
 (views come under attention in the analysis of "name"), this sub-section
 concludes with two levels of right view: mundane right view, which informs
 the sort of good kamma that brings about happy results within the process
 of death and rebirth; and transcendent right view, which informs the sort
 of kamma that brings freedom from that process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sub-section B focuses on the issue of how long it takes for the results
 of kamma to appear, and gives particular attention to some of the complexities
 that arise from the fact that kamma is non-linear.
 Sometimes the results of an action don't appear immediately, or even in
 the immediate next life.
 §27 discusses the role that the mind plays in determining how the results
 of kamma are experienced, and §28 treats the intelligent way to use the
 Buddha's teachings on kamma when reflecting on one's own past bad kamma
 so as to train oneself in the proper frame of mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sub-section C is divided into two further sub-sections, based on a classificatio
n in §29:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dark Kamma, Bright Kamma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kamma Neither Dark nor Bright
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first of these two sub-sections discusses types of actions and mental
 qualities that lead to good or bad results within the process of rebirth
 and death.
 In some passages the emphasis is on results in the present life; in others,
 on results in future lives.
 The second of these two sub-sections discusses the type of kamma — and
 the right views underlying that kamma — leading to freedom: the cessation
 of kamma, the realization of nibbana.
 The concluding passages make the point that transcendent right view contains
 the seeds for its own transcendence: once it has done its duty in cutting
 away other attachments, it creates the momentum so that the mind can then
 abandon attachment to views of any sort, right or wrong, mundane or transcenden
t.
 That is how true freedom is gained.

 Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what
 is not given.
 He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness
 that belong to others and have not been given by them.
 Abandoning illicit sex, he abstains from illicit sex.
 He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their
 mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives,

"And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action? There is the case
 where a certain person, abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech.
 When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering
 of his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty, if he is asked as a witness,
 'Come & tell, good man, what you know': If he doesn't know, he says, 'I
 don't know.' If he does know, he says, 'I know.' If he hasn't seen, he says,
 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't
 consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for
 the sake of any reward.
 Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech.
 He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver
 of the world.
 Abandoning divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech.
 What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart
 from these people here.
 What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart
 from those people there.
 Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are
 united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things
 that create concord.
 Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech.
 He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that
 go to the heart, that are polite, appealing & pleasing to people at large.
 Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter.
 He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with
 the goal, the Dhamma, & the Vinaya.
 He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed,
 connected with the goal.

 the resolves of his heart.
 [He thinks,] 'May these beings be free from animosity, free from oppression,
 free from trouble, and may they look after themselves with ease!' He has
 right view and is not warped in the way he sees things: 'There is what
 is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed.
 There are fruits & results of good & bad actions.
 There is this world & the next world.
 There is mother & father.
 There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are priests & contemplatives

 "No other ground is found" means that the fruit of the action is not experience
d by any other person's chain of rebirth.2.The Commentary notes that this
 verse refers to the attainment of arahantship, and that an arahant — in
 reaching nibbana — sheds not only bad destinations, but also good ones.

 Having developed a mind of good will for seven years, then for seven aeons

 Then for thirty-six times I was Sakka, ruler of the gods.
 For many hundreds of times I was a king, a wheel-turning emperor, a righteous
 king of Dhamma, conqueror of the four corners of the earth, maintaining
 stable control over the countryside, endowed with the seven treasures*
 — to say nothing of the times I was a local king.

 of what action the result, that I now have such great power & might?' Then

 He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare,

\begin_layout Standard
The recent upsurge of interest in Buddhism, both East and West, has been
 marked by a vigorous practical orientation and a drive to discover the
 peace and freedom to which the practice of Dhamma leads.
 This zeal for practice, however, has often been accompanied by another
 trait which may not be so fruitful, namely, a tendency to neglect or even
 belittle the methodical study of the Buddha's teachings.
 The arguments offered in defense of this attitude have already become familiar
 currency among us.
 It is said, for example, that study is concerned with words and concepts,
 not with realities; that it leads only to learning, not to wisdom; that
 it can change only our ideas but fails to touch us at the deeper levels
 of our lives.
 To clinch the case the testimony of the Buddha himself is enlisted, with
 his famous remarks that to learn much without practicing is like counting
 the cows of others or like carrying a raft on one's head instead of using
 it to cross the stream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This contention, to be sure, has its aspect of truth, but also suffers from
 a one-sided emphasis which may actually thwart rather than aid our progress
 on the Buddhist path.
 It is certainly true that learning without practice is fruitless, but the
 other side of the issue also should be considered.
 Should a person gather cows if he knows nothing about how to take care
 of them? Should he try to cross a rough and dangerous river without knowing
 how to operate a raft? The Buddha himself insisted that his followers learn
 and transmit the Dhamma both in the letter and the spirit, but rather than
 appealing to traditional formulations, let us inquire ourselves into the
 value and function of Dhamma study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point at issue, it must be stressed, is not study as an academic discipline
 or the accumulation of a wealth of learning, but the acquisition of a sound
 and solid working knowledge of the basic Buddhist doctrines.
 Now to see why this is so essential, we must recall that the entire practice
 of the proper Buddhist path develops out of the act through which we enter
 the path — the going for refuge to the Triple Gem.
 If we have taken this step honestly, with correct motivation, it implies
 that we have acknowledged our need for spiritual guidance and have entrusted
 ourselves to the Buddha as our guide and to his teaching as our vehicle
 of guidance.
 By taking refuge in the Dhamma we accept not merely a technique of meditation
 that we can use at liberty for our own self-appointed purposes, but a profound
 and comprehensive teaching on the true nature of the human condition, a
 teaching designed to awaken in us a perception of this truth as the means
 for reaching the full and final end of suffering.
 The liberation offered by the Dhamma comes, not from simply practicing
 meditation in the context of our own preconceptions and desires, but from
 practicing upon the groundwork of the right understanding and right intentions
 communicated to us by the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This cognitive character of the Buddhist path elevates doctrinal study and
 intellectual inquiry to a position of great importance.
 Though the knowledge that frees the mind from bondage emerges only from
 intuitive insight and not from a mass of doctrinal facts, genuine insight
 always develops on the basis of a preliminary conceptual grasp of the basic
 principles essential to right understanding, in the absence of which its
 growth will inevitably be obstructed.
 The study and systematic reflection through which we arrive at this preparatory
 right view necessarily involve concepts and ideas.
 But before we hasten to dismiss Dhamma study as being therefore only a
 worthless tangle of verbiage, let us consider that concepts and ideas are
 our indispensable tools of understanding and communication.
 Concepts, however, can be valid and invalid tools of understanding; ideas
 can be fruitful or useless, capable of bringing immense benefit or of entailing
 enormous harm.
 The object of studying the Dhamma as part of our spiritual quest is to
 learn to comprehend our experience correctly: to be able to distinguish
 the valid from the invalid, the true from the false, the wholesome from
 the unwholesome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is only by making a thorough and careful investigation that we will be
 in a position to reject what is detrimental to our growth and to apply
 ourselves with confidence to cultivating what is truly beneficial.
 Without having reached this preliminary conceptual clarification, without
 having succeeded in "straightening out our views," there can indeed be
 the earnest practice of Buddhist meditation techniques, but there will
 not be the practice of the meditation pertaining to the integral Noble
 Eightfold Path.
 And while such free-based meditation may bring its practitioners the mundane
 benefits of greater calm, awareness and equanimity, lacking the guidance
 of right view and the driving power of right motivation, it is questionable
 whether it can lead to the penetrative realization of the Dhamma, or to
 its final goal, the complete cessation of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is almost impossible to give a single word of counsel on the subject
 of study applicable to all followers of the Dhamma.
 Needs and interests vary so greatly from one person to another that each
 will have to strike the balance between study and practice that suits his
 or her own disposition.
 But without hesitation it can be said that all who earnestly endeavor to
 live by the Buddha's teaching will find their practice strengthened by
 the methodical study of his Dhamma.
 Such an undertaking, of course, will not be easy, but it is just through
 facing and surmounting the challenges we meet that our understanding will
 ripen and mature in the higher wisdom.

The Vinaya Pitaka, the first division of the Tipitaka, is the textual framework
 upon which the monastic community (Sangha) is built.
 It includes not only the rules governing the life of every Theravada bhikkhu
 (monk) and bhikkhuni (nun), but also a host of procedures and conventions
 of etiquette that support harmonious relations, both among the monastics
 themselves, and between the monastics and their lay supporters, upon whom
 they depend for all their material needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Buddha first established the Sangha, the community initially lived
 in harmony without any codified rules of conduct.
 As the Sangha gradually grew in number and evolved into a more complex
 society, occasions inevitably arose when a member would act in an unskillful
 way.
 Whenever one of these cases was brought to the Buddha's attention, he would
 lay down a rule establishing a suitable punishment for the offense, as
 a deterrent to future misconduct.
 The Buddha's standard reprimand was itself a powerful corrective:

The monastic tradition and the rules upon which it is built are sometimes
 naïvely criticized — particularly here in the West — as irrelevant to the
 "modern" practice of Buddhism.
 Some see the Vinaya as a throwback to an archaic patriarchy, based on a
 hodge-podge of ancient rules and customs — quaint cultural relics that
 only obscure the essence of "true" Buddhist practice.
 This misguided view overlooks one crucial fact: it is thanks to the unbroken
 lineage of monastics who have consistently upheld and protected the rules
 of the Vinaya for almost 2,600 years that we find ourselves today with
 the luxury of receiving the priceless teachings of Dhamma.
 Were it not for the Vinaya, and for those who continue to keep it alive

It helps to keep in mind that the name the Buddha gave to the spiritual
 path he taught was "Dhamma-vinaya" — the Doctrine (Dhamma) and Discipline
 (Vinaya) — suggesting an integrated body of wisdom and ethical training.
 The Vinaya is thus an indispensable facet and foundation of all the Buddha's
 teachings, inseparable from the Dhamma, and worthy of study by all followers
 — lay and ordained, alike.
 Lay practitioners will find in the Vinaya Pitaka many valuable lessons
 concerning human nature, guidance on how to establish and maintain a harmonious
 community or organization, and many profound teachings of the Dhamma itself.
 But its greatest value, perhaps, lies in its power to inspire the layperson
 to consider the extraordinary possibilities presented by a life of true
 renunciation, a life lived fully in tune with the Dhamma.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Sammaditthi Sutta, the Discourse on Right View, is the ninth sutta of
 the Majjhima Nikaya, the Collection of Middle Length Discourses.
 Its expositor is the Venerable Sariputta Thera, the Buddha's chief disciple
 and the foremost of the Master's bhikkhu disciples in the exercise of the
 faculty of wisdom.
 The Buddha declared that next to himself, it was the Venerable Sariputta
 who excelled in turning the incomparable Wheel of the Dhamma, in expounding
 in depth and in detail the Four Noble Truths realized with the attainment
 of enlightenment.
 In the Sammaditthi Sutta the great disciple bears ample testimony to the
 Buddha's words of praise, bequeathing upon us a discourse that has served
 as a primer of Buddhist doctrine for generations of monks in the monasteries
 of South and Southeast Asia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As its title suggests, the subject of the Sammaditthi Sutta is right view.
 The analysis of right view undertaken in the sutta brings us to the very
 core of the Dhamma, since right view constitutes the correct understanding
 of the central teachings of the Buddha, the teachings which confer upon
 the Buddha's doctrine its own unique and distinctive stamp.
 Though the practice of right mindfulness has rightly been extolled as the
 crest jewel of the Buddha's teaching, it cannot be stressed strongly enough
 that the practice of mindfulness, or any other approach to meditation,
 only becomes an effective instrument of liberation to the extent that it
 is founded upon and guided by right view.
 Hence, to confirm the importance of right view, the Buddha places it at
 the very beginning of the Noble Eightfold Path.
 Elsewhere in the Suttas the Buddha calls right view the forerunner of the
 path (pubbangama), which gives direction and efficacy to the other seven
 path factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right view, as explained in the commentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta, has
 a variety of aspects, but it might best be considered as twofold: conceptual
 right view, which is the intellectual grasp of the principles enunciated
 in the Buddha's teaching, and experiential right view, which is the wisdom
 that arises by direct penetration of the teaching.
 Conceptual right view, also called the right view in conformity with the
 truths (saccanulomika-sammaditthi), is a correct conceptual understanding
 of the Dhamma arrived at by study of the Buddha's teachings and deep examinatio
n of their meaning.
 Such understanding, though conceptual rather than experiential, is not
 dry and sterile.
 When rooted in faith in the Triple Gem and driven by a keen aspiration
 to realize the truth embedded in the formulated principles of the Dhamma,
 it serves as a critical phase in the development of wisdom (pañña), for
 it provides the germ out of which experiential right view gradually evolves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiential right view is the penetration of the truth of the teaching
 in one's own immediate experience.
 Thus it is also called right view that penetrates the truths (saccapativedha-sa
mmaditthi).
 This type of right view is aroused by the practice of insight meditation
 guided by a correct conceptual understanding of the Dhamma.
 To arrive at direct penetration, one must begin with a correct conceptual
 grasp of the teaching and transform that grasp from intellectual comprehension
 to direct perception by cultivating the threefold training in morality,
 concentration and wisdom.
 If conceptual right view van be compared to a hand, a hand that grasps
 the truth by way of concepts, then experiential right view can be compared
 to an eye — the eye of wisdom that sees directly into the true nature of
 existence ordinarily hidden from us by our greed, aversion and delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Discourse on Right View is intended to elucidate the principles that
 are to be comprehended by conceptual right view and penetrated by experiential
 right view.
 The Venerable Sariputta expounds these principles under sixteen headings:
 the wholesome and the unwholesome, the four nutriments of life, the Four
 Noble Truths, the twelve factors of dependent arising, and the taints as
 the condition for ignorance.
 It will be noted that from the second section to the end of the sutta,
 all the expositions are framed in accordance with the same structure, which
 reveals the principle of conditionality as the scaffolding for the entire
 teaching.
 Each phenomenon to be comprehended by right view is expounded in terms
 of its individual nature, its arising, its cessation, and the way leading
 to its cessation.
 The grasp of this principle thus makes it clear that any entity taken for
 examination is not an isolated occurrence with its being locked up in itself,
 but part of a web of conditionally arisen processes that can be terminated
 by understanding and eliminating the cause that gives it being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right view arrived at by penetrating any of the sixteen subjects expounded
 in the sutta is discussed in terms of two aspects, both aspects of supramundane
 penetration.
 The first is the initial penetration of the supramundane path that transforms
 a person from a worldling (puthujjana) into a stream-enterer (sotapanna),
 a noble disciple who has entered irreversibly upon the stream to liberation.
 This aspect of right view is indicated by the words that open each section,
 "(one) who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this
 true Dhamma." These qualities are attributes only of the stream-enterer
 and those of higher attainment along the path.
 The description thus applies to the trainee (sekha), the disciple who has
 entered the path but has not yet reached its end.
 The words signify right view as a transformative vision which has revealed
 the ultimate truths underlying our existence, but which must still be developed
 further to complete the full transformation it is capable of effecting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second aspect of supramundane right view is indicated by the closing
 words of each section, from "he entirely abandons the underlying tendency
 to lust" to "he here and now makes an end of suffering." This description
 is fully applicable only to the arahant, the liberated one, and thus indicates
 that the right view conceptually grasped by the wise worldling, and transformed
 into direct perception with the attainment of stream-entry, reaches its
 consummation with the arrival at the teaching's final goal, the attainment
 of complete emancipation from suffering.

The translation of the Sammaditthi Sutta and its commentary presented here
 has been adapted from manuscripts left behind by Bhikkhu Ñanamoli.
 The translation of the sutta has been adapted from Ven.
 Ñanamoli's complete translation of the Majjhima Nikaya.
 The version used has been taken from the edition of the complete Majjhima
 Nikaya translation that I prepared for publication by Wisdom Publications
 in the United States.
 This version, tentatively scheduled for release in late 1992, employs extensive
 substitution of Ven.
 Ñanamoli's own technical terminology with my own preferred renderings of
 Pali doctrinal terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta is from the Papañcasudani, Acariya
 Buddhaghosa's complete commentary (atthakatha) to the Majjhima Nikaya.
 The translation of the commentary has also been adapted from a rendering
 by Ven.
 Ñanamoli, contained in a notebook of his that was discovered only a few
 years ago at Island Hermitage.
 The terminology used in the notebook version suggests that it was one of
 Ven.
 Ñanamoli's earliest attempts at translation from the Pali; it certainly
 preceded his translation of the Visuddhimagga, The Path of Purification,
 first completed at the end of 1953.
 In adapting the translation, I have naturally replaced the technical terminolog
y used in the notebook version with that used in the sutta.
 In places I also decided to translate directly from the Pali text rather
 than adhere to Ven.
 Ñanamoli's rendering, which sometimes tended to be literal to the point
 of awkwardness.
 A few passages from the commentary that are concerned solely with linguistic
 clarification have been omitted from the translation.

Part Two: The Commentary to the Discourse on Right View
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Thus have I heard: the Sammaditthi Sutta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Herein, all such questions spoken by the Elder as " 'One of right view,
 one of right view' is said, friends.
 In what way is a noble disciple one of right view...?" or "And what, friends,
 is the unwholesome...?" — these are questions showing a desire to expound.
 Herein, since those who know, those who do not know, those outside the
 Dispensation, those within it, those who speak by hearsay, etc., and those
 who speak by personal knowledge, say "one of right view," therefore, taking
 it as an expression (common) to the many, he touched upon it twice, saying
 "One of right view, one of right view" is said, friends (sammaditthi sammaditth
i ti avuso vuccati).
 The intention here is this: "Others say 'one of right view,' and still
 others say 'one of right view.' Since that is said, in what way, friends,
 is a noble disciple one of right view in respect of meaning and characteristic?
" Herein, one of right view is one possessing a lucid and praiseworthy view
 (sobhanaya pasatthaya ca ditthiya samannagato).
 But when this word "right view" is used to signify a state (rather than
 a person endowed with that state), it then means a lucid and praiseworthy
 view.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This right view is twofold: mundane (lokiya) and supramundane (lokuttara).
 Herein, the knowledge of kamma as one's own and knowledge which is in conformit
y with the (Four Noble) Truths are mundane right view; or, in brief, (mundane
 right view is) all understanding that is accompanied by the taints.2 Understandi
ng connected with the noble paths and fruits is supramundane right view.3
 The person possessing right view is of three kinds: the worldling (puthujjana),
 the disciple in higher training (sekha), and the one beyond training (asekha).
 Herein, the worldling is of two kinds: one outside the Dispensation and
 one within the Dispensation.
 Herein, one outside the Dispensation who believes in kamma is one of right
 view on account of the view of kamma as one's own, but not on account of
 that which is in conformity with the truths, because he holds to the view
 of self.
 One within the Dispensation is of right view on account of both.
 The disciple in higher training is one of right view on account of fixed
 right view,4 the one beyond training on account of (the right view) that
 is beyond training.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But here "one of right view" is intended as one possessing supramundane
 wholesome right view, which is fixed in destiny and emancipating.
 Hence he said: whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the
 Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma (ujugata'ssa ditthi dhamme
 aveccappasadena samannagato agato imam saddhammam).
 Because of its going straight without deviating to either extreme, or because
 of its going straight by removing all crookedness such as bodily crookedness,
 etc., supramundane right view is "straight." One possessing that view also
 possesses perfect confidence, unshakable confidence, in the ninefold supramunda
ne Dhamma.6 And by becoming disentangled from all the thickets of (wrong)
 views, by abandoning all the defilements, by departing from the round of
 rebirths, by bringing the practice to its consummation, he is said to have
 come by the noble path to this "true Dhamma" proclaimed by the Enlightened
 One, that is, Nibbana, the plunge into the Deathless.

 Understands the unwholesome (akusalan ca pajanati): he understands the
 unwholesome called the ten courses of unwholesome kamma (action), penetrating
 this by way of function with the understanding that has Nibbana as its
 object as "This is suffering." (Understands) the root of the unwholesome
 (akusalamulan ca pajanati): And he understands the unwholesome root which
 has become the root condition of that (unwholesome), penetrating this,
 in the same way, as "This is the origin of suffering." The same method applies
 here also in regard to "the wholesome" and "the root of the wholesome."
 And, as it is here, so in all the following sections, the understanding
 of the subject should be understood by way of function.

 and has arrived at this true Dhamma: At this point the summary version

 And this (part of) the teaching itself was brief; but for those bhikkhus
 it should be understood that the penetration (of the meaning) through right
 attention occurred in detail.

 that begins "he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust." But
 the Elder (presiding over the council) said: "In the brief exposition the

\begin_layout Standard
The Unwholesome Courses of Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Herein, firstly, in the detailed exposition of the first section: as regards
 the passage beginning killing living beings is unwholesome (panatipato
 kho avuso akusalam), "unwholesome" should be understood by way of the occurrenc
e of unwholesomeness, or as what is opposed to the wholesome, which is to
 be dealt with below (Section 6).
 As to characteristic, it is blameworthy and has painful result, or it is
 defiled.
 This, in the first place, is the comment upon the general terms here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as regards the particular terms, the phrase killing living beings means
 the slaughter of a living being, the destruction of a living being.
 And here a living being (pana) is, according to ordinary usage, a being
 (satta); in the ultimate sense it is the life faculty.
 "Killing living beings" is the volition to kill on the part of one who
 is aware, in respect of a living being, that it is a living being, and
 which (volition), manifesting itself through one or the other of the doors
 of body and speech, initiates activity resulting in the cutting off of
 the life faculty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In relation to beings such as animals, etc., which lack moral qualities (guna),
 it is less blameworthy in respect of small living beings and more blameworthy
 in respect of beings with large bodies.
 Why? Because of the magnitude of the effort involved.
 And when the effort involved is equal, because of the magnitude of the
 object (the being killed).
 In relation to beings such as humans, etc., who possess moral qualities,
 it is less blameworthy in respect of beings with few good qualities and
 more blameworthy in respect of beings with great qualities.
 When the size of the body and moral qualities are equal, however, it is
 less blameworthy when the defilements and activity are mild, and more blamewort
hy when they are strong: so it should be understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are five constituents for this (act of killing a living being): a
 living being, awareness that it is a living being, the mind to kill, activity,
 and the death (of the being) thereby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six means: one's own person, command, a missile, a fixed contrivance,
 a magical spell, supernormal power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore this matter in detail, however, would involve too much diffuseness.
 Therefore we shall not explore it in detail, or any other subject similar
 in kind.
 Those who wish to go into the matter may do so by looking it up in the
 Samantapasadika, the Vinaya Commentary.8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking what is not given (adinnadana): the carrying off of others' goods,
 stealing, robbery, is what is meant.
 Herein, "what is not given" is another's possession, which the other may
 use as he likes without incurring penalty or blame.
 "Taking what is not given" is the volition to steal on the part of one
 who is aware, in respect of another's possession, that it is another's
 possession, and which (volition) initiates activity resulting in the taking
 of that thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That (taking of what is not given) is less blameworthy when the other's
 property is of low value, and more blameworthy when it is of high value.
 Why? Because of the high value of the object (stolen).
 When the value of the objects is equal, the act is more blameworthy when
 the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities, and less blameworthy
 when the object belongs to one who, in comparison, is inferior with respect
 to moral qualities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are five constituents of this act: another's possession, awareness
 that it is another's possession, the mind to steal, the activity, and the
 carrying off (of the object) thereby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six means: one's own person, etc.
 (as for killing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And these (acts of stealing) may be classed, according to the way in which
 they occur, by way of the following: taking by theft, by force, by concealment,
 by stratagem, by fraud.
 This here is in brief; the details, however, are given in the Samantapasadika.9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Misconduct in sensual pleasures (kamesu micchacara): here, "in sensual pleasures
" (kamesu) means in regard to sexual intercourse.
 "Misconduct" is entirely reprehensible vile conduct.
 As to characteristic, sexual misconduct is the volition to transgress bounds
 occurring through the body door by way of unrighteous intent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein, out of bounds for men, firstly, are the twenty kinds of women, that
 is, the ten beginning with those protected by the mother, namely, "protected
 by the mother, protected by the father, protected by the mother and father,
 protected by the brother, protected by the sister, protected by relatives,
 protected by the clan, protected by the law, under protection, entailing
 a penalty"; and the ten beginning with those purchased with money, namely,
 "one purchased with money, one who lives (with a man) by her own desire,
 one who lives (with a man) on account of wealth, one who lives (with a
 man) on account of cloth, one who is given (in marriage with the ceremony
 of) dipping the hand in water, one who has been (taken to wife and) relieved
 of her burden-carrying head-pad, one who is a slave and a wife, one who
 is a servant and a wife, one who is carried off in a raid, one engaged
 at so much a time."10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, as concerns women, for the twelve kinds of women consisting of the
 two, namely, under protection and entailing a penalty, and the ten beginning
 with those purchased with money, other men are out of bounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sexual misconduct is less blameworthy when (the person) out of bounds
 is without good qualities such as virtue, etc., and more blameworthy when
 (the person) possesses good qualities such as virtue, etc.
 There are four constituents of this act: an object which is out of bounds,
 the mind to engage in that, the effort to engage, and consent to the union
 of sexual organs.11 The means is single: one's own person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
False speech (musavada): "false" (musa) is the verbal effort or bodily effort
 for destroying welfare (made) by one bent on deceiving.
 "False speech" is the volition initiating the verbal effort or bodily effort
 of deceiving another on the part of one intent on deceiving.
 According to another method, "false" means an unreal, untrue case, "speech"
 the communication of that as being real, true.
 As to characteristic, "false speech" is the volition of one desiring to
 communicate to another an untrue case as being true, which (volition) initiates
 such an act of communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight, and more
 blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is great.
 Further, when it occurs on the part of householders who, not wishing to
 give away some belonging of theirs, say "I do not have it," it is less
 blameworthy; when one who is a witness speaks (falsely) for the purpose
 of destroying another's welfare, it is more blameworthy.
 In the case of those gone forth, when it occurs by their saying as a joke,
 after they have obtained just a little oil or ghee, in the manner of the
 Puranas, "Today the oil is flowing in the village just like a river," then
 it is less blameworthy; but for those who speak (as a witness) saying that
 they have seen what they have not seen it is more blameworthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four constituents of this act: an untrue case, the mind to deceive,
 the appropriate effort, the communicating of that meaning to another.
 The means is single: one's own person only.
 That is to be regarded as the performing of the action of deceiving another
 by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body or by
 means of speech.
 If, through that action, the other understands that meaning, one is bound
 by the kamma of false speech at the very moment of the volition initiating
 the action.

Malicious speech, etc.: The kind of speech that creates in the heart of the
 person to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness (of affection)

 kind of speech which is also itself harsh, being pleasant neither to the
 ear nor to the heart — that is harsh speech (pharusa vaca).
 That by which one gossips idly, without meaning, is gossip (samphappalapa).
 Also, the volition that is the root cause of these gains the name "malicious
 speech," etc.
 And that only is intended here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein, malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind, which
 (volition) initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division
 among others or to endear oneself (to another).
 It is less blameworthy when the person divided has few good qualities,
 and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.
 Its constituents are four: another person to be divided, the intention
 to divide, (thinking) "Thus these will be separated and split" or the desire
 to endear oneself, (thinking) "Thus I shall become loved and intimate,"
 the appropriate effort, the communicating of that meaning to that person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harsh speech is the entirely harsh volition initiating an effort by body
 or by speech to wound another's vital feelings.
 This is an example given for the purpose of making it clear: A village
 boy, it is said, went to the forest without heeding his mother's words.
 Unable to make him turn back, she scolded him angrily, saying: "May a wild
 buffalo chase you!" Then a buffalo appeared before him right there in the
 forest.
 The boy made an asseveration of truth, saying: "Let it not be as my mother
 said but as she thought!" The buffalo stood as though tied there.
 Thus, although the means (employed) was that of wounding the vital feelings,
 because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speech.
 For sometimes parents even say to their children, "May robbers chop you
 to pieces!" yet they do not even wish a lotus leaf to fall upon them.
 And teachers and preceptors sometimes say to their pupils, "What is the
 use of these shameless and heedless brats? Drive them out!" yet they wish
 for their success in learning and attainment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as, through gentleness of mind, speech is not harsh, so through gentleness
 of speech, speech does not become unharsh; for the words "Let him sleep
 in peace" spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh speech.
 But harsh speech is such on account of harshness of mind only.
 It is less blameworthy when the person to whom it is spoken has few good
 qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.
 Its constituents are three: another to be abused, an angry mind, the abusing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gossip is the unwholesome volition initiating an effort by body or by speech
 to communicate what is purposeless.
 It is less blameworthy when indulged in mildly, and more blameworthy when
 indulged in strongly.
 Its constituents are two: the being intent on purposeless stories such
 as the Bharata war or the abduction of Sita, etc., and the telling of such
 stories.12
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Covetousness (abhijjha): It covets, thus it is covetousness; "having become
 directed towards others' goods, it occurs through inclination towards them"
 is the meaning.
 It has the characteristic of coveting others' goods thus: "Oh, that this
 were mine!" It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case
 of taking what is not given.
 Its constituents are two: another's goods, and the inclination for them
 to be one's own.
 For even though greed has arisen based on another's goods, it is not classed
 as a (completed) course of kamma so long as one does not incline to them
 as one's own (with the thought), "Oh, that this were mine!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ill will (byapada): It injures welfare and happiness, thus it is ill will
 (hitasukham byapadayati ti byapado).
 Its characteristic is the mental defect (of wishing for) the destruction
 of others.
 It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of harsh speech.
 Its constituents are two: another being, and the wish for that being's
 destruction.
 For even though anger has arisen based on another being, there is no breach
 of a course of kamma so long as one does not wish, "Oh, that this being
 might be cut off and destroyed!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wrong view (micchaditthi): It sees wrongly due to the absence of a correct
 grasp of things, thus it is wrong view.
 Its characteristic is the mistaken view that "there is no (result from)
 giving," etc.
 It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of gossip.
 Moreover, it is less blameworthy when not fixed in destiny, and more blameworth
y when fixed.13 Its constituents are two: a mistaken manner of grasping the
 basis (for the view), and the appearance of that (basis) in accordance
 with the manner in which it has been grasped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the exposition of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma should be understoo
d in five ways: as to mental state (dhammato), as to category (kotthasato),
 as to object (arammanato), as to feeling (vedanato), and as to root (mulato).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein, as to mental state: The first seven among these are volitional states
 only.
 The three beginning with covetousness are associated with volition.14
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to category: The eight consisting of the first seven and wrong view are
 courses of kamma only, not roots.
 Covetousness and ill will are courses of kamma and also roots; for covetousness
, having arrived at the (state of) a root, is the unwholesome root greed,
 and ill will is the unwholesome root hate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to object: Killing living beings, because it has the life faculty as
 object, has a formation as object.
 Taking what is not given has beings as object or formations as object.
 Misconduct in sensual pleasures has formations as object by way of tangible
 object; but some say it also has beings as object.
 False speech has beings or formations as object; likewise malicious speech.
 Harsh speech has only beings as object.
 Gossip has either beings or formations as object by way of the seen, heard,
 sensed and cognized; likewise covetousness.
 Ill will has only beings as object.
 Wrong view has formations as object by way of the states belonging to the
 three planes (of being).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to feeling: Killing living beings has painful feeling; for although kings,
 seeing a robber, say laughingly, "Go and execute him," their volition consummat
ing the action is associated only with pain.
 Taking what is not given has three feelings.
 Misconduct (in sensual pleasures) has two feelings, pleasant and neutral,
 but in the mind which consummates the action there is no neutral feeling.
 False speech has three feelings; likewise malicious speech.
 Harsh speech has painful feeling only.
 Gossip has three feelings.
 Covetousness has two feelings, pleasant and neutral; likewise wrong view.
 Ill will has painful feeling only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to root: Killing living beings has two roots, by way of hate and delusion;
 taking what is not given, by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed
 and delusion; misconduct, by way of greed and delusion; false speech, by
 way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion; likewise for
 malicious speech and gossip; harsh speech, by way of hate and delusion.
 Covetousness has one root, by way of delusion; likewise ill will.
 Wrong view has two roots, by way of greed and delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Unwholesome Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Greed is a root of the unwholesome, etc.: It is greedy, thus it is greed
 (lubbhati ti lobho); it offends against (it hates), thus it is hate (dussati
 ti doso); it deludes, thus it is delusion (muyhati ti moho).
 Among these, greed is itself unwholesome in the sense that it is blameworthy
 and has painful results; and it is a root of these unwholesome (deeds)
 beginning with killing living beings, for some in the sense that it is
 an associated originative cause, for some in the sense that it is a decisive
 support condition.
 Thus it is an unwholesome root.
 This too is said: "One who is lustful, friends, overwhelmed and with mind
 obsessed by lust, kills a living being" (A.3:71/i,216; text slightly different).
 The same method applies to the state of being unwholesome roots in the
 cases of hate and delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Wholesome Courses of Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Abstention from killing living beings is wholesome (panatipata veramani),
 etc.: Here "killing living beings," etc.
 have the same meaning as aforesaid.
 It crushes the hostile, thus it is abstention (veram manati ti veramani);
 the meaning is that it abandons the hostile.
 Or: with that as the instrument one abstains (viramati), the syllable ve
 being substituted for the syllable vi.
 This here is, in the first place, the commentary on the phrasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as to the meaning, abstention is refraining (virati) associated with
 wholesome consciousness.
 What is stated thus: "For one refraining from killing living beings, that
 which is on that occasion the leaving off, the refraining" (Vibh.
 285), that is the refraining associated with wholesome consciousness.
 As to kind, it is threefold: refraining in the presence of opportunity,
 refraining because of an undertaking, and refraining because of eradication
 (of defilements).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein, refraining in the presence of an opportunity (sampattavirati) is
 to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those who have not undertake
n any training rule but who do not transgress when an opportunity for doing
 so presents itself because they reflect upon their birth, age, learning,
 etc., like the lay follower Cakkana in the island of Sri Lanka.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he was a boy, it is said, his mother developed an illness, and the
 doctor said, "Fresh hare's flesh is needed." Then Cakkana's brother sent
 him, saying, "Go, dear, and hunt in the field." He went there.
 On that occasion a hare had come to eat the young corn.
 On seeing him it bolted swiftly, but it got entangled in a creeper and
 squealed "kiri, kiri." Guided by the sound, Cakkana went and caught it,
 thinking, "I will make medicine for my mother." Then he thought again, "This
 is not proper for me, that I should deprive another of life for the sake
 of my mother's life." So he released it, saying "Go and enjoy the grass
 and the water with the other hares in the forest." When his brother asked
 him, "Did you get a hare, dear?" he told him what had happened.
 His brother scolded him.
 He went to his mother and determined upon an asseveration of truth: "Since
 I was born I am not aware that I have ever intentionally deprived a living
 being of life." Straightaway his mother became well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Refraining because of an undertaking (samadanavirati) is to be understood
 as the refraining which occurs in those who do not transgress in a particular
 case because they have undertaken training rules, giving up even their
 own lives in the undertaking of the training rules and in what is superior
 to that, like the lay follower who dwelt at Uttaravaddhamana Mountain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is said that after undertaking the training rules from the Elder Pingala
 Buddharakkhita who lived in the Ambariya Monastery, he was plowing a field.
 Then his ox got lost.
 Searching for it, he climbed up Uttaravaddhamana Mountain.
 There a large serpent seized him.
 He thought, "Let me cut off his head with this sharp axe." Then he thought
 again, "This is not proper for me, that I should break a training rule
 that I have undertaken in the presence of my honored teacher." Thinking
 up to the third time, "I will give up my life but not the training rule,"
 he threw the sharp hand axe that was slung on his shoulder into the forest.
 Straightaway the creature released him and went away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Refraining because of eradication (of defilements) (samucchedavirati) is
 to be understood as the refraining associated with the noble path.
 After the arising of this even the thought, "I will kill a living being,"
 does not occur to the noble persons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This refraining is called "wholesome" (kusala) because of the occurrence
 of wholesomeness (kosalla); or because of shedding the vile (kucchitassa
 salanato).
 Also, evil conduct is commonly called "weeds" (kusa) and it mows this down
 (lunati), thus it is called "wholesome."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the case of the unwholesome, so for these courses of wholesome kamma
 the exposition should be understood in five ways: as to mental state, as
 to category, as to object, as to feeling, and as to root.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein, as to mental state: The first seven among these can be both volitions
 and abstinences; the last three are associated with volition only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to category: The first seven are courses of kamma only, not roots.
 The last three are courses of kamma and also roots.
 For non-covetousness, having arrived at the (state of) a root, is the wholesome
 root non-greed; non-ill will is the wholesome root non-hate; and right
 view is the wholesome root non-delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to object: The objects of these are the same as the objects of killing
 living beings, etc.
 For abstention is spoken of in relation to something which can be transgressed.
 But just as the noble path, which has Nibbana as object, abandons the defilemen
ts, so too should these courses of kamma, which have the life faculty, etc.,
 as object, be understood to abandon the kinds of evil conduct beginning
 with killing living beings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to feeling: All have pleasant feeling or neutral feeling.
 For there is no painful feeling which arrives at the wholesome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to root: The first seven courses of kamma have three roots by way of
 non-greed, non-hate, and non-delusion in one who abstains by means of conscious
ness associated with knowledge.
 They have two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness dissociated
 from knowledge.15 Non-covetousness has two roots in one who abstains by
 means of consciousness associated with knowledge, one root (in one who
 abstains) by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge.
 Non-greed, however, is not by itself its own root.
 The same method applies in the case of non-ill will.
 Right view always has two roots, by way of non-greed and non-hate.16
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Wholesome Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Non-greed is a root of the wholesome (alobho kusalamulam), etc.: Non-greed
 is not greed; this is a term for the state that is opposed to greed.
 The same method applies in the case of non-hate and non-delusion.
 Among these, non-greed is itself wholesome; and it is a root of these wholesome
 (courses of kamma) beginning with abstention from killing living beings,
 for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause and for
 some in the sense that it is a decisive support condition.
 Thus it is a wholesome root.
 The same method applies to the state of being wholesome roots in the cases
 of non-hate and non-delusion.

Conclusion on the Unwholesome and the Wholesome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 Now, summing up the meaning of all that has been set forth in brief and
 in detail, he states the concluding section beginning with the words when
 a noble disciple.
 Herein, has thus understood the wholesome (evam akusalam pajanati) means:
 has thus understood the unwholesome by way of the ten courses of unwholesome
 kamma as described.
 The same method applies in the case of the root of the unwholesome, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up to this point, by a single method, emancipation as far as arahantship
 has been expounded for one who has the Four Noble Truths as his meditation
 subject.
 How? Here, the ten courses of unwholesome kamma with the exception of covetousn
ess, and the (ten) courses of wholesome kamma, are the truth of suffering.
 These two states — covetousness and the greed which is a root of the unwholesom
e — are, literally speaking, the truth of the origin.
 Speaking figuratively, however, all the courses of kamma are the truth
 of suffering, and all the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth
 of the origin.17 The non-occurrence of both is the truth of cessation.
 The noble path fully understanding suffering, abandoning its origin, and
 understanding its cessation is the truth of the path.
 Thus two truths are stated in their own nature and two are to be understood
 by way of the guideline of conversion.18
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust (so sabbaso raganusayam
 pahaya): Understanding thus the unwholesome, etc., he abandons in all ways
 the underlying tendency to lust.
 He abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion (patighanusayam pativinodetva)
: and he removes in all ways too the underlying tendency to aversion, is
 what is meant.
 Up to this point the path of non-return is stated.19 He extirpates the underlyin
g tendency to the view and conceit "I am" (asmi ti ditthimananusayam samuhanitva
): he extricates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit which occurs
 in the mode of grasping the five aggregates as a group (with the notion)
 "I am," due to failure to distinguish any state among them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein, by the phrase the underlying tendency to the view and conceit "I
 am" (ditthimananusayam) what is meant is the underlying tendency to conceit
 which is similar to a view (ditthisadisam mananusayam).
 For this underlying tendency to conceit is similar to a view because it
 occurs (with the notion) "I am"; therefore it is stated thus.
 And one who wishes to understand this conceit "I am" in detail should look
 up the Khemaka Sutta in the Khandhiyavagga (S.22:89/iii,126ff.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By abandoning ignorance (avijjam pahaya): having abandoned ignorance, the
 root of the round (of existence).
 And arousing true knowledge (vijjam uppadetva): having aroused the true
 knowledge of the path of arahantship which completely extricates that ignorance.
 At this point the path of arahantship is stated.20 He here and now makes
 an end of suffering (ditth'eva dhamme dukkhass'antakaro hoti): in this
 very existence he becomes one who cuts off the suffering of the round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that way too (ettavatapi kho avuso): he marks off (this first part of)
 the teaching; by way of the attention and penetration stated in this exposition
 of the courses of kamma, is what is meant.
 The rest is as aforesaid.
 Thus he concludes the exposition by means of the path of non-return and
 the path of arahantship.

The Four Nutriments: General

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 Saying, "Good, friend,"...
 (etc.)..." and has arrived at this true Dhamma": Thus, having heard the Venerable
 Sariputta's exposition of the four truths under the heading of the wholesome
 and the unwholesome, the bhikkhus delighted in his words with the statement,
 "Good, friend," and rejoiced with the mind that aroused that statement;
 what is meant is that they agreed by word and approved by mind.
 Now, because the Elder was competent to give an exposition on the four
 truths in diverse ways — as (the Blessed One) said: "Bhikkhus, Sariputta
 is able to propound, to teach, the Four Noble Truths in detail" (M.141/iii,
 248); or because he had said "in that way too," being desirous of giving
 a further exposition, the bhikkhus, being desirous of hearing the teaching
 of the four truths by another method, asked him a further question.
 By asking "But, friend, might there be another way? Would there be another
 case?" they asked another question additional to that question asked and
 answered (already) by the Venerable Sariputta himself.
 Or what is meant is that they asked a question subsequent to the previous
 one.
 Then, answering them, the Elder said, "There might be, friends," and so
 on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
10.
 Herein, this is the elucidation of the terms that are not clear.
 Nutriment (ahara) is a condition (paccaya).
 For a condition nourishes its own fruit, therefore it is called nutriment.21
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
11.
 Of beings that already have come to be (bhutanam va sattanam), etc.: Here
 come to be (bhuta) means come to birth, reborn; seeking a new existence
 (sambhavesinam) means those who seek, search for, existence, birth, production.
 Therein, among the four kinds of generation,22 beings born from eggs and
 from the womb are said to be "seeking a new existence" as long as they
 have not broken out of the eggshell or the placenta.
 When they have broken out of the eggshell or the placenta and emerged outside,
 they are said to have "come to be." The moisture-born and the spontaneously
 born are said to be "seeking a new existence" at the first moment of consciousn
ess; from the second moment of consciousness onwards they are said to have
 "come to be."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or alternatively, "come to be" is born, reproduced; this is a term for those
 who have destroyed the cankers (arahants), who are reckoned thus: "They
 have come to be only, but they will not come to be again." "Seeking a new
 existence" means they seek a new existence; this is a term for worldlings
 and disciples in higher training who seek a new existence in the future
 too, because they have not abandoned the fetter of being.
 Thus by these two terms he includes all beings in all ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the maintenance (thitiya); for the purpose of maintaining.
 For the support (anuggahaya): for the purpose of supporting, for the purpose
 of helping.
 This is merely a difference of words, but the meaning of the two terms
 is one only.
 Or alternatively, "for the maintenance" is for the non-interruption of
 this or that being by means of the serial connection of arisen states.
 "For the support" is for the arising of unarisen (states).
 And both these expressions should be regarded as applicable in both cases
 thus: "For the maintenance and support of those that have come to be, and
 for the maintenance and support of those seeking a new existence."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Four Kinds of Nutriment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Physical food as nutriment (lit.
 "food made into a ball") (kabalinkaro aharo) is nutriment that can be swallowed
 after making it into a ball; this is a term for the nutritive essence which
 has as its basis boiled rice, junket, etc.23 Gross or subtle (olariko va
 sukhumo va): it is gross because of the grossness of the basis, and subtle
 because of the subtlety of the basis.
 But because physical nutriment is included in subtle materiality, by way
 of its individual essence it is subtle only.24 And also that grossness and
 subtlety should be understood relatively in respect of the basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nutriment of peacocks is subtle compared with the nutriment of crocodiles.
 Crocodiles, they say, swallow stones, and these dissolve on reaching their
 stomachs.
 Peacocks eat such animals as snakes, scorpions, etc.
 But the nutriment of hyenas is subtle compared with the nutriment of peacocks.
 These, they say, eat horns and bones thrown away three years before, and
 these become soft as yams as soon as they are moistened with their saliva.
 Also, the nutriment of elephants is subtle compared with the nutriment
 of hyenas.
 For these eat the branches of various trees, etc.
 The nutriment of the gayal buffalo, the antelope, the deer, etc., is subtler
 than the nutriment of elephants.
 These, they say, eat the sapless leaves of various kinds of trees, etc.
 The nutriment of cows is subtler than their nutriment; they eat fresh and
 dried grass.
 The nutriment of hares is subtler than their nutriment; that of birds is
 subtler than that of hares; that of barbarians is subtler than that of
 birds; that of village headmen is subtler than that of barbarians; that
 of kings and kings' ministers is subtler than village headmens'; that of
 a Wheel-turning Monarch is subtler than their nutriment.
 The earth deities' nutriment is subtler than that of a Wheel-turning Monarch.
 The nutriment of the deities of the Four Great Kings is subtler than that
 of the earth deities.
 Thus nutriment should be elaborated up to that of the deities who wield
 power over others' creations.25 But saying, "Their nutriment is subtle,"
 the end is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And here, in a basis that is gross, the nutritive essence is limited and
 weak; in one that is subtle, it is strong.
 Thus one who has drunk even a full bowl of gruel is soon hungry again and
 desirous of eating anything; but after drinking even a small amount of
 ghee, he will not want to eat for the whole day.
 Therein, it is the basis that dispels fatigue, but it is unable to preserve;
 but the nutritive essence preserves, though it cannot dispel fatigue.
 But when the two are combined they both dispel fatigue and preserve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contact as the second (phasso dutiyo): The sixfold contact beginning with
 eye-contact should be understood as the second of these four kinds of nutriment.
 And this is the method of the teaching itself; therefore it should not
 be inquired into here, saying "For this reason it is the second, or the
 third." Mental volition (manosancetana): volition (cetana) itself is stated.
 Consciousness (viññanam): any kind of consciousness whatever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be asked here: "If the meaning of condition is the meaning of nutriment,
 then, when other conditions also exist for beings, why are only these four
 stated?" It should be said in reply: "It is because they are the special
 conditions for personal continuity." For physical nutriment is the special
 condition for the material body of beings that eat physical nutriment;
 as regards the group of mental constituents, contact is (the special condition)
 for feeling, mental volition for consciousness, and consciousness for mentality
-materiality.
 As it is said: "Just as, bhikkhus, this body has nutriment for its maintenance,
 is maintained in dependence on nutriment, and without nutriment is not
 maintained" (S.46:2/v,64); and likewise: "With contact as condition, feeling;...
 with formations as condition, consciousness;...
 with consciousness as condition, mentality-materiality" (S.12:1/ii,1, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is this nutriment, and what does it nourish? Physical nutriment nourishes
 the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth;26 contact as nutriment
 nourishes the three feelings; mental volition as nutriment nourishes the
 three kinds of being; consciousness as nutriment nourishes the mentality-materi
ality of rebirth-linking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How? As soon as it is placed in the mouth, physical food as nutriment brings
 into being the eight kinds of materiality (aforesaid).
 Then each lump of cooked rice ground by the teeth, on being swallowed,
 brings into being unit after unit of the eight kinds of materiality.
 Thus it nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But with contact as nutriment, when contact productive of pleasant feeling
 arises it nourishes pleasant feeling; contact productive of painful feeling
 nourishes painful feeling; contact productive of neither-painful-nor-pleasant
 feeling nourishes neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.
 Thus in all ways contact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of mental volition as nutriment, kamma leading to sense-sphere
 being nourishes sense-sphere being; kamma leading to fine-material and
 immaterial being nourishes its respective kind of being.
 Thus in all ways mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds
 of being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But with consciousness as nutriment, it is said that it nourishes, by way
 of conascence condition, etc., the three (immaterial) aggregates associated
 with itself at the moment of rebirth-linking and the thirty kinds of materialit
y that arise by way of triple continuity.
 Thus consciousness nourishes the mentality-materiality of rebirth-linking.27
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And here, by the words "mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three
 kinds of being," only the wholesome and unwholesome volition accompanied
 by taints is meant; by the words "consciousness nourishes the mentality-materia
lity of rebirth-linking," only rebirth-linking consciousness is meant.
 However, these are to be understood indiscriminately as nutriments as well
 because they nourish the states that are associated with them and originated
 by them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Four Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As regards these four kinds of nutriment, physical food as nutriment accomplishe
s the function of nutriment by sustaining, contact by contacting (touching),
 mental volition by accumulating, consciousness by cognizing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How? Physical food as nutriment, by sustaining, is for the maintenance of
 beings by maintaining the body.
 For this body, though generated by kamma, is sustained by physical food
 and stands for ten years or a hundred years up to the end of the life-span.
 Like what? Like a child which, though given birth by the mother, is nurtured
 by the milk, etc., given to him to drink by the wet-nurse and thus lives
 long.
 Also, as a house is supported by a prop.
 This too has been said (untraced): "Great king, just as, when a house is
 collapsing, they prop it up with other timber, and that house, being propped
 up by other timber, does not collapse, so too this body is supported by
 nutriment, persists in dependence upon nutriment."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by
 sustaining.
 Accomplishing it thus, physical food as nutriment becomes a condition for
 two material continuities, namely, for that originated by nutriment and
 that kammically acquired.28 It is a condition for the kamma-born materiality
 by becoming its preserver.
 It is a condition for that originated by nutriment by becoming its producer.

\begin_layout Standard
Then contact, by contacting the object which is the basis for pleasure,
 etc., is "for the maintenance of beings" by causing the occurrence of pleasant
 feeling, etc.
 Mental volition, accumulating by way of wholesome and unwholesome kamma,
 is "for the maintenance of beings" because it provides the root of existence.
 Consciousness, by cognizing, is "for the maintenance of beings" by causing
 the occurrence of mentality-materiality.

\begin_layout Standard
The Four Dangers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, while these are accomplishing their function of nutriment by sustaining,
 etc., four dangers are to be seen: the danger of desire in the case of physical
 food as nutriment; the danger of approach in the case of contact; (the
 danger) of accumulating in the case of mental volition; and (the danger)
 of launching [into a new existence here or there by way of taking rebirth-linki
ng] in the case of consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are the reasons (for this)? Because, having aroused desire for physical
 food, beings face cold, etc., to undertake such work as checking, accounting,
 etc., and incur not a little suffering.
 And some who have gone forth in this dispensation seek nutriment through
 such improper means as the practice of medicine, etc., and they are to be
 censured here and now, and hereafter they become "recluse ghosts" in the
 manner described thus in the Lakkhana Samyutta: "And his outer robe was
 burning, blazing," etc.29 For this reason, desire itself is to be understood
 as the danger in physical food as nutriment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who approach contact, who find gratification in contact, commit crimes
 in respect of others' guarded and protected belongings, such as their wives,
 etc.
 When the owners of the goods catch them with their belongings, they cut
 them into pieces or throw them onto a rubbish heap, or hand them over to
 the king; and then the king has various tortures inflicted upon them.
 And with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination is to
 be expected for them.
 Thus this entire danger — that pertaining to the here and now and that
 pertaining to the afterlife — has come about rooted in contact.
 For this reason, approach is to be understood as the danger in the case
 of the nutriment contact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The entire danger in the three realms of existence has come about by the
 accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome kamma and is rooted in that (accumula
tion).
 For this reason, accumulation is to be understood as the danger in the
 nutriment mental volition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in whatever place rebirth-linking consciousness launches (the new existence)
, in that same place it is reborn by seizing the rebirth-linking mentality-mater
iality.
 When it is produced, all dangers are produced, for they are all rooted
 in it.
 For this reason, launching is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment
 consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Four Similes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In regard to these nutriments with their dangers, for the sake of eliminating
 desire for the nutriment physical food, the Fully Enlightened One taught
 the simile of son's flesh in the passage beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus,
 a couple, a man and his wife,..." For the sake of eliminating desire for the
 nutriment contact, he taught the simile of the flayed cow in the passage
 beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a flayed cow..." For the sake
 of eliminating desire for the nutriment mental volition, he taught the
 simile of the charcoal pit in the passage beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus,
 there was a charcoal pit..." And for the sake of eliminating desire for the
 nutriment consciousness, he taught the simile of the man struck with three
 hundred spears in the passage beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus, there
 was a thief, a crook..."30
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein, taking the essential meaning, there follows a brief interpretation
 of the meaning.
 A couple, it is said, a man and his wife, took their son and set out on
 a desert trail a hundred yojanas long,31 with only limited provisions.
 When they had gone fifty yojanas their provisions ran out.
 Exhausted by hunger and thirst, they sat down in some scanty shade.
 Then the man said to his wife: "My dear, for fifty yojanas on all sides
 there is neither a village nor a town.
 Therefore, though a man can do many kinds of work, such as plowing, guarding
 cattle, etc., it is not possible for me to do that.
 Come, kill me.
 Eat half of my flesh, and having made the other half into provisions for
 the journey, cross out of the desert together with our son."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wife said: "Dear husband, though a woman can do many kinds of work,
 such as spinning thread, etc., it is not possible for me to do that.
 Come, kill me.
 Eat half of my flesh, and having made the other half into provisions for
 the journey, cross out of the desert together with our son."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the man said: "My dear, the death of the mother would mean the death
 of two, for a young boy cannot live without his mother.
 But if we both live, then we can beget another child again.
 Come now, let us kill our child, take his flesh, and cross out of this
 desert."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the mother said to the son: "Dear, go to your father." He went, but
 the father said: "For the sake of supporting this child I incurred much
 suffering through such work as plowing, guarding cattle, etc.
 I cannot kill the boy.
 You kill your son." Then he said: "Dear, go to your mother." But the mother
 said: "Longing for a son I incurred much suffering by observing the cow-observa
nce, the dog-observance, praying to the gods, etc., not to speak of bearing
 him in my womb.32 It is not possible for me to kill him." Then she said:
 "Dear, go to your father."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy died from going back and forth between the father and the mother.
 Seeing him dead, they wept, and having taken the flesh as described above,
 they departed.
 Because that flesh of their son was repulsive to them for nine reasons,
 it was not eaten for enjoyment nor for intoxication nor for making (the
 body) strong and beautiful, but only for the purpose of crossing out of
 the desert.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For what nine reasons was it repulsive? Because it was the flesh of their
 own offspring, the flesh of a relative, the flesh of a son, the flesh of
 a dear son, the flesh of a youngster, raw flesh, not beef, unsalted, unspiced.
 Therefore the bhikkhu who sees the nutriment physical food thus, as similar
 to son's flesh, eliminates the desire for it.33
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, in the first place, is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile
 of son's flesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, as regards the simile of the flayed cow: If a cow were stripped of
 its skin from the neck to the hooves and then set free, whatever it would
 rest upon would become a basis of pain for it, since it would be bitten
 by the small creatures living there.34 So too, whatever physical basis or
 object contact stands upon as its support becomes a basis for the felt
 pain originating from that basis or object.35 Therefore a bhikkhu who sees
 the nutriment contact thus, as similar to a flayed cow, eliminates the
 desire for it.
 This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the flayed cow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, as regards the simile of the charcoal pit:36 The three realms of being
 are like a charcoal pit in the sense of a great burning heat (lit., a great
 fever).
 Like the two men who grab hold (of a weaker man) by both his arms and drag
 him towards it, is mental volition in the sense that it drags one towards
 the realms of being.
 Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment mental volition thus, as similar
 to a charcoal pit, eliminates the desire for it.
 This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the charcoal
 pit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, as regards the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears:37
 The hundred spears that strike the man in the morning make a hundred wound
 openings in his body, and without remaining inside they pierce through
 and fall on the other side; and so with the other two hundred spears as
 well.
 Thus his whole body is cut again and again by the spears which come without
 piercing him in a place where another has already struck.
 There is no measuring the pain arisen in him from even one of the wound
 openings, not to speak of three hundred wound openings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein, the time of the generation of the rebirth-linking consciousness
 is like the time of being struck by a spear.
 The production of the aggregates is like the production of the wound openings.
 The arising of the various kinds of suffering rooted in the round (of existence
) once the aggregates have been born is like the arising of suffering on
 account of the wound openings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another method of interpretation (is as follows): The rebirth-linking consciousn
ess is like the thief.
 His mentality-materiality conditioned by consciousness is like the wound
 openings created by the striking of the spears.
 The arising of the various kinds of suffering by way of the thirty-two
 types of torture and the eighty-nine types of diseases in regard to consciousne
ss conditioned by mentality-materiality — this should be regarded as like
 the arising of severe pain for that man conditioned by the wound openings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment consciousness thus, as similar
 to one struck by three hundred spears, eliminates the desire for it.
 This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the man struck
 by three hundred spears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Full Understanding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus by eliminating desire in regard to these nutriments, he also fully
 understands these four nutriments.
 When these have been fully understood, the entire basis (for them) has
 also been fully understood.
 For this has been said by the Blessed One (S.12:63/ii,99-100):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bhikkhus, when the nutriment physical food has been fully understood, lust
 for the five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully understood.
 When lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully understood,
 there exists no more any fetter bound by which the noble disciple might
 come back to this world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bhikkhus, when the nutriment contact has been fully understood, the three
 feelings have been fully understood.
 When the three feelings have been fully understood, there is nothing further
 for the noble disciple to do, I say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bhikkhus, when the nutriment mental volition has been fully understood,
 the three kinds of craving have been fully understood.
 When the three kinds of craving have been fully understood, there is nothing
 further for the noble disciple to do, I say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bhikkhus, when the nutriment consciousness has been fully understood, mentality-
materiality has been fully understood.
 When mentality-materiality has been fully understood, there is nothing
 further for the noble disciple to do, I say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Arising and Cessation of Nutriment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment (tanhasamudaya
 aharasamudayo): This is the meaning: "With the arising of craving in the
 previous (existence) the arising of the nutriments occurs at rebirth-linking
 (in this existence)." How? Because at the moment of rebirth-linking there
 is the nutritive essence produced among the thirty types of materiality
 that have arisen by way of triple continuity.38 This is the kammically acquired
 physical food as nutriment produced by craving as its condition.
 But the contact and volition associated with the rebirth-linking consciousness,
 and that mind or consciousness itself — these are the kammically acquired
 nutriments of contact, mental volition and consciousness produced by craving
 as their condition.
 Thus, in the first place, the arising of the nutriments at rebirth-linking
 should be understood as occurring with the arising of craving in the previous
 existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But because the nutriments that are kammically acquired and those that are
 not kammically acquired have been discussed here combined, (the principle
 of) the arising of nutriment with the arising of craving should be understood
 to apply also to those that are not kammically acquired.
 For there is nutritive essence in the kinds of materiality that are aroused
 by the eight types of consciousness accompanied by greed;39 this is the
 nutriment physical food that is not kammically acquired yet is produced
 by conascent craving as its condition.
 But the contact and volition associated with the consciousness accompanied
 by greed, and that mind or consciousness itself — these are the nutriments
 of contact, mental volition and consciousness that are not kammically acquired
 yet are produced by craving as their condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the cessation of craving there is cessation of nutriment (tanhanirodha
 aharanirodho): By this there is set forth the cessation of nutriment by
 the cessation of the craving that had become the condition for both nutriment
 that is kammically acquired and that which is not kammically acquired.
 The rest (should be understood) by the method stated, but there is this
 difference.
 Here the four truths are stated directly, and as here, so in all the following
 sections.
 Therefore one who is unconfused in mind can deduce the truths throughout
 in what follows.40
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
12.
 And in all the following sections the delimiting phrase In that way too,
 friends (ettavata pi kho avuso) should be construed according to the principle
 that has been expounded.
 Here, in the first place, this is the interpretation of it (in the present
 context).
 "In that way too": what is meant is: "the attention and penetration stated
 by way of the teaching concerning nutriment." The same method throughout.

The Four Noble Truths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
14.
 Now, delighting and rejoicing in the Elder's words, after saying as before
 "Good, friend," the bhikkhus asked a further question, and the Elder answered
 them by another exposition.
 This method is found in all the following sections.
 Therefore, from here onwards, we shall explain the meaning only of the
 particular exposition he states in reply, without touching upon such words
 (as are already explained).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
15.
 In the brief exposition of this teaching, in the phrase (he) understands
 suffering (dukkham pajanati), "suffering" is the truth of suffering.
 But regarding the detailed exposition, whatever needs to be said has all
 been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Truths
 (XVI,13-104).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aging and Death
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
21.
 From here onwards the teaching is given by way of dependent arising (paticca
 samuppada).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
22.
 Therein, in the section on aging and death, firstly as to the term their
 (tesam tesam) — this should be understood as a collective designation in
 brief for the many kinds of beings.
 For if one were to state (the aging of individuals such as) the aging of
 Devadatta, the aging of Somadatta, etc., one would never come to an end
 of beings.
 But there is no being not included by this term "their."41 Therefore it
 was said above: "This should be understood as a collective designation
 in brief for the many kinds of beings."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the various (tamhi tamhi): This is a collective designation for the many
 (different) orders by way of destiny and birth.
 Orders of beings (sattanikaye): an indication of the nature of what is
 designated by the collective designation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aging, old age (jara jiranata), etc.: As regards these, "aging" is the descriptio
n of the nature; "old age" is the description of the aspect; "brokenness,"
 etc., are descriptions of the function with respect to the passage of time;
 and the last two terms are descriptions of the normal (process).
 For this is indicated as to nature by this term aging (jara); hence this
 is a description of its nature.
 It is indicated as to aspect by this term old age (jiranata); hence this
 is a description of its aspect.
 Brokenness (khandicca): by this it is indicated as to the function of causing
 the broken state of teeth and nails on account of the passage of time.
 Grayness (palicca): by this it is indicated as to the function of causing
 the head hairs and body hairs to turn gray.
 Wrinkling (valittacata): by this it is indicated as to the wrinkled state
 of the skin after the withering of the flesh.
 Hence the three terms beginning with brokenness are descriptions of function
 with respect to the passage of time.
 By these evident aging is shown, which becomes evident by the showing of
 these alterations.
 For just as the course taken by water or wind or fire is evident from the
 damaged and broken state, or the burnt state, of the grass and trees, etc.,
 and yet the course that has been taken is not the water, etc., itself, so
 too the course taken by aging is evident through brokenness of teeth, etc.,
 and it is apprehended by opening the eyes, but the brokenness, etc., themselves
 are not aging, nor is aging cognizable by the eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decline of life, weakness of faculties (ayuno samhani indriyanam paripako):
 By these terms it is indicated by means of the normal (process) known as
 the exhaustion of the life-span and the weakening of the eye faculty, etc.,
 that has become manifest with the passage of time.
 Hence these last two are to be understood as descriptions of its normal
 (process).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein, because the life-span of one who has reached aging is dwindling,
 aging is called "decline of life" as a metaphor (for the cause stated in
 terms) of its effect.
 And because the eye faculty, etc.
 — which at the time of youth were quite clear and could easily grasp even
 subtle objects — become deficient, obscure, unable to grasp even gross
 objects when one has reached old age, therefore it is called "weakness
 of faculties" also as a metaphor (for the cause stated in terms) of its
 effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This aging, thus described, is all of two kinds, evident and concealed.
 Therein, the aging of material phenomena, shown by brokenness, etc., is
 called evident aging (pakatajara).
 But in the case of immaterial phenomena, because their alteration in such
 a way is not visible, their aging is called concealed aging (paticchannajara).
 Therein, the brokenness that is seen is simply color (vanna) because of
 the ease of comprehending such things as the teeth, etc.
 Having seen this with the eye and reflected on it with the mind door, one
 knows aging thus: "These teeth have been afflicted by aging," just as one
 knows the existence of water below when one has noticed the heads of cows,
 etc., bound to the place where the water is located.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, aging is twofold thus: as continuous and as discrete.
 Therein, continuous aging (avicijara) is the aging of such things as gems,
 gold, silver, coral, the sun and moon, etc.; it is so called because of
 the difficulty of perceiving in such things distinct changes in color,
 etc., at regular intervals, as we can in the case of living beings passing
 through the decade of childhood, etc., and in the case of vegetation (lit.
 non-breathing things) such as flowers, fruits, buds, etc.
 The meaning is: aging that progresses without interval.
 Discrete aging (savicijara) is the aging of the things other than those,
 i.e., of the aforesaid things (living beings and vegetation); it is so called
 because it is easy to perceive in them distinct changes in color, etc.,
 at regular intervals.
 So it should be understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following this (in the definition of death) the term their (tesam tesam)
 should be understood by the method stated above (in the definition of aging).
 Then, in the expression passing, passing away, etc., passing (cuti) is said
 by way of what has the nature to pass away; this is a collective designation
 (applying) to one-, four-, and five-aggregate (existence).
 Passing away (cavanata) is the indication of the characteristic by a word
 expressing the abstract state.
 Dissolution (bheda) is an indication of the occurrence of the breaking
 up of the aggregates (at the time) of passing.
 Disappearance (antaradhana) is an indication of the absence of any manner
 of persistence of the aggregates (at the time) of passing, as they are
 broken like a broken pot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dying (maccu marana): death which is called dying.
 By this he rejects the idea of death as complete annihilation.
 Completion of time (kalakiriya): time is the destroyer, and this (completion
 of time) is its activity.
 By this he explains death in conventional terminology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, to explain death in (terms valid in) the ultimate sense, he next says
 the dissolution of the aggregates (khandhanam bhedo), etc.42 For in the
 ultimate sense it is only the aggregates that break up; it is not any so
 called being that dies.
 But when the aggregates are breaking up convention says "a being is dying,"
 and when they have broken up convention says "(he is) dead."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of four- [and five-]
 constituent being; the laying down of the body (kalevarassa nikkhepo) by
 way of one-constituent being.43 Or alternatively, the dissolution of the
 aggregates is said by way of four-constituent being; the laying down of
 the body should be understood by way of the other two (i.e., one- and five-consti
tuent being).
 Why? Because of the existence of the body, that is, the material body,
 in those two realms of being.
 Or else, because in the realm of the Four Great Kings, etc., the aggregates
 simply break up and they do not lay anything down, the dissolution of the
 aggregates is said with reference to them.44 The laying down of the body
 occurs among human beings, etc.
 And here, because it is the cause for the laying down of the body, death
 is called the laying down of the body.
 Thus the meaning should be understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this aging and this death are what is called aging and death (iti ayan
 ca jara idan ca maranam idam vuccat'avuso jaramaranam): this is spoken
 of as "aging and death" by combining the two into one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Birth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
26.
 In the section on birth, in regard to the phrase birth,...
 their coming to birth, etc., birth (jati) is in the sense of being born;
 this is stated with reference to those (conceived) with incomplete sense
 bases.
 Coming to birth (sanjati) is in the sense of the act of coming to birth;
 this is stated with reference to those (conceived) with already complete
 sense bases.
 Precipitation (or descent, okkanti) is in the sense of being precipitated
 (descending).
 This is stated with reference to those born from the egg and from the womb,
 for they take rebirth-linking as though descending and entering the egg
 shell or the placenta.
 Generation (abhinibbatti) is in the sense of being generated.
 This is stated with reference to those born from moisture or those of spontaneo
us birth, for these are generated as soon as they become manifest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now comes the exposition in (terms valid in) the ultimate sense.
 Manifestation (patubhava) is the arising.
 Of the aggregates (khandhanam) is to be understood as (the arising) of
 one aggregate in the one-constituent realm of being, of four aggregates
 in four-constituent realms, and of five aggregates in five-constituent
 realms.
 Obtaining (patilabha) is the manifestation in continuity.
 The bases (ayatananam) should be understood as comprising the sense bases
 arising (at conception) in this or that realm.
 For when the sense bases become manifest, then they are said to be obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is called birth (ayam vuccat'avuso jati): by this phrase he comes to
 the conclusion on birth taught in both conventional terms and in the ultimate
 sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of being (bhavasamudaya): but here one should understand
 kammically active being as the condition for birth.
 The rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
30.
 In the section on being, sense-sphere being (kamabhava) is kammically active
 being and resultant being.
 Therein, kammically active being (kammabhava) is kamma itself that leads
 to sense-sphere being.
 For that is called "being" as a designation of the cause in terms of its
 effect, because it is the cause for resultant being, as when it is said:
 "The arising of Buddhas is bliss" and "The accumulation of evil is painful"
 (Dhp.
 194, 117).
 Resultant being (upapattibhava) is the group of kammically acquired aggregates
 produced by that kamma.
 For that is called "being" because it exists there.
 Thus this kamma and this result are both spoken of conjointly as "sense-sphere
 being." The same method applies to fine-material being and immaterial being
 (ruparupabhava).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of clinging (upadanasamudaya): But here clinging is a condition
 for wholesome kammically active being only by way of decisive support;
 it is a condition for unwholesome kammically active being by way of both
 decisive support and conascence.45 For all resultant being it is a condition
 only by way of decisive support.
 The rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clinging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
34.
 In the section on clinging, in regard to the phrase "clinging to sense
 pleasures," etc., clinging to sense pleasures (kamupadana) is analyzed thus:
 by this one clings to the object of sensual pleasure, or this itself clings
 to it.
 Or alternatively: that is a sensual pleasure and it is clinging, thus it
 is clinging to sensual pleasure.
 It is firm grasping (dalhagahana) that is called clinging.
 For here the prefix upa has the sense of firmness.
 This is a designation for the lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure.
 This is the brief account here.
 The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus: "Therein,
 what is clinging to sensual pleasures? The sensual desire in regard to
 sensual pleasures," etc.
 (Dhs.
 Section 1214).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So too, that is a view and clinging, thus it is clinging to views (ditthupadana).
 Or alternatively: it clings to a view, or by this they cling to a view.
 For the subsequent view clings to the previous view and thereby they cling
 to the view.
 As it is said: "Self and the world are eternal; only this is true, anything
 else is false," etc.
 (M.102/ii, 233).
 This is a designation for the whole field of (wrong) views except clinging
 to rituals and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self.46 This is
 the brief account here.
 The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus: "Therein,
 what is clinging to views? There is nothing given," etc.
 (Dhs.
 Section 1215).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So too, by this they cling to rituals and observances, or this itself clings
 to them, or that is a ritual and observance and clinging, thus it is clinging
 to rituals and observances (silabbatupadana).
 For when one adheres to the idea that the cow ritual or cow observance
 brings purification, that itself is a clinging.47 This is the brief account
 here.
 The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus: "Therein,
 what is clinging to rituals and observances? (The idea) of recluses and
 brahmans outside here (i.e., outside the Buddha's dispensation) that purity
 (is achieved) by rules," etc.
 (Dhs.
 Section 1216).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now they assert in terms of this, thus it is a doctrine.
 By this they cling, thus it is clinging.
 What do they assert? Or what do they cling to? Self.
 The clinging to a doctrine about a self is the clinging to a doctrine of
 self (attavadupadana).
 Or alternatively: by this a mere doctrine of self is clung to as self,
 thus it is clinging to a doctrine of self.
 This is a designation for personality view with its twenty cases.
 This is the brief account here.
 The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus: "Therein,
 what is clinging to a doctrine of self? Here, the uninstructed worldling
 who has no regard for noble ones," etc.
 (Dhs.
 Section 1217).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of craving (tanhasamudaya): here, craving is a condition
 for clinging to sensual pleasures either by way of decisive support or
 by way of proximity, contiguity, absence, disappearance and repetition.48
 But for the rest (it is a condition) by way of conascence, etc., too.
 The rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Craving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
38.
 In the section on craving, craving for forms...
 craving for mind-objects (rupatanha...
 dhammatanha): these are names for the kinds of craving which occur in the
 course of a javana cognitive process (javanavithi) in the eye door, etc.
 Like a name derived from the father, such as Setthiputta ("merchant's son")
 or Brahmanaputta ("brahman's son"), their names are derived from the object,
 which is similar to the father [as being the cause (hetu) of it only, not
 as is the case with "eye-contact," which is like a name derived from the
 mother in that (the eye like the mother in relation to her son) is a cause
 by its nature as a physical support (nissayabhava)].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And here, craving for forms is craving that has forms as its object, craving
 in regard to forms.
 When this occurs by finding gratification in visible forms through its
 nature as sensual lust, it is craving for sensual pleasure (kamatanha).
 When it occurs by finding gratification in visible forms, thinking "Form
 is permanent, lasting, eternal," through its nature as lust accompanied
 by the eternalist view, then it is craving for being (bhavatanha).
 When it occurs by finding gratification in visible form, thinking "Form
 is annihilated, destroyed, and does not exist after death," through its
 nature as lust accompanied by the annihilationist view, then it is craving
 for non-being (vibhavatanha).
 Thus it is threefold.
 And as craving for form, so too craving for sound, etc., (are each threefold
 too).
 Thus there are eighteen modes of craving.
 These eighteen in respect of internal visible form, etc., and in respect
 of external visible form, etc., come to thirty-six.
 So thirty-six in the past, thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six at
 present make up a hundred and eight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or there are eighteen based on internal form, etc., thus: "On account of
 the internal there is (the notion) 'I am,' there is (the notion) 'I am
 such and such,' " and so on; and there are eighteen based on external form,
 etc., thus: "On account of the external there is (the notion) 'I am,' there
 is (the notion) 'I am such and such,' " and so on.
 Thus there are thirty-six.
 So thirty-six in the past, thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six at
 present make up thus the hundred and eight modes of craving (tanhavicaritani;
 see A.
 4:199/ii, 212).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, when a classification is made, they reduce to only six classes of
 craving — in terms of their objects, forms and the rest — and to only three
 types of craving — craving for sensual pleasure and the rest.
 Thus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Craving should be known by the wise Through description and when described
 In detail; it (should be known) again Through classification of the detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of feeling there is the arising of craving (vedanasamudaya
 tanhasamudayo): But here the word "feeling" is intended as resultant feeling.49
 How is that the condition for craving in respect of the six sense doors?
 Because of its ability to produce gratification.
 For it is through the gratification in pleasant feeling that beings become
 enamored of that feeling, and after arousing craving for feeling and being
 seized by lust for feeling, they long only for a desirable visible form
 in the eye door.
 And on getting it, they find gratification in it, and they honor painters,
 etc., who provide such objects.
 Likewise, they long only for a desirable sound, etc., in the ear door, etc.
 And on getting it, they find gratification in it, and they honor musicians,
 perfume makers, cooks, spinners and the teachers of the various crafts.
 Like what? Like those who, being enamored of a child, out of love for the
 child honor the wet-nurse and give her suitable ghee, milk, etc., to eat
 and drink.
 The rest by the method stated.

\begin_layout Standard
Feeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
42.
 In the section on feeling, classes of feeling (vedanakaya) means groups
 of feeling.
 Feeling born of eye-contact...
 feeling born of mind-contact (cakkhusamphassaja vedana...
 manosamphassaja vedana): because of what has come down in the Vibhanga
 thus: "There is feeling born of eye-contact that is wholesome, that is
 unwholesome, that is indeterminate" (Vibh.
 15), the wholesome, unwholesome and indeterminate feelings that occur in
 the eye door, etc., are named after the physical base, which is similar
 to a mother, just as some are named after their mother, such as "Sariputta
 (Lady Sari's son)," "Mantaniputta (Lady Mantani's son)," etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the word meaning here is this: feeling born of eye-contact (cakkhusamphassaj
a vedana) is feeling that is born with eye-contact as the cause.
 The same method throughout.
 This, in the first place, is the all-inclusive explanation.
 But by way of resultant, in the eye-door there are two eye-consciousnesses,
 two mind elements, three mind-consciousness elements; feeling should be
 understood as what is associated with these.50 This method also applies
 in the ear door, etc.
 In the mind door, (feeling) is associated only with the mind-consciousness
 elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of contact (phassasamudaya): But here the arising in the
 five doors of the feelings that have the five physical bases (as their
 support) occurs with the arising of the conascent eye-contact.
 For the rest, eye-contact, etc., are conditions by way of decisive support.
 In the mind door, the arising of feelings (on the occasion) of registration
 and of the doorless feelings (on the occasions) of rebirth-linking, life-contin
uum and death occurs with the arising of the conascent mind-contact.51 The
 rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contact
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
46.
 In the section on contact, eye-contact (cakkhusamphassa) is contact in
 the eye.
 The same method throughout.
 Eye-contact...
 body-contact (cakkhusamphasso...
 kayasamphasso): up to this point ten kinds of contact have been stated,
 namely, the wholesome- and unwholesome-resultants having the five physical
 bases (as their support).
 Mind-contact (manosamphassa): by this (he indicates) the remaining twenty-two
 kinds of contact associated with the mundane resultant (types of consciousness).
52
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of the sixfold base (salayatanasamudaya): The arising of
 this sixfold contact should be understood to occur by way of the arising
 of the six bases beginning with the eye-base.
 The rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Sixfold Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
50.
 In the section on the sixfold base, as regards the eye-base (cakkhayatana),
 etc., whatever should be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga
 in the Description of the Aggregates and in the Description of the Bases
 (XIV, 37-52; XV, 1-16).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of mentality-materiality (namarupasamudaya): But here the
 arising of the sixfold base should be understood to occur from the arising
 of mentality-materiality according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga
 in the Description of Dependent Arising, as to which mentality, which materiali
ty, and which mentality-materiality are a condition for which base (XVII,
 206-219).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mentality-Materiality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
54.
 In the section on mentality-materiality, mentality (nama) has the characteristi
c of bending (namana); materiality (rupa) has the characteristic of being
 molested (ruppana).53 In the detailed section, however, feeling (vedana)
 is to be understood as the feeling aggregate, perception (sañña) as the
 perception aggregate, and volition, contact and attention (cetana phasso
 manasikaro) as the formations aggregate.
 While it is certainly the case that other states are included in the formations
 aggregate, still these three are found in all classes of consciousness,
 even the weakest.
 That is why the formations aggregate is here pointed out only by means
 of these three.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four great elements (cattari mahabhutani): this is a designation for
 the four — earth, water, fire and air.
 The reason why these are called "great elements," and other determinations
 concerning them, are all stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description
 of the Materiality Aggregate.54
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Derived from the four great elements (catunnan ca mahabhutanam upadaya):
 derived from (upadaya) = having clung to (upadayitva); "having grasped"
 is the meaning.
 Some also say "depending upon" (nissaya).
 And here the reading is completed by adding the word "existing" (vattamanam).
 The Pali uses the genitive (in the term for the elements) in the sense
 of a group.
 Hence the meaning here should be understood thus: the materiality that
 exists derived from the group of the four great elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus materiality taken altogether is to be understood as consisting of all
 the following: the four great elements beginning with the earth element,
 and the materiality that exists derived from the four great elements, stated
 in the canonical Abhidhamma to be of twenty-three kinds by analysis into
 the eye-base, etc.55
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of consciousness (viññanasamudaya): But here the arising
 of mentality-materiality should be understood to occur with the arising
 of consciousness according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in
 the Description of Dependent Arising, as to which consciousness is a condition
 for which mentality, for which materiality, and for which mentality-materiality
 (XVII, 186-202).
 The rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consciousness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
58.
 In the section on consciousness, eye-consciousness (cakkhuviññana) is conscious
ness in the eye or consciousness born from the eye.
 So also with ear-, nose-, tongue- and body-consciousness.
 But with the other one, i.e., mind-consciousness (manoviññana), mind itself
 is consciousness.
 This is a designation for the resultant consciousness of the three (mundane)
 planes of existence except for the two groups of fivefold consciousness.56
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of formations (sankharasamudaya): But here the arising
 of consciousness should be understood to occur with the arising of formations
 according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga, as to which formation
 is a condition for which consciousness (XVII, 175-185).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
62.
 In the section on formations, a formation (sankhara) has the characteristic
 of forming (abhisankharanalakkhana).
 But in the detailed section, the bodily formation (kayasankhara) is a formation
 that proceeds from the body.
 This is a designation for the twenty kinds of bodily volition — the eight
 sense-sphere wholesome and twelve unwholesome — that occur by way of activation
 in the bodily door.57 The verbal formation (vacisankhara) is a formation
 that proceeds from speech.
 This is a designation for the (same) twenty kinds of verbal volition that
 occur by way of breaking into speech in the door of speech.
 The mental formation (cittasankhara) is a formation that proceeds from
 the mind.
 This is a designation for the twenty-nine kinds of mental volition — the
 mundane wholesome and unwholesome — that occur in one sitting alone in
 thought, and which do not cause activation of the bodily and verbal doors.58
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of ignorance (avijjasamudaya): But here ignorance should
 be understood as a condition for the wholesome by way of decisive support
 and for the unwholesome by way of conascence as well.
 The rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ignorance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
66.
 In the section on ignorance, not knowing about suffering (dukkhe aññanam)
 means not knowing about the truth of suffering.
 This is a designation for delusion (moha).
 The same method with respect to "not knowing about the origin of suffering,"
 and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein, not knowing about suffering should be understood in four ways: as
 to containment (antogadhato), as to physical basis (vatthuto), as to object
 (arammanato), and as to concealment (paticchadanato).
 Thus, because of being included in the truth of suffering, it ("not knowing"
 or ignorance) is contained in suffering; and the truth of suffering is
 its physical basis by being its support condition; and (the truth of suffering)
 is its object by being its object condition; and it conceals the truth
 of suffering by preventing the penetration of its real characteristic and
 by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not knowing about the origin (of suffering) should be understood in three
 ways: as to physical basis, as to object, and as to concealment.
 And not knowing about cessation and the way (to cessation) should be understood
 in one way only: as to concealment.
 For non-knowledge only conceals cessation and the way by preventing the
 penetration of their real characteristics and by not allowing knowledge
 to occur in regard to them.
 But it is not contained in them because it is not included in this pair
 of truths.
 And these two truths are not its physical basis because they are not conascent.
 Nor are they its object because of its non-occurrence on account of them.
 For the last pair of truths are difficult to see because of their profundity,
 and non-knowledge, which is blind, does not occur there.
 But the first (pair of truths) is profound in the sense of opposition because
 of the difficulty in seeing the characteristic of their intrinsic nature;
 it occurs there by way of obsession by the perversions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore: About suffering (dukkhe): to this extent ignorance is indicated
 as to inclusion, as to physical basis, as to object, and as to function.
 About the origin of suffering (dukkhasamudaye): to this extent, as to basis,
 as to object, and as to function.
 About the cessation of suffering (dukkhanirodhe) and about the way leading
 to the cessation of suffering (dukkhanirodhagaminiya patipadaya): to this
 extent, as to function.
 But without distinction, (in each instance) ignorance is described in terms
 of its intrinsic nature by the phrase "not knowing."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the arising of the taints (asavasamudaya): But here the taint of sensual
 desire and the taint of being are conditions for ignorance by way of conascence
, etc.; the taint of ignorance, only by way of decisive support.
 And here the ignorance that had arisen previously should be understood
 as the taint of ignorance.
 That is a decisive support condition for the ignorance that arises subsequently.
 The rest by the method stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Taints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
70.
 In the section on the taints, with the arising of ignorance (avijjasamudaya):
 Here ignorance is a condition for the taint of sensual desire and the taint
 of being by way of decisive support, etc.; (it is a condition) for the taint
 of ignorance only by way of decisive support.
 And here the ignorance that arises subsequently should be understood as
 the taint of ignorance.
 The previously arisen ignorance itself becomes a decisive support condition
 for the subsequently arisen taint of ignorance.
 The rest by the aforesaid method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section is stated by way of showing the condition for the ignorance
 which heads the factors of dependent arising.
 Stated thus, the undiscoverability (anamataggata) of any beginning of samsara
 is established.
 How? Because with the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance,
 and with the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taints.
 Thus the taints are a condition for ignorance, and ignorance is a condition
 for the taints.
 Having shown this, (it follows that) no first point of ignorance is manifest,
 and because none is manifest the undiscoverability of any beginning of
 samsara is proven.59

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus in all this sutta sixteen sections have been stated: the section on
 the courses of kamma, the section on nutriment, the section on suffering,
 and the sections on aging and death, birth, being, clinging, craving, feeling,
 contact, the sixfold base, mentality-materiality, consciousness, formations,
 ignorance and the taints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to these, in each individual section there is a twofold analysis — in
 brief and in detail — amounting to thirty-two cases.
 Thus in this sutta, in these thirty-two cases, the Four (Noble) Truths
 are expounded.
 Among these, in the sixteen cases stated in detail, arahantship is expounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But according to the opinion of the Elder, the four truths and the four
 paths are expounded in the thirty-two cases.60 Thus in the entire Word of
 the Buddha comprised in the five great Nikayas, there is no sutta except
 for this Discourse on Right View where the Four (Noble) Truths are explained
 thirty-two times and where arahantship is explained thirty-two times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is what the Venerable Sariputta said (idam avoc'ayasma Sariputto):
 The Venerable Sariputta spoke this Discourse on Right View, having adorned
 it with sixty-four divisions — thirty-two expositions of the four truths
 and thirty-two expositions of arahantship.
 The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputta's
 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Papañcasudani, the Commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya, the Explanation
 of the Discourse on Right View is concluded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.The term sammaditthi is ordinarily used to mean simply a state, the path
 factor of right view.
 Here, however, the Pali expression is used as a masculine noun to mean,
 in the first instance, a person possessing right view; hence it has been
 rendered "one of right view." The commentator contrasts this unusual usage
 of the term with the more common usage where sammaditthi signifies a state
 (dhamma), that is, the path factor rather than the individual endowed with
 that state.2.The knowledge of kamma as one's own (kammassakatañana) is often
 expressed in the Suttas thus: "I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of
 my kamma, I spring from my kamma, I am bound to my kamma, I have kamma
 as my refuge.
 Whatever kamma I perform, good or bad, of that I am the heir." In short,
 it is knowledge of the moral efficacy of action, of the fact that one's
 willed deeds fashion one's destiny.
 Knowledge in conformity with the truths (saccanulomikañana) is conceptual
 knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, accompanied by understanding and acceptance
 of them.3.The understanding or wisdom (pañña) connected with the paths and
 fruits is supramundane because its object is the supramundane dhamma, Nibbana,
 and because it leads to the overcoming of the world.4.A disciple in higher
 training (sekha) is one at any of the three lower levels of sanctity —
 a stream-enterer, once-returner, or non-returner — or one who has reached
 their respective paths.
 His right view is said to be fixed in destiny (niyata) because it necessarily
 leads to final liberation.5.The "one beyond training" (asekha) is the arahant,
 so called because he has completed the threefold training in virtue, concentrat
ion and wisdom.6.The ninefold supramundane Dhamma: the four paths, the four
 fruitions, and Nibbana.7.The interpretation of "the bhikkhus" and "the Elder"
 is offered by Sub.
 Cy., which also presents an alternative interpretation, based on the commentary
 to the Vatthupama Sutta (M.7) according to which the bhikkhus are the pupils
 of the Elder Mahasangharakkhita and "the Elder" is the Elder Mahasangharakkhita.
8.See commentary to the third parajika offence.9.See commentary to the second
 parajika offence.10.The meaning of several of these terms, obscure in the
 original Pali, has been elaborated with the aid of the Sub.
 Cy.11.Consent (adhivasana) is included to cover the case where one of the
 partners is initially an unwilling victim of another's assault, but during
 the course of union consents to the act and thereby becomes a participant.12.Thes
e are references to the two great classics of Hindu India, the Mahabharata
 and the Ramayana.13.Wrong views of fixed destiny (niyata micchaditthi) are
 views which deny the moral efficacy of action or which tend to undermine
 the foundations of morality.
 For the most common examples, see D.2/i, 52-56, and M.76/i, 515-18.14.The chief
 factor in the first seven courses of kamma is volition; the other three
 courses are identical with the mental factors of greed, hatred and wrong
 view, which are associated with volition in the states of consciousness
 in which they arise.15.This refers to the Abhidhamma classification of consciousn
ess, according to which wholesome sense-sphere consciousness is of eight
 types, four associated with knowledge, four dissociated from knowledge.
 The abstinences, according to the Abhidhamma, occur in sense-sphere consciousne
ss only one at a time on occasions when one deliberately abstains from some
 wrong.
 In supramundane consciousness all three abstinences — right speech, right
 action and right livelihood — occur together simultaneously.16.Right view
 is synonymous with the mental factor of wisdom (pañña) or non-delusion
 (amoha); it is always accompanied by the other two wholesome roots, though
 the latter do not necessarily occur in conjunction with right view.17.Literally,
 or in the strict sense (nippariyayena), only covetousness and greed, being
 synonyms of craving (tanha), count as the origin of suffering.
 But in a looser or figurative manner of exposition (pariyayena) all the
 roots are the truth of the origin, since as roots of kamma they help to
 sustain the round of rebirth and suffering.18.The guideline of conversion
 (avattahara) is one of the methods of deduction in the exegetical guide,
 the Nettippakarana.
 According to this guideline, an expositor of a sutta is to extract from
 a particular text a standard doctrinal concept belonging to a dichotomy,
 and then taking this concept as a basis, he is to show that the other member
 of the dichotomy is also implied by the passage under consideration, and
 therefore "turns up" when the first member is mentioned.19.The path of non-return
 (anagamimagga) is stated because this path eradicates all sensual lust
 and aversion.20.The path of arahantship is implied by the eradication of
 conceit and ignorance and by the arousing of true knowledge.21.The verb aharati
 normally means "to bring," but here it is rendered as "nourish" to underscore
 its connection with ahara, nutriment.22.On the four yoni or modes of generation,
 see M.12/i, 73.23.According to the Abhidhamma, the nutriment proper is the
 material phenomenon called nutritive essence (oja), while the solid food
 ingested is the mere "basis" (vatthu) of the nutritive essence.24.The point
 is that while in conventional terms food substances are distinguished as
 gross or subtle, this distinction is made in terms of the physical base
 only.
 The Abhidhamma classifies nutritive essence as subtle materiality (sukhumarupa)
; it contrasts with gross materiality (olarikarupa), which includes only
 the five sense organs and their objects.25.This is the highest realm among
 the sense-sphere heavens.
 Above this come the Brahma realms, where physical nutriment is non-existent.26.Th
is is the simplest kind of material group (rupakalapa) recognized by the
 Abhidhamma theory of matter.
 It consists of the four primary elements, along with color, smell, taste,
 and nutritive essence.
 All the more complex material groups also contain these eight phenomena
 as their foundation.
 Material groups in a living organism require an input of nutriment in order
 to endure in continuity.27.Conascence condition (sahajatapaccaya) is the
 condition whereby the conditioning state contributes to the arising or
 maintenance of another state, the conditionally arisen state, when the
 latter arises simultaneously with itself.
 Consciousness is a conascence condition for the three other mental aggregates
 — feeling, perception and mental formations — both at rebirth and during
 the course of life.
 At rebirth it is also a conascence condition for the "triple continuity,"
 i.e., the three material decads of body-sensitivity, sexual determination
 and the heart-base.
 Each of these consists of the above-mentioned eight material units along
 with physical life and, as the tenth factor, the material phenomenon after
 which it is named.28.Kammically acquired materiality (upadinnarupa) is matter
 that is born of kamma.
 It includes the physical sense faculties, the life faculty, masculinity,
 femininity, and the coexisting material phenomena in the same group.
 Though such types of matter are produced by kamma rather than by nutriment,
 they require nutriment to sustain them in continuity.29.The Lakkhana Samyutta
 (S.19/ii, 254-62) describes the torments experienced by beings in the realm
 of the petas or "afflicted spirits."30.These similes are taken from the Puttamams
a Sutta, the Discourse on Son's Flesh (S.12:63/ii, 97-100).
 See Nyanaponika Thera, The Four Nutriments of Life (BPS Wheel No.
 104/105, 1967), pp.
 19-40, for the sutta along with its commentary.31.A yojana is about seven
 miles.32.The cow-observance and the dog-observance are forms of self-mortificatio
n which ascetics of the Buddha's time practiced in the hope of purification;
 see M.57/i, 387.
 Apparently, women also observed them for short periods in the hope they
 would make them fertile.33.The commentary to the Puttamamsa Sutta develops
 this analogy in greater detail than the present commentary.34.The sutta elaborate
s as follows: If the cow stands, the creatures in the air attack it; if
 it leans against a wall, the creatures in the wall attack it; if it lies
 down, the creatures in the ground attack it; if it enters a pool of water,
 the creatures in the water attack it.35.Contact arises from the coming together
 of an object, a physical basis or sense faculty (vatthu), and the corresponding
 type of consciousness.36.The simile as given in the sutta is this: Two strong
 men grab hold of a weaker man by both arms and drag him towards a blazing
 charcoal pit.
 He wriggles and struggles to get free because he knows that if he is thrown
 into the pit, he will meet death or deadly pain.37.The king's men arrest
 a thief and bring him before the king.
 The king orders him struck with a hundred spears in the morning, another
 hundred at noon, and a third hundred in the evening.
 The man survives but experiences deadly pain.38.See note 27.39.The eight types
 of consciousness accompanied by greed are distinguished by the presence
 or absence of wrong view, by their accompanying feeling which may be pleasant
 or neutral, and by whether they are spontaneous or prompted.40.The principle
 of the Four Noble Truths can be discerned in the format of the exposition:
 a particular item X, the arising of X, the cessation of X, and the way
 to the cessation of X.41.In Pali the repetition tesam tesam, lit.
 "of them, of them," is understood to imply complete inclusiveness.
 The same applies to tamhi tamhi, "in that, in that," just below.42.Whereas
 the previous definitions were framed in conventional terminology, those
 valid in the ultimate sense (paramatthato) define their subject solely
 in terms of "ultimate realities" such as aggregates and sense bases.43.The
 various realms of existence are analyzed as threefold on the basis of the
 number of aggregates existing there.
 One-constituent being is the non-percipient realm (asannibhumi), which
 includes only the aggregate of material form.
 Four-constituent being is the four immaterial realms, which contain the
 four mental aggregates but not the aggregate of material form.
 Five-constituent being comprises all other realms, in which all five aggregates
 are present.44.It seems that in the sense-sphere heavens, at death the beings
 simply dissipate into thin air, without leaving behind any corpse.45.Decisive
 support condition (upanissayapaccaya) and conascence condition (sahajatapaccaya
) are the two chief conditions among the twenty-four conditions of the Patthana
 or Abhidhammic system of conditional relations.
 Decisive support holds between a conditioning state and a conditioned state
 that it helps to arise across an interval of time.
 Conascence condition holds between a conditioning state and a conditioned
 state that arise simultaneously.
 See also note 27 above.46.Clinging to rituals and observances and clinging
 to a doctrine of self are both types of wrong view, but as they are enumerated
 as individual kinds of clinging in their own right, they are not included
 under clinging to views.47.See above, note 32.48.These are conditional relations
 that hold between successive mind-moments in the javana phase of a single
 cognitive process (cittavithi).49.Resultant feeling alone is intended here
 because this is an exposition of the round of existence, and in the formula
 of dependent arising the factors from consciousness through feeling are
 classified as the resultant phase of the round.50.The two eye-consciousness
 elements are the wholesome-resultant and the unwholesome-resultant; the
 two resultant mind elements are the wholesome-resultant and the unwholesome-res
ultant receiving consciousness (sampaticchanacitta); the three resultant
 mind-consciousness elements are three types of investigating consciousness
 (santiranacitta).51.The registration consciousness (tadarammanacitta) is
 a resultant type of consciousness that occurs through any of the sense
 doors.
 Its function is to register the datum that had been the object of the preceding
 javana series.
 The rebirth, life-continuum (bhavanga) and death consciousnesses are resultants
 that are considered to be "doorless" (advarika) because they occur at an
 inner subliminal level, not through the intercourse of sense organs and
 sense objects.52.This refers to the Abhidhamma classification of thirty-two
 types of resultant consciousness, of which twenty-two remain besides the
 ten types of sense-consciousness, five resultants of the unwholesome and
 five of the wholesome.
 The details are not necessary here.53.These two definitions involve word
 plays difficult to reproduce in English.
 Ven.
 Ñanamoli has a note suggesting, half flippantly, "minding" for namana and
 "mattering" for ruppana.54.In fact the Visuddhimagga discusses the four great
 elements not in its chapter on the Description of the Aggregates (Ch.
 XIV), but in the chapter on the meditation subject called the definition
 of the elements (Ch.
 XI).55.Some instances of derived materiality are: the five sense faculties,
 color, sound, smell, taste, the life faculty, sexual determination, nutritive
 essence, space, etc.56.The three planes of existence were enumerated in Section
 30.
 Only resultant consciousness is taken into account here because this is
 an exposition of the round.57.The figures for the types of consciousness
 again come from the Abhidhamma.
 These types of consciousness can come to expression either through the
 door of bodily action or the door of speech, or they can remain within
 and not gain outer expression.58.The nine types of volition which do not
 come to expression by body or speech are the five volitions of the five
 fine-material-sphere jhanas and the four of the four immaterial-sphere

 discovered, of which it can be said: Before that there was no ignorance
 and it came to be after that" (A.10:61/v,113).
 In that sutta the Buddha cites the five hindrances as the condition for
 ignorance, but as these in turn presuppose ignorance, the vicious cycle
 is again established.60.For the identity of the dissenting Elder, see Section

The Sutta Pitaka, the second division of the Tipitaka, consists of more
 than 10,000 suttas (discourses) delivered by the Buddha and his close disciples
 during and shortly after the Buddha's forty-five year teaching career,
 as well as many additional verses by other members of the Sangha.
 More than one thousand sutta translations are available on this website.

The suttas are grouped into five nikayas, or collections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Digha NikayaThe "Long" Discourses (Pali digha = "long") consists of 34 suttas,
 including the longest ones in the Canon.
 The subject matter of these suttas ranges widely, from colorful folkloric
 accounts of the beings inhabiting the deva worlds (DN 20) to down-to-earth
 practical meditation instructions (DN 22), and everything in between.
 Recent scholarship suggests that a distinguishing trait of the Digha Nikaya
 may be that it was "intended for the purpose of propaganda, to attract
 converts to the new religion." 1Majjhima NikayaThe "Middle-length" Discourses
 (Pali majjhima = "middle") consists of 152 suttas of varying length.
 These range from some of the most profound and difficult suttas in the
 Canon (e.g., MN 1) to engaging stories full of human pathos and drama that
 illustrate important principles of the law of kamma (e.g., MN 57, MN 86).Samyutta
 NikayaThe "Grouped" Discourses (Pali samyutta = "group" or "collection")
 consists of 2,889 relatively short suttas grouped together by theme into
 56 samyuttas.Anguttara NikayaThe "Further-factored" Discourses (Pali anga
 = "factor" + uttara = "beyond," "further") consists of several thousand
 short suttas, grouped together into eleven nipatas according to the number
 of items of Dhamma covered in each sutta.
 For example, the Eka-nipata ("Book of the Ones") contains suttas about
 a single item of Dhamma; the Duka-nipata ("Book of the Twos") contains
 suttas dealing with two items of Dhamma, and so on.Khuddaka Nikaya

Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tucked away in the Samyutta Nikaya among the "connected sayings on causality"
 (Nidanasamyutta) is a short formalized text entitled the Upanisa Sutta,
 the "Discourse on Supporting Conditions." Though at first glance hardly
 conspicuous among the many interesting suttas in this collection, this
 little discourse turns out upon repeated examination to be of tremendous
 doctrinal importance.
 Its great significance derives from the striking juxtaposition it makes
 of two applications of "dependent arising" (paticcasamuppada), the principle
 of conditionality which lies at the heart of the Buddha's doctrine.
 The first application is the usual one, setting forth the causal sequence
 responsible for the origination of samsaric suffering.
 Apart from a slight change it is identical with the twelve-factored formulation
 recurring throughout the Pali canon.
 The change — the substitution of "suffering" for "aging-and-death" as the
 last member of the series — becomes the lead for the second application
 of dependent arising.
 This application, occurring only sporadically in the Pali canon, allows
 the same principle of conditionality to structure the path leading to deliveran
ce from suffering.
 It begins with faith, emerging out of the suffering with which the first
 series ended, and continues through to the retrospective knowledge of liberatio
n, which confirms the destruction of the binding defilements.
 By linking the two series into a single sequence, the sutta reveals the
 entire course of man's faring in the world as well as his treading of the
 path to its transcendence.
 It shows, moreover, that these two dimensions of human experience, the
 mundane and the transcendental, the dimensions of world involvement and
 world disengagement, are both governed by a single structural principle,
 that of dependent arising.
 Recognizing this broader range of the principle, the Nettipakarana, a Pali
 exegetical treatise, has called the second application "transcendental
 dependent arising" (lokuttara-paticcasamuppada).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the great importance of the Upanisa Sutta, traditional commentators
 have hardly given the text the special attention it would seem to deserve.
 Perhaps the reason for this is that, its line of approach being peculiar
 to itself and a few related texts scattered through the Canon, it has been
 overshadowed by the many other suttas giving the more usual presentation
 of doctrine.
 But whatever the explanation be, the need has remained for a fuller exploration
 of the sutta's meaning and implications.
 We have sought to remedy this deficiency with the following work offering
 an English translation of the Upanisa Sutta and an exposition of its message.
 The exposition sets out to explore the second, "transcendental" application
 of dependent arising, drawing freely from other parts of the Canon and
 the commentaries to fill out the meaning.
 Since full accounts of the "mundane" or samsaric side of dependent arising
 can be readily found elsewhere, we thought it best to limit our exposition
 to the principle's less familiar application.
 A similar project has been undertaken by Bhikshu Sangharakshita in his
 book The Three Jewels (London, 1967).
 However, since this work draws largely from Mahayanist sources to explain
 the stages in the series, the need has remained for a treatment which elucidate
s the series entirely from the standpoint of the Theravada tradition, within
 which the sutta is originally found.

Transcendental Dependent Arising
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dependent arising (paticcasamuppada) is the central principle of the Buddha's
 teaching, constituting both the objective content of its liberating insight
 and the germinative source for its vast network of doctrines and disciplines.
 As the frame behind the four noble truths, the key to the perspective of
 the middle way, and the conduit to the realization of selflessness, it
 is the unifying theme running through the teaching's multifarious expressions,
 binding them together as diversified formulations of a single coherent
 vision.
 The earliest suttas equate dependent arising with the unique discovery
 of the Buddha's enlightenment, so profound and difficult to grasp that
 he at first hesitated to announce it to the world.
 A simple exposition of the principle sparks off the liberating wisdom in
 the minds of his foremost disciples, while skill in explaining its workings
 is made a qualification of an adroit expounder of the Dhamma.
 So crucial is this principle to the body of the Buddha's doctrine that
 an insight into dependent arising is held to be sufficient to yield an
 understanding of the entire teaching.
 In the words of the Buddha: "He who sees dependent arising sees the Dhamma;
 he who sees the Dhamma sees dependent arising." 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pali texts present dependent arising in a double form.
 It appears both as an abstract statement of universal law and as the particular
 application of that law to the specific problem which is the doctrine's
 focal concern, namely, the problem of suffering.
 In its abstract form the principle of dependent arising is equivalent to
 the law of the conditioned genesis of phenomena.
 It expresses the invariable concomitance between the arising and ceasing
 of any given phenomenon and the functional efficacy of its originative
 conditions.
 Its phrasing, as terse as any formulation of modern logic, recurs in the
 ancient texts thus: "This being, that exists; through the arising of this
 that arises.
 This not being, that does not exist; through the ceasing of this that ceases."2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When applied to the problem of suffering, the abstract principle becomes
 encapsulated in a twelve-term formula disclosing the causal nexus responsible
 for the origination of suffering.
 It begins with ignorance, the primary root of the series though not a first
 cause, conditioning the arising of ethically determinate volitions, which
 in turn condition the arising of consciousness, and so on through the salient
 occasions of sentient becoming down to their conclusion in old age and
 death:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With ignorance as condition, the kamma formations; with kamma formations
 as condition consciousness; with consciousness as condition, mentality-material
ity; with mentality-materiality as condition the sixfold sense base; with
 the sixfold sense base as condition, contact; with contact as condition,
 feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition,
 clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition,
 birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
 grief, and despair arise.
 Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— SN 12, passim
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corollary of this formula, which constantly accompanies it, describes
 the conditioned cessation of suffering.
 It shows how, when ignorance ceases, all the following conditions successively
 cease, down to the cessation of the "entire mass of suffering."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though the principle of dependent arising is applicable to any situation
 where an origination of phenomena takes place, the Pali Buddhist tradition
 has focused upon the doctrine almost exclusively in terms of its twelvefold
 formulation.
 So much has this been the case that the two have tended to be blankly identifie
d with each other, dependent arising being equated simply with the twelvefold
 series and the twelvefold series being regarded as an exhaustive treatment
 of dependent arising.
 This exclusiveness of emphasis doubtlessly poses a certain danger of rigidity;
 but even despite this danger it is not without its justification.
 For the aim of the Buddha's teaching is not abstract and theoretical, but
 concrete and soteriological.
 Its goal is liberation from suffering, understood in its deepest sense
 as the unsatisfactoriness of sentient existence indefinitely repeated in
 the wheel of becoming, the cycle of births and deaths, called samsara.
 The twelve-term nexus contributes to this liberative thrust by bringing
 the principle of dependent arising to bear directly on the condition which
 it is the doctrine's over-riding concern to ameliorate.
 If suffering is produced by causes, these causes and the way they can be
 stopped must be uncovered and exposed.
 The twelvefold application accomplishes precisely this.
 In its positive or direct aspect (anuloma) it makes known the causal chain
 behind suffering, demonstrating how the round of existence arises and turns
 through the impulsions of craving, clinging, and karma, working freely
 behind the shielding screen of ignorance.
 In its negative or reverse side (patiloma) it reveals the way to the cessation
 of suffering, showing that when ignorance is eliminated by the rise of
 true knowledge all the factors dependent on ignorance likewise draw to
 a close.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, as a consequence of this constriction of attention, sight has tended
 to be lost of the broader range of exemplifications the principle of dependent
 arising might have, even within the limits of the soteriological direction
 of the teaching.
 Dependent arising cannot be reduced to any single one of its applications.
 Any application is only a pedagogical device framed from the standpoint
 of the teaching's practical orientation.
 Above and beyond its specific instances, dependent arising remains an expressio
n of the invariable structural relatedness of phenomena.
 It is a principle to which all phenomena conform by the very nature of
 their being, the principle that whatever comes into existence does so in
 dependence on conditions.
 From the perspective this teaching affords, things are seen to arise, not
 from some intrinsic nature of their own, from necessity, chance or accident,
 but from their causal correlations with other things to which they are
 connected as part of the fixed order obtaining between phenomena.
 Each transient entity, emerging into the present out of the stream of events
 bearing down from the past, absorbs into itself the causal influx of the
 past, to which it must be responsive.
 During its phase of presence it exercises its own distinctive function
 with the support of its conditions, expressing thereby its own immediacy
 of being.
 And then, with the completion of its actuality, it is swept away by the
 universal impermanence to become itself a condition determinant of the
 future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this law of inter-connected becoming, of conditionality and relatedness,
 is extracted from its usual exemplifications and explored for further doctrinal
 bearings, it can be found to have other ramifications equally relevant
 to the realization of the teaching's fundamental aim.
 One particular exemplification of dependent arising,; found with minor
 variations in a number of suttas, shows the basic principle to serve as
 the scaffolding for the course of spiritual development issuing in final
 emancipation.3 It figures in these suttas as the architectonic underlying
 the gradual training, governing the process by which one phase of practice
 conditions the arising of the following phase all the way from the commencement
 of the path to the realization of the ultimate goal.
 To be sure, the application of dependent arising to the achievement of
 deliverance is already covered from one angle by the reverse or cessation
 side of the twelvefold formula, according to which the cessation of ignorance
 sets off a series of cessations culminating in the cessation of suffering.
 Thence in itself such an application is not a unique feature of these suttas.
 What gives these suttas their distinctive quality and value is the positive
 form in which they cast the sequential pattern of the liberative venture.
 Whereas the series of cessations presents the achievement of liberation
 logically, in strict doctrinal terms as the consequence following upon
 the annulment of samsaric bondage, the present sequence views the same
 chain of events dynamically, from the inner perspective of living experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As living experience, the advance to emancipation cannot be tied down to
 a series of mere negations, for such a mode of treatment omits precisely
 what is most essential to the spiritual quest — the immediacy of inner
 striving, growth, and transformation.
 Parallel to the demolition of old barriers there occurs, in the quest for
 deliverance, a widening of vistas characterized by an evolving sense of
 maturation, enrichment, and fulfillment; the departure from bondage, anxiety,
 and suffering at the same time means the move towards freedom and peace.
 This expansion and enrichment is made possible by the structure of the
 gradual training, which is not so much a succession of discrete steps one
 following the other as a locking together of overlapping components in
 a union at once augmentative, consummative, and projective.
 Each pair of stages intertwines in a mutually vitalizing bond wherein the
 lower, antecedent member nurtures its successor by serving as its generative
 base, and the higher, consequent member completes its predecessor by absorbing
 its energies and directing them on to the next phase in the series.
 Each link thus performs a double function: while rewarding the efforts
 expended in the accomplishment of the antecedent stage, it provides the
 incentive for the commencement of the consequent stage.
 In this way the graduated training unfolds organically in a fluid progression
 in which, as the Buddha says, "stage flows over into stage, stage fulfills
 stage, for crossing over from the hither shore to the beyond."4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the factors comprised in this sequence come into being in strict subjection
 to the law of conditioned genesis.
 The accidental, the compulsory, and the mysterious are equally excluded
 by the lawful regularity governing the series.
 The stages of the path do not emerge fortuitously or through the operation
 of some inscrutable power, but originate conditionally, appearing spontaneously
 in the course of training when their requisite conditions are complete.
 Thus the course of spiritual development these suttas reveal is a dependent
 arising — a coming into being in dependence on conditions.
 But this dependent arising differs significantly from its mundane counterpart.
 The mundane version, with its twelve links, describes the movement of samsara,
 which revolves in a perpetually self-regenerating circle leading from beginning
 to end only to find the end lead back to the beginning.
 The mechanism of this process, by which defilements and renewed existence
 mutually kindle one another, is fueled by the hope that some-how some solution
 will yet emerge within the framework of laws set for the turning of the
 wheel, a hope repeatedly disappointed.
 The present version of dependent arising delineates a type of development
 that only becomes possible when this hope has been dispensed with.
 It hinges on the prior recognition that any attempt to eliminate suffering
 through the gratification of craving is doomed to failure, and that the
 only way to stop it is to cut through the vicious nexus at its base.
 Though the movement it describes is still cyclic, it is not the circular
 revolution of samsara it is concerned with but a different kind of rotation
 that only comes into play when the essentially defective nature of the
 ordinary human condition has been clearly perceived and the urge towards
 liberation from it made the dominant motive of the inner life.
 The present sequence depicts the movement towards release.
 It sets forth a drive which, in contrast to the pointless repetition of
 samsara, evolves up and outwards in an unbroken spiral ascent — a pattern
 in which each turn supports and strengthens its successor's capacity for
 liberation, enabling the series as a whole to pick up the momentum needed
 to break the gravitational pull of the mundane sphere.
 Since all the phases in this progression arise in dependence on their anteceden
ts, the series represents a dependent arising.
 But unlike the familiar version of dependent arising, the present version
 leads, not back to the round of becoming, but to the overcoming of samsara
 and all its attendant sufferings.
 Hence the Nettippakarana calls this sequence "transcendental dependent
 arising" (lokuttara paticcasamuppada) — a dependent arising that leads
 to the transcendence of the world.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sutta we will investigate here for an account of "transcendental dependent
 arising, is the Upanisa Sutta of the Nidanasamyutta (SN 12.23).
 In addition to giving a clear, explicit account of the conditional structure
 of the liberative progression, this sutta has the further advantage of
 bringing the supramundane form of dependent arising into immediate connection
 with its familiar samsaric counterpart.
 By making this connection it brings into prominence the comprehensive character
 of the principle of conditionality — its ability to support and explain
 both the process of compulsive involvement which is the origin of suffering
 and the process of disengagement which leads to deliverance from suffering.
 Thereby it reveals dependent arising to be the key to the unity and coherence
 of the Buddha's teaching.
 When the Buddha declares, "I teach only suffering and the cessation of
 suffering,"6 the bond which unites these two terminals of the doctrine
 as complementary sides of a single, internally consistent system is simply
 the law of dependent arising.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Upanisa Sutta gives three expositions of "transcendental dependent arising."
 The first expounds the sequence in reverse order, beginning with the last
 link in the series, the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers (asavakkhay
e ñana), and tracing the chain backwards to the first link in the liberative
 sequence, namely, faith.
 At this point it crosses over to the mundane order, explaining faith as
 arising through suffering, suffering as conditioned by birth, birth as
 conditioned by existence, and so on back through the familiar links to
 ignorance as the first member of the chain.
 After completing the reverse exposition, the Buddha then expounds the same
 series in forward order, beginning with ignorance and following through
 to the knowledge of destruction.
 This he does twice, in exactly the same way, once before and once after
 the striking simile comparing the sequential origination of the factors
 to the gradual descent of rainfall from a mountain, through the graded
 ponds, lakes, streams, and rivers to the great ocean at the mountain's
 base.
 Thus the series of conditions presented in the sutta can be mapped out
 in the abstract as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Ignorance (avijja) Kamma formations (sankhara) Consciousness (viññana) Mentality
-materiality (namarupa) Sixfold sense base (salayatana) Contact (phassa)

 Emancipation (vimutti) Knowledge of destruction of the cankers (asavakkhaye
 ñana)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For ease of explanation we will examine the links of transcendental dependent
 arising in direct order.
 However, before doing so, it is instructive to note that there is special
 significance in the initial presentation of the series in reverse.
 Such a presentation serves to throw an important spotlight on the nature
 of the causal relation obtaining between the path to liberation and its
 goal.
 It shows that the type of causal development displayed by this progression
 is quite different from the pattern of blind efficient causality which
 involves the incidental emergence of an effect out of its causal matrix,
 as for example when a series of geological changes triggers off an earthquake
 or a number of atoms combine to form some new molecule.
 The relationship between the path and the goal belongs to a more complex
 order of causality, one which can perhaps be pictured as a set of prior
 causes giving rise to an effect but can never be adequately and correctly
 comprehended in terms of this model.
 What we have here is not an instance of simple, one-directional causality
 proceeding forward unmodified in a straight line; we have, rather, a species
 of teleological causality involving purpose, intelligence, and planned
 striving simultaneously projected towards and refracted from the aimed
 at effect in a process of reciprocal determination.
 In the workings of this relationship not only does the path facilitate
 the achievement of the goal, but the goal as well, already present from
 the outset as the envisaged aim of striving, itself bends back to participate
 in the shaping of the path.
 Starting from man's awareness of the painful inadequacies of his existence,
 and his intuitive groping towards a condition where these are allayed,
 the formula proceeds to trace back, in terms derivative from and constantly
 checked against the goal, the series of alterations he must induce in his
 cognitive and emotive makeup to bring the goal into his reach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see this pattern illustrated in the traditional account of prince Siddhartha'
s great renunciation.7 When the future Buddha leaves his palace, he goes
 forth in the confidence that beyond the perishable, defective, and substanceles
s things of the world there is accessible to man an unperishable and self-suffic
ient state which makes possible deliverance from suffering.
 What he needs to discover, as the objective of his "holy quest," is the
 path bridging the two domains.
 This he does by pursuing backwards from the goal of striving the obstructions
 to its attainment and the steps to be taken to remove those obstructions.
 One line of exploration begins with aging and death as the fundamental
 manifestation of the suffering which weighs upon the world, and follows
 its chain of conditions back to ignorance as the underlying root.8 Another,
 complementary line starts with the defilements as the principal obstruction
 to emancipation.
 It then finds the defilements to be sustained by ignorance, ignorance by
 the distracted mind, and the distracted mind by a causal nexus going back
 to lack of faith in the true Dhamma.9 From this the conclusion follows,
 as shown in the Upanisa Sutta, that to achieve deliverance the defilements
 must be removed through dispassion, to reach dispassion ignorance must
 be overcome by correct understanding, to arouse understanding the mind
 must be concentrated, and so on through the counter-conditions down to
 the gain of faith in the true Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both cases the reverse direction of the sequential logic reveals the
 peculiar nature of the path-goal relationship.
 The two stand together in a bond of reciprocal determination, the path
 leading to the achievement of the goal and the goal giving form and content
 to the path.
 In addition to the forward thrust of the path, there is thus a basic feedback
 emanating from the goal, so that the goal can, in a sense, generate out
 of itself through the circuit system of man's constitutional capacities
 the series of measures needed to bring about its actualization.
 This relationship is analogous to the relation between a guided missile
 and its mobile target.
 The missile does not reach its target merely through its own initial thrust
 and direction.
 It finds it precisely because it is being controlled by signals the target
 is itself emitting.

\begin_layout Standard
Faith (Saddha)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Suffering is the supporting condition for faith": After asserting as the
 last step in the mundane sequence that birth is the supporting condition
 for suffering, the sutta switches over to the transcendental series with
 the pronouncement that suffering is the supporting condition for faith.
 With respect to both assertions the present formulation diverges from the
 usual version of twelve-factored dependent arising.
 In the usual version the forward sequence ends with the statement that
 birth is the condition for aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
 grief, and despair.
 With this it concludes, leaving unstated the implied aftermath — that this
 "mass of suffering" will generate anew the fundamental ignorance at the
 head of the whole series, thus beginning another run through the cycle.
 The fact that suffering here replaces aging-and-death as the last member
 of the samsaric part of the series therefore has a special importance.
 It cautions us to the impending change, signaling that we are about to
 witness, in the progression of links to follow, not just one more turn
 of the wheel but an interruption of its forward spin and a struggle to
 reverse its natural direction of movement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha's declaration that suffering is the supporting condition for
 faith points to the essential backdrop to the awakening of the religious
 consciousness.
 It reveals that spiritual awareness and the quest for enlightenment do
 not arise spontaneously in harmony with our natural modes of world-engagement,
 but require a turn "against the current" a break away from our instinctual
 urges for expansion and enjoyment and the embarkation in a different direction.
 This break is precipitated by the encounter with suffering.
 Suffering spurs the awakening of the religious consciousness in that it
 is the experience of suffering which first tears us out of our blind absorption
 in the immediacy of temporal being and sets us in search of a way to its
 transcendence.
 Whether in the form of pain, frustration, or distress, suffering reveals
 the basic insecurity of the human condition, shattering our naive optimism
 and unquestioned trust in the goodness of the given order of things.
 It throws before our awareness, in a way we cannot evade, the vast gulf
 stretching between our ingrained expectations and the possibilities for
 their fulfillment in a world never fully susceptible to domination by our
 wills.
 It makes us call into question our schemes of values built upon the bedrock
 of personal expedience.
 It leads to a revaluation of all values and a new scale of worth indifferent
 to the claims of self-concern.
 And it opens us to confidence in an unseen order of relations and inter-connect
ions, an order in which the values that emerge, so often in forceful opposition
 to the old, will find their proper justification and reward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet for suffering to become an effective spur to spiritual awakening it
 is not enough merely to encounter it.
 For the religious consciousness to be aroused suffering must be not only
 met as a constant liability of our existence, but confronted and grappled
 with in the arena of thematic reflection.
 As long as we engage suffering simply in its superficial modes, as felt
 pain and sorrow, we will react to it in one of two ways, both of which
 operate at a purely psychological level.
 In the first case we will react to suffering in an unhealthy manner, as
 when we arouse resentment against the source of our displeasure and seek
 relief by annihilating it, ignoring it, or running away in pursuit of some
 easy escape.
 In the second case we will react to suffering in a mentally healthy way,
 as when we fortify our minds with patience and courage, strengthen our
 capacities for endurance, and seek to resolve the problem in a realistic
 manner.
 But though the second approach is definitely to be preferred to the first,
 in neither case does that inward revolution take place which awakens us
 to our extreme need for deliverance and compels us to set off in a new
 direction previously unknown and unexplored.
 The urge for liberation can only set in when pain and sorrow have been
 confronted with reflective awareness and recognized as symptoms of a deeper
 ailment demanding a radical therapy.
 The quest for a conclusive solution to the problem of suffering begins
 with an act of understanding, not with mere tribulation.
 It starts from the realization that suffering is more than a chance encroachmen
t upon a state of affairs otherwise felicitous, that it is a malady which
 infects our being upwards from its very root.
 We must come to see that the breeding ground of suffering lies not so much
 in the outside world as at the base of our own being, and that any cure
 that is to be permanently effective must uproot it at this inward source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arising of such a realization depends upon the adoption of a new perspective
 from which the fact of suffering can be faced in its full range and universalit
y.
 Though single in its essence, suffering or dukkha yet divides into three
 stages or tiers in accordance with the level of understanding from which
 it is viewed.10 At the most elementary level suffering appears as physical
 pain and oppression, manifest most clearly in the events of birth, sickness,
 aging and death, as well as in hunger, thirst, privation, and bodily discomfort.
 At a higher level it comes to be seen as a psychological fact — as the
 sorrow and frustration springing from our separation from what is desired,
 our meeting with what is disliked, and the disappointment of our expectations.
 And at the third and highest level suffering becomes manifest in its essential
 form, as the inherent unsatisfactoriness of the samsaric round in which
 we turn without purpose on account of our ignorance and attachments.
 These three tiers are not mutually exclusive.
 In each case the lower level serves as basis for the higher, by which it
 is absorbed and comprehended.
 Thus, though the penetration of the highest stage, the essential suffering
 comprised in the "five clinging aggregates" (pañcupadanakkhandha), represents
 the climax of understanding, this realization comes as the fruit of a long
 period of preparation grounded upon the first flash of insight into the
 basic inadequacy of the human condition.
 Such an insight usually dawns through particular experiences typical of
 the first two stages of suffering — through sudden pain, loss or disappointment
, or through chronic anxiety, confusion, and distress.
 But in order to become the stimulus to a higher course of development,
 our vision must be capable of rising from the particular to the universal.
 It is only when we see clearly for ourselves that we are "sunk in birth,
 aging, and death, in sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, sunk
 in suffering, overcome by suffering" (MN 29), that we are really ready
 for the means to bring this unsatisfactory condition to an end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since it is suffering that impels us to seek the way to liberation, suffering
 is called the supporting condition for faith.
 By itself, however, the confrontation with suffering even at the level
 of mature reflection is not sufficient to generate faith.
 For faith to arise two conditions are required: the first is the awareness
 of suffering, which makes us recognize the need for a liberative path;
 the second is the encounter with a teaching that proclaims a liberative
 path.
 Thence the Buddha says that faith has for its nutriment hearing the exposition
 of the true Dhamma.11Saddha, the faith that comes into being as a result
 of hearing the exposition of the true Dhamma, is essentially an attitude
 of trust and commitment directed to ultimate emancipation.
 In order for such faith to arise and become a driving force of spiritual
 development, it must meet with an objective ground capable of eliciting
 its forward leap into the unknown and of prompting its inner urge towards
 liberation.
 From the Buddhist perspective this objective ground is provided by the
 three objects of refuge — the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, that
 is, the enlightened Teacher, his teaching, and his community of noble disciples.
 The faith to be placed in them must not be blind and uncritical.
 Though initially requiring consent born out of trust, it also must be based
 on critical scrutiny — the Teacher tested to determine his trustworthiness,
 his doctrine examined to decide on its cogency, and his disciples interrogated
 to ascertain their reliability.12 As a result of such examination, conducted
 either through personal confrontation whenever possible or through scrutiny
 of the scriptural records, faith becomes settled in the Buddha as the Perfectly
 Enlightened One, the unerring guide on the path to deliverance; in the
 Dhamma as his teaching and the path leading to deliverance; and in the
 Sangha as the community of the Buddha's disciples who have verified his
 teaching through their own direct experience, and hence may be relied upon
 for guidance in our own pursuit of the goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the first requisite of spiritual development, faith is compared to a
 hand in that it is needed to take hold of beneficial practices, and to
 a seed in that it is the vitalizing germ for the growth of the higher virtues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beneath its seeming simplicity it is a complex phenomenon combining intellectual
, emotional, and conative elements.
 Intellectually faith implies a willingness to accept on trust propositions
 beyond our present capacity for verification, propositions relating to
 the basic tenets of the doctrine.
 Through practice this assent will be translated from belief into knowledge,
 but at the outset there is required an acceptance which cannot be fully
 corroborated by objective evidence.
 Emotionally faith issues in feelings of confidence and serene joy, coupled
 with an attitude of devotion directed to the objects of refuge.
 And at the level of volition faith reinforces the readiness to implement
 certain lines of conduct in the conviction they will lead to the desired
 goal.
 It is the mobilizing force of action, stirring up the energy to actualize
 the ideal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Joy (Pamojja)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Faith is the supporting condition for joy": Faith functions as a support
 for the next link in the series, joy or gladness (pamojja), by permitting
 an outlet from the pent-up tensions of an existential impasse brought on
 by the reflective encounter with the problem of suffering.
 Prior to the discovery of the true Dhamma two alternatives present themselves
 to the thoughtful individual as he struggles to work out a viable solution
 to the problem of suffering once it has emerged into the open in its full
 depth and universality.
 One alternative is compliant submission to a justification of suffering
 developed along traditional theological lines — that is, a theodicy which
 sees evil and suffering as detracting from the goodness of the created
 order only superficially, while ultimately contributing to the total perfection
 of the whole.
 This solution, though generally aligned with the higher ethical values,
 still appears to the sensitive thinker to be a facile answer constantly
 provocative of a gnawing sense of doubt and disbelief.
 The other alternative is resignation to suffering as a brute fact unintelligibl
e to man's moral sense, an incidental offshoot of a universe totally indifferent
 to any structure of spiritual or ethical values.
 This solution, though not internally inconsistent, clashes with our basic
 moral intuitions so sharply that the result, for the sensitive thinker,
 is often a turn to nihilism in one of its two forms — as reckless license
 or ineffectual despair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither the theological nor the materialistic answers can show the way to
 an actual escape from suffering.
 Both, in the last analysis, can only hold out a choice between resignation
 and rebellion.
 The gain of faith in the true Dhamma spells the end to this quandary by
 pointing to a solution which can admit the pervasive reality of suffering
 without needing to justify it, yet can give this suffering a cogent explanation
 and indicate an escape.
 Suffering, from this perspective, is traceable to distinct causes endowed
 with ethical significance; it is the inevitable result of our own immoral
 actions returning to ourselves.
 Our actions, when viewed from the standpoint of the Dhamma, are neither
 threads in some invisible handiwork of divine perfection, nor meaningless
 pulsations of nerves and brain, but expressions of ethically significant
 decisions having an integral place in a morally intelligible world.
 They are seen as choices for which we bear full responsibility before an
 impersonal universal law that ensures the preservation of an equilibrium
 between deeds and their results, so that virtuous deeds bring forth happiness
 and evil deeds suffering.
 The round of becoming in which we are immersed — where we are born, grow
 old, suffer, and die — this round is created by ourselves, fashioned out
 of our own blindness and craving.
 We build the round ourselves and we can bring it to an end by ourselves,
 by eradicating this world-sustaining ignorance and desire.
 The path to liberation is revealed in all its practical details with full
 precision and clarity.
 It is a path of conduct and insight each man must tread for himself, success
 being dependent entirely on his own diligence, sincerity and energy, and
 on his capacities for renunciation and understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gain of faith in the true Dhamma thus points to an outlet from the contentio
n of opposed alternatives, neither of which can be happily embraced.
 It exhausts the pressures of an apparent dead-end, and as the stress and
 tension fall away there springs up a surge of joy conditioned by the acquisitio
n of faith.
 This incipient swell of joy grows by degrees as the aspirant's contemplation
 focuses more sharply upon the objects in which confidence has been reposed.
 Sustained reflection on the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha gradually dispels
 the darkness of doubt and indecision.
 It issues in an effusion of light, of peace and inner clarity, when as
 a result of such reflection the defilements are attenuated and the mind's
 impulsion towards the elevating qualities the refuges represent gains in
 forward momentum.
 For this reason faith is compared to a miraculous water-clearing gem.
 According to Indian legend, there is a special gem possessed by the mythic
 universal monarch which, when thrown into a stream of turbid water, immediately
 causes it to become clear.
 The strands of vegetation float away, the mud settles, and the water becomes
 pure, serene, and sweet-tasting, fit to be drunk by the monarch.
 Similarly, it is said, when the gem of faith is set up in the heart it
 causes the hindrances to disappear, the defilements to settle, and the
 mind to become clear, lucid, and serene.13
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strengthening of confidence in the objects of refuge becomes the incentive
 for a firmer dedication to the practice of the teaching.
 Thence the texts ascribe to faith the characteristic of "leaping forward."14
 Faith leaps forward in that "when the yogin sees that the hearts of others
 have been set free, he leaps forward, by way of aspiration, to the various
 fruits of a holy life, and he makes efforts to attain the yet unattained,
 to find the unfound, to realize the unrealized."15 This aspect of faith
 is illustrated by a courageous hero who lunges across a turbulent river
 to escape from danger, saving himself thereby and inspiring others by his
 example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this stage, in particular, the aspirant's faith creates a readiness to
 undertake the basic rules of moral training.
 Through his settled faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha he is prepared
 to enter the path of practice, which requires at the start that he train
 in the foundation of the path, the observance of moral discipline (Sila).
 For this reason the acceptance of moral restraint is said to be undertaken
 out of faith.16 Moral restraint is taken up by accepting rules of discipline
 designed to inculcate an inner disposition of virtue by controlling bodily
 and verbal actions.
 The codes of rules vary in scope from the five basic precepts of the Buddhist
 layman to the more than 227 training rules undertaken by the bhikkhu or
 fully ordained monk, but all share the common characteristic of disciplining
 behavior.
 Each of the basic precepts involves an explicit principle of abstinence
 requiring to be observed and an implicit mental attitude to be cultivated
 through such abstinence.
 The former consists in abstention from the unwholesome actions of taking
 life, stealing, sexual abuse, false speech and partaking of intoxicants;
 the latter calls for a persistent effort to develop a mind of compassion,
 honesty, purity, truthfulness, and sobriety.
 The immediate result of living in conformity with these guidelines to right
 action is the arising of a sense of freedom from remorse (avippatisara).
 Remorse, a feeling of regret over moral transgression and neglect, tends
 to provoke guilt, agitation, and self-recrimination.
 When, through close adherence to the precepts, the mind is freed from remorse,
 an ease of conscience and "bliss of blamelessness" set in born of the knowledge
 that one's actions are beyond reproach.
 Thence the Buddha declares wholesome rules of conduct to have freedom from
 remorse as their benefit and reward.17 The joy that comes through realizing
 one's purity confirms the confidence originally placed in the teaching.
 Thereby it arouses still stronger faith and a desire for further application
 to the practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rapture (Piti)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Joy is the supporting condition for rapture": Though for certain individuals
 serene faith in the objects of refuge and a clear conscience are sufficient
 to transform joy into rapture, such cases are the exception rather than
 the rule.
 Generally, in order for the emotional tone of the spiritual life to be
 lifted to that pitch of intensity suggested by the term "rapture" (piti)
 a further commitment to the training is necessary.
 This commitment takes the form of deliberate application to the practice
 of meditation.
 Methods of meditation contributing to the attainment of liberation are
 classified into two systems — serenity meditation (samathabhavana) and
 insight meditation (vipassanabhavana).
 Serenity meditation aims at the creation of a state of calm concentration
 by unifying the mind in focus on a single object.
 Insight meditation aims at insight into the nature of phenomena by directly
 contemplating the bodily and mental processes as they occur on the successive
 moments of experience.
 Though there is a system which employs mindfulness as a direct means to
 the awakening of insight, in the usual pattern serenity is cultivated first
 as a preliminary measure, since the unification and purification of consciousne
ss effected by concentration facilitate correct penetration of the nature
 of things through contemplative insight.
 This is the sequence utilized by the present sutta, the stages from "rapture"
 through "concentration" covering the systematic development of serenity,
 the two following stages the development of insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serenity meditation is cultivated on the basis of a single object selected
 from a standard set of objects reserved exclusively for the development
 of concentration.
 These objects, traditionally numbered at forty, include the colored and
 elemental circles called kasinas, the cemetery contemplations, the recollection
s of the three refuge objects, meditation on the sublime abodes of love
 and compassion, mindfulness of breathing, etc.
 After taking up one of these objects as his field of work, the yogin strives
 to unify his mind by fixing his attention on his object to the exclusion
 of all sense data, concepts, thoughts, memories, projections, fantasies,
 and associative thinking.
 His aim is to make his mind one-pointed, and this forbids at once its dispersal
 among a multiplicity of concerns.
 Success in the practice depends on the harmonization of the mental faculties
 in the work of concentration.
 Through mindfulness (sati) the yogin bears the object in his field of awareness
 and prevents it from slipping away; through discernment (sampajañña) he
 maintains a cautious watch upon the mind, noting its tendencies to stray
 and swiftly correcting them; and through energy (viriya) he strives to
 dispel the impediments to mental unification, and to maintain his awareness
 at a pitch which is simultaneously taut but relaxed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impediments to meditation are classified into a group of five factors
 called the "five hindrances" (pañcanivarana).
 These are sensual desire, ill-will, stiffness and torpor, restlessness
 and regret, and doubt.
 The Buddha calls these five hindrances "corruptions of the mind" and "weakeners
 of wisdom." He says they are conducive to pain, blindness, and ignorance,
 and compares them respectively to a debt, a disease, imprisonment, slavery,
 and the dangers of a desert journey.
 Their removal by unremitting exertion is the first task facing the meditator.
 As he proceeds in his practice, striving with patience and diligence, there
 come suddenly momentary breaks in the course of his efforts when the hindrances
 fall away, the flow of inner verbalization stops, and the mind abides one-point
edly on the object.
 The achievement of this momentary concentration, brief as it is, gives
 immense satisfaction.
 It is a powerful experience unleashing spurts of mental energy which flood
 up to the surface of consciousness and inundate the mind with waves of
 joyous refreshment.
 It brings an elating thrill bordering on ecstasy, crowning the yogin's
 previous endeavors and inspiring further effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experience marks the arising of rapture.
 The distinguishing feature of rapture is a strong interest and delight
 directed to the object of attention.
 Its function is to give refreshment to the body and mind.
 It can assume both wholesome and unwholesome forms, depending on whether
 it is motivated by attachment or detachment with respect to its object,
 but on occasions of meditative consciousness it is always wholesome.
 The commentaries distinguish five degrees of rapture which make their appearanc
e in the successive stages of mental unification.18 "Minor rapture," the
 lowest on the scale, is said to be able to raise the hairs of the body.
 "Momentary rapture," the next degree of development, rushes through the
 body with an intensity likened to streaks of lightning flashing forth in
 the sky at different moments.
 "Showering rapture," the third degree, breaks over the body again and again
 with considerable force, like the waves on the seashore breaking upon the
 beach.
 "Uplifting rapture" is so-called because it is credited with the ability
 to cause the body to levitate, and the Visuddhimagga cites several cases
 where this literally occurs.
 And "pervading rapture," the highest on the scale, is said to completely
 fill the whole body as a huge inundation fills a rock cavern.
 Since the commentary to our sutta defines joy (pamojja), the prior link
 in our sequence, as weak rapture, we may assume this to signify the delightful
 interest preceding the deliberate development of meditation, that is, in
 the stages when faith in the Dhamma was just acquired and the purification
 of moral discipline commenced.
 The five degrees of rapture presented here would then pertain exclusively
 to the rapture found in meditative consciousness.
 And since the last degree of rapture only gains ascendancy with the attainment
 of full absorption, which does not come until later, it seems that the
 degrees of rapture which are distinctive of the present stage of progress
 are the four beginning with minor rapture and reaching their peak with
 uplifting rapture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tranquillity (Passaddhi)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Rapture is the supporting condition for tranquillity": While the appearance
 of rapture indicates a definite advance in the work of concentration, its
 coarser modes still contain an element of exuberance which is in constant
 danger of slipping out of control and spilling over into unwholesome states
 of mind dominated by restlessness and agitation.
 For rapture involves an intense delight in the object coupled with an anticipat
ion of even greater delight to come.
 The experience of present delight can often be accompanied by an underlying
 worry that this pleasure will disappear, while the expectation of further
 delight can stimulate a subtle grasping at the future.
 Both states, the anxiety and the grasping, bring along an excitation inimical
 to the centering of the mind in one-pointed calm.
 For this reason, as the yogin progresses in his practice a point is reached
 where the ecstatic exultation sparked off by rapture becomes felt as an
 obstruction to the development of mental unification, a corruption of the
 training which must be pacified and stilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rapture itself will remain as a factor of meditative development up to the
 third absorption, but to permit further progress its detrimental tendencies
 have to be sublimated.
 Through continued application to the practice rapture becomes more refined,
 shedding the heated zest of its initial forms.
 With its refinement it increasingly evokes along with itself another quality
 called "tranquillity" (passaddhi).
 Tranquillity is characterized by the quieting down of mental disturbances.
 It removes agitation and restlessness, imparting to the mind a soothing
 calm comparable to the cool shade offered by a tree to travelers oppressed
 by the sun's heat.
 Tranquillity operates in two co-occurrent forms, "tranquillity of body"
 and "tranquillity of mind," where "mind" signifies the aggregate of consciousne
ss and "body," not the physical organism, but the group of consciousness-adjunct
s included in the aggregates of feeling, perception, and mental formations.19
 Thence the arising of tranquillity results in the subsiding of disturbances
 throughout the full extent of the psychodynamic system.
 It allays the propensity towards excitement, soothes the innervations brought
 on by rapture, and casts over the meditative endeavor a profound stillness
 paving the way for deeper states of concentration to follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tranquillity further induces in both consciousness and its adjuncts the
 qualitative factors of lightness, malleability, wieldiness, proficiency,
 and rectitude.
 These factors, present to some extent in every wholesome state of consciousness
, perform the respective tasks of eliminating sluggishness, rigidity, unwieldine
ss, disability, and insincerity.
 By holding at bay these mental corruptions destructive to moral and spiritual
 progress, they enhance the functional efficiency of the mind, rendering
 it a more tractable instrument for application to the higher stages of
 the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Happiness (Sukha)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Tranquillity is the supporting condition for happiness": As the yogin's
 psychosomatic system is brought to a state of tranquil composure, a feeling
 of inner happiness or bliss (sukha), unobtrusively present from the start,
 gains in prominence until it emerges in its own right as a salient feature
 of the training.
 Though closely associated with rapture, happiness is not identical with
 the latter and can arise in its absence.
 Rapture denotes a mental factor belonging to the fourth of the five aggregates
 into which Buddhism classifies the psycho-physical organism, namely, the
 aggregate of mental formations (sankharakkhandha).
 It is a conative rather than affective phenomenon, which fuses zestful
 interest with a sense of joyous delight.
 Happiness, on the other hand, is a purely hedonic factor belonging to the
 second aggregate, the aggregate of feelings (vedanakkhandha).
 It is pleasurable feeling, here, as the happiness conditioned by tranquillity,
 the pleasure which springs up in meditation as disturbances subside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rapture is relatively coarse in quality and happiness subtle.
 Thence, though rapture is always accompanied by happiness, in the higher
 meditative attainment of the third jhana happiness can remain even after
 rapture has faded away.
 The Atthasalini, a commentary to the Abhidhamma-pitaka, illustrates the
 difference between them with a vivid simile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A man who, traveling along the path through a great desert and overcome
 by the heat is thirsty and desirous of drink, if he saw a man on the way,
 would ask, "Where is water?" The other would say, "Beyond the wood is a
 dense forest with a natural lake.
 Go there, and you will get some." He hearing these words would be glad and
 delighted.
 Going onwards, be would see men with wet clothes and hair, hear the sound
 of wild fowl and pea-fowl, etc., see the dense forest of green like a net
 of jewels by the edge of the natural lake, he would see the water lily,
 the lotus, the white lily, etc., growing in the lake, he would see the clear
 transparent water, he would be all the more glad and delighted, would descend
 into the natural lake, bathe and drink at pleasure and, his oppression
 being allayed, he would eat the fibers and stalks of the lilies, adorn
 himself with the blue lotus, carry on his shoulders the roots of the mandalaka,
 ascend from the lake, put on his clothes, dry the bathing cloth in the
 sun, and in the cool shade where the breeze blew ever so gently lay himself
 down and say: "O bliss! O bliss!" Thus should this illustration be applied:
 — The time of gladness and delight from when he heard of the natural lake
 and the dense forest till he saw the water is like piti having the manner
 of gladness and delight at the object in view.
 The time when, after his bath and drink be laid himself down in the cool
 shade, saying, "O bliss! O bliss!" etc., is the sense of sukha grown strong,
 established in that mode of enjoying the taste of the object.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the simile's suggestion, rapture and happiness are not necessarily
 asynchronous, and are in fact only sundered with the attainment of the
 third jhana.
 The presentation of happiness as arising subsequent to rapture only means
 that happiness becomes the salient feature of the path after rapture has
 already made its own distinctive contribution and settled back to a subsidiary
 place.
 In the present stage rapture still persists, only its exuberance has now
 been toned down by the prevailing quiescence developed in the stage of
 tranquillity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subcommentary to the Upanisa Sutta explains sukha as the happiness of
 the access to absorption.
 The term "access" (upacara) denotes the stage in the cultivation of serenity
 immediately preceding full absorption, the intended goal of serenity meditation.
 Access is characterized by the abandonment of the five hindrances and the
 arising of the "counterpart sign," the self-luminous object of interior
 perception which is the focal point for the higher stages of concentration.
 The abandoning of the hindrances began already with the gain of faith,
 which conferred a serene lucency suspending their turbulence, and each
 ascending rung along the path marked their attenuation to a further degree.
 Since the hindrances are the principal obstructions to both serenity and
 insight, the early stages of the path are primarily concerned with their
 debilitation and elimination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elimination of the hindrances prior to attaining access is brought about
 by means of two methods, one specifically directed to each hindrance separately
, the other applicable to all at once.
 The former is to be employed when a particular hindrance obtrudes itself
 with persistent force, the latter on other occasions when no one hindrance
 seems especially conspicuous.
 The specific method involves the reversing of the causal situation out
 of which the hindrance develops.
 Since each defiling factor is a conditioned phenomenon coming into existence
 through distinct causes, the key to its elimination lies in applying the
 appropriate antidote to its causal base.
 Thus sensual desire arises on account of unskillful attention to the attractive
 features of things, to alluring objects and physical bodies.
 It is attenuated by considering the impermanence of the objects of attachment,
 and by reflecting on the repulsive nature underlying the attractive appearance
 of the bodies which arouse desire.
 Ill-will or anger also springs up from unskillful attention, in this case
 to the unpleasant aspects of persons and things; it is reversed by developing
 loving kindness towards disagreeable people and patience in the face of
 unfavorable circumstances.
 Stiffness and torpor become prominent by submitting to moods of sloth and
 drowsiness; they are dispelled by the arousal of energy.
 Restlessness and regret arise from attending to disturbing thoughts and
 are eliminated by directing the mind to an object conducive to inner peace.
 And doubt, grounded upon unclarity with regard to fundamental points of
 doctrine, is dispelled by clear thinking and precise analysis of the issues
 shrouded in obscurity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to these techniques, which counter the hindrances separately,
 the practice of concentration on one of the prescribed objects of serenity
 meditation inhibits them all simultaneously.
 Though only affective so long as no particular hindrance impedes the meditative
 progress, this method, drawing upon the power of mental unification, is
 capable of bringing tremendous force to bear upon the struggle against
 their supremacy.
 Since the latent defilements can crop up into the open only so long as
 the mind is driven by discursive thinking, the unification of the mind
 upon a single object closes off the portal through which they emerge.
 As the mind descends to increasingly deeper levels of concentration, the
 hindrances are gradually made to subside until, with the attainment of
 access, their suppression becomes complete.
 Held at bay in the base of the mental continuum, the latent defilements
 are no longer capable of rising to the surface of consciousness.
 For as long as the suppressive force of concentration prevails, their activity
 is suspended, and the mind remains secure in its one-pointed stabilization,
 safe from their disruptive influence.
 This abandonment of the hindrances through the power of suppression brings
 a feeling of profound relief accompanied by a blissful effusion born from
 the newly accomplished purification.
 The Buddha compares the happiness of abandoning the hindrances to the happiness
 a man would experience if he were unexpectedly freed from debt, cured of
 a serious illness, released from prison, set free from slavery, or led
 to safety at the end of a desert journey.20
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concentration (Samadhi)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Happiness is the supporting condition for concentration": The attainment
 of access signals a major breakthrough which spurs on further exertion.
 As a result of such exertion the bliss generated in the access stage is
 made to expand and to suffuse the mind so completely that the subtlest
 barriers to inner unification disappear.
 Along with their disappearance the mind passes beyond the stage of access
 and enters into absorption or full concentration (samadhi).
 Concentration itself denotes a mental factor present in both the attainments
 of access and absorption.
 Its salient feature is the wholesome unification of the mind on a single
 object, and it brings about a harmonization between consciousness and its
 concomitants to a degree sufficient to free them from the distraction,
 vacillation, and unsteadiness characterizing their normal operations.
 The mind in concentration, fixed firmly on its object, is like the flame
 of a candle shielded from the wind or the surface of a lake on which all
 the waves and ripples have been stilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, although both access and absorption partake of the nature of concentrat
ion, an important difference still separates them, justifying the restriction
 of the term "full concentration" to absorption alone.
 This difference consists in the relative strength in the two attainments
 of certain mental concomitants called the "factors of absorption" or "jhana
 factors" (jhanangani) — namely, applied thought, sustained thought, rapture,
 happiness, and mental one-pointedness.
 These factors, aroused at the very beginning of serenity meditation and
 gradually cultivated through the course of its progress, have the dual
 function of inhibiting the hindrances and unifying the mind on its object.
 According to the commentaries, the factors are aligned with the hindrances
 in a direct one-to-one relation of opposition, such that each jhana factor
 has the specific task of countering and occluding one hindrance.
 Thus applied thought counteracts stiffness and torpor, sustained thought
 doubt, rapture ill-will, happiness restlessness and regret, and one-pointedness
 sensual desire.21 At the same time the factors exercise a consolidating
 function with respect to the object, applied thought directing the mind
 to the object, sustained thought anchoring it there, rapture creating an
 interest in it, happiness experiencing its affective quality, and one-pointedne
ss focusing the mind on the object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the access attainment the jhana factors are strong enough to keep the
 hindrances suppressed, but not yet strong enough to place the mind in absorptio
n.
 They still stand in need of maturation.
 Maturation comes as a result of continued practice, which gives them the
 power to lift the mind beyond the threshold plane of access and plunge
 it into the object with the unshakable force of full absorption.
 In the state of absorption the mind fixes upon its object with such a high
 intensity of concentration that subjective discriminations between the
 two no longer occur.
 The waves of discursive thinking have at last subsided, and the mind abides
 without straying even the least from its base of stabilization.
 Nevertheless, even full concentration admits of degrees.
 At the plane of absorption concentration is divided into four levels called
 the four jhanas.
 These are distinguished by the aggregation of factors present in each attainmen
t, the order of the four being determined by the successive elimination
 of the comparatively coarser factors.
 In the first jhana all five jhana factors are present; in the second applied
 and sustained thought are eliminated, in the third rapture is made to fade
 away; and in the fourth the feeling of happiness is replaced by equanimity,
 the peaceful feeling-tone which veers neither toward pleasure nor toward
 pain.
 One-pointedness remains present in all four jhanas, the one constant in
 the series.
 To rise from the first jhana to the second, the yogin, after emerging from
 the first jhana, must reflect upon the coarseness of applied and sustained
 thought and the first jhana's inadequacy due to the proximity of the hindrances.
 Then he must consider the second jhana as more peaceful and sublime, arouse
 the aspiration to attain it, and exert his energy to achieve a stronger
 degree of mental unification.
 Similarly, to rise from the second to the third jhana he must repeat the
 same procedure taking rapture as the coarse factor needing to be eliminated,
 and to rise from the third to the fourth jhana he must reflect on the coarsenes
s of happiness and the superiority of neutral, equanimous feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond the fourth jhana lie four even subtler stages of concentration called
 the four formless attainments (arupasamapatti).
 In these attainments the luminous counterpart sign serving as the object
 of the jhanas is replaced by four successively more refined formless objects,
 which give their names to their respective attainments — the base of infinite
 space, the base of infinite consciousness, the base of nothingness, and
 the base of neither perception nor non-perception.
 At the peak of this scale of meditative equipoise consciousness arrives
 at a point of unification so fine that, like the geometric point, it eludes
 detection, and its presence can be neither affirmed nor denied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge and Vision (Ñana dassana)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Concentration is the supporting condition for the knowledge and vision
 of things as they really are": Despite the loftiness and sublimity of these
 exalted attainments, immersion in deep concentration is not the end of
 the Buddhist path.
 The unification of consciousness effected by serenity meditation is only
 a means to a further stage of practice.
 This stage, ushered in by the next link in the series, "the knowledge and
 vision of things as they really are" (yathabhuta-ñanadassana), is the developme
nt of insight (vipassana bhavana).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through his deep concentration the yogin is able to suppress the defilements,
 to bring them to a state of quiescence where they no longer invade the
 active processes of thought.
 But beneath the surface stillness the defilements lie latent, ready to
 spring up again if provoked.
 As long as the defilements remain present, even if only in dormant form,
 release from suffering has yet to be achieved, for the latencies of the
 defilements lying quietly in the mental continuum can still regenerate
 the samsaric round of continued birth and death.
 The latent tendencies are the seeds of renewed existence, which bring about
 a re-arising of the stream of consciousness and thence of all the remaining
 links in the samsaric chain.
 To end the round and attain deliverance the defilements must be completely
 destroyed; it is not enough merely to suppress them.
 The destruction of the defilements cannot be brought about by concentration
 alone, for concentration, even at its deepest levels, can only effect the
 suspension of their activity, not their eradication.
 To destroy the defilements down to their bottommost stratum of latency
 something more is needed — pañña, the wisdom which penetrates the true
 mark of phenomena.
 Concentration gains its place in the Buddhist discipline in so far as it
 induces the mental one-pointedness of at least the access level required
 as the support for wisdom.
 Thus the Buddha enjoins his disciples to develop concentration, not as
 an end in itself, but because "one who is concentrated understands things
 as they really are."22 Only a mind which has been rendered pure and calm
 can comprehend things in accordance with actuality, and the discipline
 of concentration, by suppressing the hindrances, engenders the required
 purity and calm.
 The actual work, however, of extricating the defilements is performed exclusive
ly by wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wisdom is "the one thing needed" to cut off the defilements because the
 most fundamental of all the mental depravities is ignorance (avijja).
 Ignorance is the kingpost upon which all the other defilements converge
 and the lynchpin which holds them all in place.
 While it remains the others remain, and for the others to be destroyed
 it must be destroyed.
 Doctrinally defined as nescience with regard to the four noble truths,
 ignorance signifies not so much the lack of specific pieces of information
 as a basic non-comprehension regarding the true nature of things as expressed
 in the four truths.
 Since the eradication of the defilements depends upon the eradication of
 ignorance, the one factor capable of abolishing the defilements is the
 factor capable of abolishing their fundamental root, and that is the direct
 antithesis of ignorance — wisdom or "the knowledge and vision of things
 as they really are." For this reason, at the beginning of our sutta, the
 Buddha proclaims: "The destruction of the cankers is for one who knows
 and sees, I say, not for one who does not know and does not see." The defilement
s, epitomized in the "cankers," are only destroyed for one who overcomes
 ignorance by the wisdom which knows and sees things as they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compound expression "knowledge and vision," indicates that the kind
 of knowledge to be developed is not mere conceptual understanding, but
 knowledge which in its directness and immediacy is akin to visual perception
 .
 Conceptual understanding is often needed to clear away the intellectual
 obstructions to a correct perspective, but it must eventually yield to
 the light of direct experience.
 To achieve this experiential understanding it is necessary to enter upon
 the practice of the second system of Buddhist meditation, the development
 of insight.
 The practice of insight meditation aims at dislodging the defilements by
 eradicating the ignorance at their base.
 Ignorance is overcome by generating, through mindful observation, a direct
 insight into things as they really are.
 The material upon which insight works is precisely the sphere where ignorance
 is concealed, our own psycho-physical experience.
 Its method is the application of mindfulness or discerning awareness to
 this sphere without interruption and in all activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the discourse the Buddha states that what must be known and seen as they
 are is the five aggregates — their nature, their arising, and their passing
 away.
 The five aggregates — material form, feeling, perception, mental formations,
 and consciousness — are the basic categories structuring the Buddha's analysis
 of experience.
 Each experiential occasion, from the Buddhist perspective, is a complex
 process involving a number of factors functioning in unison.
 To normal, non-analytical consciousness this unified complex appears as
 a uniform mass, a false appearance which, when accepted at face value,
 leads to the assumption of a simple solid self as the permanent subject
 of cognition.
 The assumption of permanent selfhood Buddhism holds to be the basic conceptual
 error dominating our mental horizon.
 It is the outermost shell of egoistic projection shielding the pre-conceptual
 ignorance, and thus the first of the ten fetters to be broken along the
 path to liberation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To dispel the illusion of independent selfhood the experiential process
 must be submitted to searching scrutiny which rectifies the false perceptions
 contributing to its formation.
 The first phase in this examination is the dissection of the cognitive
 fabric into the distinct threads entering into its make-up.
 These "threads" or components are the five aggregates.
 The aggregate of material form covers the physical side of experience,
 comprising both external material objects and the body together with its
 sense faculties.
 The other four aggregates constitute the mental side of experience.
 Feeling is the affective quality of pleasure or pain, or the neutral tone
 of neither pleasure nor pain, present on any occasion of mental activity.
 Perception is the selective faculty, which singles out the object's distinctive
 marks as a basis for recognition.
 The formations aggregate is a comprehensive category incorporating all
 mental factors other than feeling and perception; its most conspicuous
 member is volition.
 And consciousness is the faculty of cognition itself, which sustains and
 coordinates all the other factors in the task of apprehending the object.
 These five aggregates function in complete autonomy, entirely through their
 reciprocal support, without need for a self-subsistent unifying principle
 to be identified as a self or subject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to develop the knowledge and vision of things as they really are
 with respect to the aggregates, the yogin must first emerge from his state
 of deep concentration, for the analytical faculty — silenced in the folds
 of serenity — has to be brought into play to effect the required dissection.
 With his mind made clear and pliant as a result of concentration, the yogin
 attends to the diverse phenomena coming into range of his awareness.
 The phenomena are attended to as they become manifest to determine their
 salient characteristics; then, on this basis, they are assigned to their
 appropriate place among the aggregates.
 Whatever is physical belongs to the aggregate of material form; whatever
 registers affective tone is feeling; whatever notices the object's marks
 is perception; whatever wills is a mental formation; and whatever cognizes
 is consciousness.
 The aggregates may further be grouped into a simpler scheme by placing
 material form on one side and the four mental aggregates on the other,
 the two being coupled as mentality-materiality (nama rupa).
 They are then correlated with their causes and conditions to expose their
 dependently arisen nature.
 The analytic procedure generates the realization that experience is just
 a double stream of material and mental events without a subsisting self.
 The synthetic procedure makes it clear that all these events are conditioned
 phenomena which arise when their conditions are present and cease when
 their conditions disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last realization becomes the portal to the next major stage in the
 development of understanding, the contemplation of rise and fall.
 As the yogin attends to the states that appear, he sees how each undergoes
 the same process of coming into being, altering, and passing away: "Such
 is the arising of material form, feeling, perception, formations, and conscious
ness.
 Such is the passing away of material form, feeling, perception, formations,
 and consciousness." The contemplation of rise and fall brings into focus
 three marks common to all conditioned phenomena — their impermanence, unsatisfa
ctoriness, and selflessness.
 Impermanence is generally the first characteristic to be discerned, as
 it becomes clear through the immediate attention given to rise and fall.
 The perception of impermanence leads directly to insight into the other
 marks, which follow naturally from the first.
 The notion of "happiness," or "pleasure," at the level of philosophical
 understanding rather than mere feeling, hinges upon an implicit notion
 of permanence.
 If something is to be truly a source of happiness it must be permanent.
 What is impermanent is incapable of yielding lasting happiness and security,
 and therefore turns out, under examination, to be really unsatisfactory,
 a potential source of suffering.
 The notion of selfhood in turn rests upon the two pillars of permanence
 and pleasure.
 What is impermanent and unsatisfactory cannot be identified as a self,
 for it lacks any solid unchanging core upon which the notion of selfhood
 can be grounded.
 Thus the impermanent, unsatisfactory phenomena comprised in the five aggregates
 turn out to have a third characteristic, the aspect of selflessness.
 The realization of these three characteristics — impermanence, unsatisfactorine
ss, and selflessness — through unmediated insight is the knowledge and vision
 of things as they really are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Disenchantment (Nibbida)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the supporting
 condition for disenchantment": As the yogin contemplates the rise and fall
 of the five aggregates, his attention becomes riveted to the final phase
 of the process, their dissolution and passing away.
 This insight into the instability of the aggregates at the same time reveals
 their basic unreliability.
 Far from being the ground of satisfaction we unreflectively take them to
 be, conditioned things are seen to be fraught with peril when adhered to
 with craving and wrong views.
 The growing realization of this fundamental insecurity brings a marked
 transformation in the mind's orientation towards conditioned existence.
 Whereas previously the mind was drawn to the world by the lure of promised
 gratification, now, with the exposure of the underlying danger, it draws
 away in the direction of a disengagement.
 This inward turning away from the procession of formations is called nibbida.
 Though some times translated "disgust" or "aversion," the term suggests,
 not emotional repugnance, but a conscious act of detachment resulting from
 a profound noetic discovery.
 Nibbida signifies in short, the serene, dignified withdrawal from phenomena
 which supervenes when the illusion of their permanence, pleasure, and selfhood
 has been shattered by the light of correct knowledge and vision of things
 as they are.
 The commentaries explain nibbida as powerful insight (balava vipassana),
 an explanation consonant with the word's literal meaning of "finding out."
 It indicates the sequel to the discoveries unveiled by that contemplative
 process, the mind's appropriate response to the realizations thrust upon
 it by the growing experiences of insight.
 Buddhaghosa compares it to the revulsion a man would feel who, having grabbed
 bold of a snake in the belief it was a fish, would look at it closely and
 suddenly realize he was holding a snake.23
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As our rendering implies, disenchantment marks the dissipation of an "enchantmen
t" or fascination with the kaleidoscopic pleasures of conditioned existence,
 whether in the form of sense enjoyments, emotions, or ideas.
 This fascination, resting upon the distorted apprehension of things as
 permanent, pleasurable, and self, is maintained at a deep unverbalized
 level by the hope of finding self identity in the conditioned.
 As the enchanted mind presses forward seeking explicit confirmation of
 the innate sense of selfhood, everything encountered is evaluated in terms
 of the notions "mine," "I," and "my self," the principal appropriative
 and identificatory devices with which the inherent sense of personal selfhood
 works.
 These three notions, imputed to phenomena on account of ignorance, are
 in actuality conceptual fabrications woven by craving, conceit, and speculation
, respectively.
 The insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness cuts
 the ground out from underneath this threefold fabrication, reversing the
 mode in which phenomena can be viewed.
 Whereas before the development of insight the aggregates were regarded
 as being "mine," "I," and "self," now, when illuminated with the light
 of insight knowledge, they are seen in the opposite way as "not-mine,"
 "not I," and "not self." Since the fascination with phenomenal existence
 is sustained by the assumption of underlying selfhood, the dispelling of
 this illusion through the penetration of the three marks brings about a
 de-identification with the aggregates and an end to their spell of enchantment.
 In place of the fascination and attraction a profound experience of estrangemen
t sets in, engendered by the perception of selfessness in all conditioned
 being.
 The suttas present this sequence thus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Material form, monks, is impermanent, suffering, and non-self.
 Feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness are impermanent,
 suffering, and not-self.
 What is impermanent, suffering and non-self, that should be seen with correct
 wisdom as it really is: "This is not mine, this am I not, this is not my
 self." So seeing, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with
 material form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception,
 disenchanted with mental formations, and disenchanted with consciousness.

\begin_layout Standard
Dispassion (Viraga)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Disenchantment is the supporting condition for dispassion": In the trail
 of disenchantment there arises a deep yearning for deliverance from the
 round of samsaric becoming.
 Previously, prior to the arrival at correct knowledge and vision, the mind
 moved freely under the control of the impulses of delight and attachment.
 But now, with the growth of insight and the consequent disenchantment with
 conditioned existence, these impulses yield to a strong detachment and
 evolving capacity for renunciation.
 Whatever tends to provoke grasping and adherence is immediately abandoned,
 whatever tends to create new involvement is left behind.
 The old urges towards outer extension and accumulation give way to a new
 urge towards relinquishment as the one clearly perceived way to release.
 Every motion of the will becomes subordinated to the newly ascendant desire
 for liberation: "Just as a fish in a net, a frog in a snake's jaws, a jungle
 fowl shut into a cage,...
 — just as these are desirous of being delivered, of finding an escape from
 these things, so too this meditator's mind is desirous of being delivered
 from the whole field of formations and escaping from it."24
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The desire for deliverance leads to a quickening of insight.
 The capacity for comprehension picks up new speed, depth, and precision.
 Like a sword the mind of insight-wisdom cuts through the net of illusions
 fabricated on account of ignorance; like a light it illuminates phenomena
 exactly as they are.
 As the power of insight mounts, driven by the longing for liberation, a
 point is eventually reached where a fundamental turn-about takes place
 in the seat of consciousness, effecting a radical restructuring of the
 mental life.
 The beam-like radiance of insight expands into the full luminosity of enlighten
ment, and the mind descends upon the supramundane path leading directly
 and irreversibly to final deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This transformation, signified by viraga or dispassion, is the first strictly
 supramundane (lokuttara) stage in the progression of transcendental dependent
 arising.
 The earlier links in the sequence leading up to dispassion are all technically
 classified as mundane (lokiya).
 Though loosely called "transcendental" in the sense that they are directed
 to the unconditioned, they are still mundane in terms of their scope since
 they operate entirely within range of the conditioned world.
 Their objects of concern are still the five aggregates, or things derivative
 upon them.
 But with the attainment of dispassion consciousness passes clear beyond
 the mundane level, and for a fleeting moment realizes as its object the
 unconditioned state, nibbana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shift in standpoint comes about as the immediate consequence of the
 preceding stages of development.
 Through insight into the three marks the basic distortions covering over
 the true nature of phenomena were exposed; with the uncovering of their
 true nature there set in a disengagement from phenomena.
 This disengagement led to an attitude of relinquishment and a fading out
 of desire.
 Now, having released its grip on the conditioned, the mind turns to the
 unconditioned, the deathless element (amata dhatu), focusing upon it as
 the only state fully adequate to itself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever is there of material form, feeling, perception, mental formations,
 and consciousness — he beholds these phenomena as impermanent, suffering,
 as a disease, a boil, a dart, a misfortune, an affliction, as alien, as
 decomposing, as empty, as selfless.
 He turns his mind away from these phenomena; and when he has turned his
 mind away from them, he focuses his mind on the deathless element, thinking:
 "This is the peaceful, this is the sublime, that is, the stilling of all
 formations, the relinquishing of the foundations, the destruction of craving,
 dispassion, cessation, nibbana."25
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though the realization of the unconditioned requires a turning away from
 the conditioned, it must be emphasized that this realization is achieved
 precisely through the understanding of the conditioned.
 Nibbana cannot be reached by backing off from a direct confrontation with
 samsara to lose oneself in a blissful oblivion to the world.
 The path to liberation is a path of understanding, of comprehension and
 transcendence, not of escapism or emotional self-indulgence.
 Nibbana can only be attained by turning one's gaze towards samsara, and
 scrutinizing it in all its starkness.
 This principle — that the understanding of the conditioned is the way to
 the unconditioned — holds true not only in the general sense that an understand
ing of suffering is the spur to the quest for enlightenment, but in a deeper,
 more philosophical sense as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path to nibbana lies through the understanding of samsara for the reason
 that the experiential realization of the unconditioned emerges from a prior
 penetration of the fundamental nature of the conditioned, without which
 it is impossible.
 The states of mind which realize nibbana are called liberations (vimokkha),
 and these liberations are threefold according to the particular aspect
 of nibbana they fix upon — the signless (animitta), the wishless (appanihita),
 and emptiness (suññata).
 The signless liberation focuses upon nibbana as devoid of the "signs" determina
tive of a conditioned formation, the wishless liberation as free from the
 hankering of desire, and the emptiness liberation as devoid of a self or
 of any kind of substantial identity.
 Now these three liberations are each entered by a distinct gateway or door
 called "the three doors to liberation," (vimokkhamukha).26 These three doors
 signify precisely the contemplations of the three universal marks of the
 conditioned — impermanence, suffering, and selflessness.
 Insight into each mark is a different door leading into the realization
 of the unconditioned.
 The profound contemplation of impermanence is called the door to the signless
 liberation, since comprehension of impermanence strips away the "sign of
 formations" exposing the markless reality of the imperishable to the view
 of the contemplative vision.
 The contemplation of suffering is called the door to the wishless liberation,
 since understanding of the suffering inherent in all formations dries up
 the desire that reaches out for them.
 And deep contemplation of selflessness is called the door to the emptiness
 liberation, since it exposes the voidness of substantial identity in all
 phenomena and hence the unviability of the self-notion in relation to the
 unconditioned.
 In each close the understanding of the conditioned and the realization
 of the unconditioned are found to lock together in direct connection, so
 that by penetrating the conditioned to its very bottom and most universal
 features, the yogin passes through the door leading out of the conditioned
 to the supreme security of the unconditioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The supramundane consciousness that realizes nibbana directly penetrates
 the four noble truths, illuminating them all at once with startling clarity:
 "Just, O monks, as a man in the gloom and darkness of the night, at the
 sudden flashing up of lightning, should with his eyes recognize the objects;
 just so the monk sees, according to reality: 'This is suffering, this is
 the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, this is the
 path leading to the cessation of suffering.'"27 The penetration of the truths
 simultaneously performs four functions, one with respect to each truth.
 It fully understands (parijanati) the first noble truth, the truth of suffering
, since by taking nibbana as its object it acquires a perspective from which
 it can directly see that in contrast to the unconditioned every thing impermane
nt, defiled, and conditioned is marked with suffering.
 It abandons (pajahati) the second noble truth, the truth of the origin,
 since it eradicates the craving and defilements which originate suffering
 so that they can never arise again.
 It realizes (sacchikaroti) the third noble truth, the truth of cessation,
 by apprehending nibbana in which all the suffering of samsara is permanently
 cut off.
 And it develops (bhaveti) the path, the fourth noble truth, since at the
 moment of penetration the eight mental factors comprised in the noble eightfold
 path concurrently arise performing the task of realization.
 Right view sees the unconditioned; right thought directs the mind upon
 it; right speech, right action, and right livelihood eradicate their opposites;
 right effort invigorates the mind; right mindfulness fixes attention on
 the unconditioned, and right concentration unifies the mind in absorption
 on the unconditioned.
 The ancients compare the mind's ability to perform this fourfold function
 to the burning of a lamp.
 Just as a lamp simultaneously burns the wick, dispels the darkness, creates
 light, and uses up the oil, so the supramundane knowledge simultaneously
 understands suffering, abandons craving, realizes nibbana, and develops
 the path.28
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The breakthrough to the unconditioned comes in four distinct stages called
 the four supramundane paths.
 Each momentary path-experience eradicates a determinate group of defilements
 ranked in degrees of coarseness and subtlety, so that the first path eliminates
 the coarsest defilements and the fourth path the most subtle.
 The defilements cut off by the paths are generally classified as ten "fetters"
 (samyojana), receiving this designation because they fetter sentient beings
 to samsara.
 With the first path the yogin eradicates the first three fetters — personality
 view, doubt, and misapprehension of rules and observances.
 Thereby he becomes a "stream-enterer" (sotapanna), one who has entered
 the stream of the Dhamma and is bound for final deliverance in a maximum
 of seven more lives passed in the human or heavenly worlds.
 The second path weakens all the remaining fetters to the point where they
 no longer arise frequently or obsessively, but cuts off none completely;
 with its attainment the yogin advances to the stage of a "once-returner"
 (sakadagami), one who is due to return to the sense sphere world only one
 more time.
 By eliminating sensual desire and aversion by means of the third path,
 he attains the state of a non-returner (anagami), no longer bound to the
 sense sphere but heading for rebirth in a pure divine abode, where he will
 reach the final goal.
 The fourth path cuts off the remaining five fetters — desire for existence
 in the fine material and immaterial planes, conceit, restlessness, and
 ignorance.
 With its attainment the yogin becomes an arahant, who has destroyed all
 the defilements and reached the state of perfect purification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Emancipation (Vimutti)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Dispassion is the supporting condition for emancipation": Each of the supramund
ane path-moments is immediately followed by several moments of a different
 kind of supramundane experience called "fruition" (phala).
 Fruition marks the enjoyment of the realized degree of release effected
 by the path's work of eradicating defilements.
 Whereas the attainment of the path is an extremely intense exhilarating
 experience requiring the expenditure of a tremendous quantum of energy,
 the attainment of fruition is characterized by its peacefulness, relaxedness,
 and blissful quiescence.
 If the path-attainment be illustrated by a captive's sudden bursting of
 the chains that hold him in captivity, fruition may be compared to his
 savoring the taste of freedom that lies beyond the captive state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The completion of the fourth path and fruition results in full emancipation
 (vimutti): "With the destruction of the cankers, he directly realizes for
 himself, enters, and abides in that emancipation of mind, emancipation
 of wisdom, which is cankerless."29 The subtlest and most tenacious fetters
 have been broken, and there is nothing now that makes for further bondage.
 Having destroyed the mental corruptions at their basic level of latency,
 the yogin has completed his task.
 There is nothing more to do, and nothing to add to what has been done.
 He abides in the living experience of deliverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emancipation realized by the arahant has a twofold aspect.
 One aspect is the emancipation from ignorance and defilements experienced
 during the course of his lifetime, the other the emancipation from repeated
 existence attained with his passing away.
 Through his complete penetration of the four noble truths, the arahant
 has eradicated ignorance and released his mind from the grip of the passions.
 The fading away of the passions issues in a stainless purity called emancipatio
n of mind (cetovimutti); the fading away of ignorance issues in a radiant
 awareness called emancipation of wisdom (paññavimutti).
 The mind of the arahant is at once impeccably pure through the absence
 of attachment and radiantly bright through the luminosity of wisdom.
 Endowed with this emancipation of mind and of wisdom, he can move and act
 in the world without being soiled by the mire of the world.
 He chooses, thinks, decides, and wills free from the compulsion of egoistic
 habits.
 The grasping of "I" and "mine" has ceased, the inclination to conceit can
 no more obsess him.
 Having seen the egoless nature of all phenomena he has cut through the
 tangle of egoistic constructs and become "a sage who is at peace" (muni
 santo).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since he has destroyed the defilements, whatever disturbances might assail
 a person on their account no longer assail him.
 Even though sublime and striking sense objects come into range of his perceptio
n they cannot overwhelm his mind: "His mind remains untouched, steadfast,
 unshakable, beholding the impermanency of everything."30 In the arahant
 greed, hatred, and delusion, the unwholesome roots which underlie all evil,
 have been totally abandoned.
 They are not merely suppressed, but withered up down to the level of their
 latencies, so that they are no longer able to spring up again in the future.
 This destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion is called the nibbana realizabl
e during life-time; it is nibbana visible here and now.
 "In so far as the monk has realized the complete extinction of greed, hatred,
 and delusion, in so far is nibbana realizable, immediate, inviting, attractive,
 and comprehensible to the wise."31 Because in this attainment the five aggregate
s continue to function, sustained by bodily vitality, it is also called
 "the nibbana element with a residue remaining."32
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But though for the arahant disturbances due to the defilements do not arise,
 he is still subject to "a measure of disturbance" conditioned by the body
 with its six sense faculties.33 Though he cannot be overcome by greed and
 aversion he still experiences pleasure and pain; though he cannot generate
 kamma binding to samsara he must still choose and act within the limits
 set by his circumstances.
 Such experience, however, is for the arahant purely residual.
 It is merely the playing out of his stored up kamma from the past, which
 can still fructify and call forth responses so long as the body acquired
 through prior craving stands.
 But because craving has now been inwardly exhausted, there lies ahead for
 him no renewal of the round of birth and death.
 All feelings, being experienced with detachment, not being delighted in,
 will become cool.
 They arouse no new craving, provoke no new expectations, lead to no new
 accumulations of kamma; they merely continue on devoid of fecundity until
 the end of the life span.
 With the break-up of the body at his passing away, the arahant makes an
 end to the beginningless process of becoming.
 This is the second stage of his emancipation — emancipation from renewed
 existence, from future birth, aging, and death: "The sage who is at peace
 is not born, does not age, does not die, does not tremble, does not yearn.
 For him there does not exist that on account of which he might be born.
 Not being born, how can he age? Not aging, how can he die?"34 Because,
 with the emancipation from continued existence, no residue of the aggregates
 persists, this attainment is called "the nibbana element without residue
 remaining."35
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Knowledge of Destruction (Khaya Ñana)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Emancipation is the supporting condition for the knowledge of destruction":
 Following each of the four paths and fruits there arises a retrospective
 cognition or "reviewing knowledge" (paccavekkhana ñana) which reviews the
 defilements that have been abandoned by the particular path and the defilements
 remaining to be eliminated.
 In the case of the last path and fruition, the path and fruition of arahatship,
 the reviewing knowledge ascertains that all defilements have been eradicated
 and that there are none left to be destroyed.
 This knowledge certifying the abandonment of the defilements arises immediately
 after the mind has been liberated from their grip by the full penetration
 of the four noble truths:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He understands as it really is: "This is suffering, this is the origin of
 suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, this is the path to the
 cessation of suffering.
 These are the cankers, this is the origin of the cankers, this is the cessation
 of the cankers.
 This is the path to the cessation of the cankers." As he is knowing and
 seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the canker of sensuality, from
 the canker of existence, and from the canker of ignorance.
 When it is liberated, the knowledge arises in him: "It is liberated."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— MN 39
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the text indicates, this cognizance of the mind's liberation is direct
 and personal, without dependence on others.
 Just as a keen sighted man can look into a pool of clear, limpid water
 and see for himself the shells, pebbles, gravel and shoals of fish.
 The liberated person can look into himself and see that his mind has been
 set free from the cankers.36
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The retrospective cognition of release involves two acts of ascertainment.
 The first, called the "knowledge of destruction" (khaya ñana), ascertains
 that all defilements have been abandoned at the root; the second, the "knowledg
e of non-arising" (anuppade ñana), ascertains that no defilement can ever
 arise again.
 The two together are also called the "knowledge and vision of emancipation"
 (vimutti ñanadassana), the use of the word "vision" again underscoring
 the perceptual immediacy of the cognition by which the mind verifies its
 own release from the defilements.
 By possessing this knowledge, one who has destroyed the defilements not
 only experiences the freedom that results from their destruction, but acquires
 as well an inner certitude with respect to their destruction.
 If a liberated individual only enjoyed liberation from the defilements
 without also enjoying indubitable knowledge that he is liberated, his attainmen
t would always be haunted by an inner suspicion that perhaps, after all,
 some area of vulnerability remains.
 Even though no defilement ever came to manifestation, the shadow of uncertainty
 would itself mar the attainment's claim to completeness.
 However, because the attainment of arahatship automatically generates a
 retrospective cognition ascertaining the final abandonment of all defilements,
 there is no room for such a suspicion to arise.
 Like a deer in a remote forest far from the reach of hunters, the one who
 has crossed over attachment to the world walks in confidence, stands in
 confidence, sits down in confidence, and sleeps in confidence.37 He is out
 of reach of the defilements, and knows he is out of their reach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers is not always set
 up in the arahant's awareness, it is permanently available to him, and
 awaits only his advertence to make itself present.
 Since the cankers have been eradicated, whenever the arahant looks into
 his mind he can see at once that they have been cut off.
 The suttas illustrate this with a bold simile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sandaka, it is like a man whose hands and feet have been cut off; whether
 he is walking or standing still or asleep or awake, constantly and perpetually
 are his hands and feet as though cut off; and moreover while he is reflecting
 on it, he knows: "My hands and feet have been cut off." Even so, Sandaka,
 whatever monk is a perfected one, the cankers destroyed, who has lived
 the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained his
 own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, freed by perfect profound
 knowledge, for him whether he is walking or standing still or asleep or
 awake, the cankers are as though destroyed; and moreover while he is reflecting
 on it, he knows: "My cankers are destroyed."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— MN 76 (trans, I.B.Horner)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arahant understands that the defilements he has eradicated brought bondage
 to the round of existence.
 He sees them as "defiling, conducive to renewed existence, afflictive,
 resulting in suffering, leading to future birth, aging, and death."38 Thence,
 by witnessing their utter eradication in himself, he gains certainty of
 his emancipation from the round: "Unshakable is my emancipation.
 This is my last birth.
 There is now no renewal of existence."39 Such knowledge remains an inalienable
 part of the arahant's spiritual inheritance.
 It is the basis for his assurance of immunity from future becoming.
 By reason of this knowledge he sounds the lion's roar with which he seals
 his triumph over the cycle of repeated births: "Destroyed is birth, lived
 is the holy life, the task has been completed, there is no returning to
 this state."

\begin_layout Standard
Buddhism originated with an Indian prince known as the Buddha, who taught
 in Northeast India in the fifth century BC.
 Two centuries later, with the support of the Emperor Asoka, Buddhism spread
 over the greater part of India and from there traveled the full breadth
 of the Asian continent.
 In several tidal waves of missionary zeal it rose up from its Indian homeland
 and inundated other regions, offering the peoples among whom it took root
 a solid foundation of faith and wisdom upon which to build their lives
 and a source of inspiration towards which to direct their hopes.
 At different points in history Buddhism has commanded followings in countries
 as diverse geographically, ethnically, and culturally as Afghanistan and
 Japan, Siberia and Cambodia, Korea and Sri Lanka; yet all have looked towards
 the same Indian sage as their master.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though for historical reasons Buddhism eventually disappeared from India
 by about the twelfth century, before it vanished it had profoundly transformed
 Hinduism.
 In our own time Indian thinkers as different as Swami Vivekananda, Tagore,
 Gandhi, and Nehru have looked upon the Buddha as a model.
 In the twentieth century, too, while Buddhism has lost much of its following
 in the East, it has begun to have a growing impact on an increasing number
 of people in the West, and in its own quiet way it is sending down firm
 roots in several countries of the Western hemisphere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the course of its long history Buddhism has assumed a wide variety of
 forms.
 Because of its peaceful, non-dogmatic character, it has always adapted
 easily to the pre-existent cultures and religious practices of the people
 among whom it has spread, becoming in turn the fountainhead of a new culture
 and world view.
 So successful has Buddhism been in integrating itself with a country's
 indigenous culture that it is often difficult for us to discern the common
 thread that binds the different forms of Buddhism together as branches
 of the same religion.
 The outer surfaces differ so greatly: from the gentle, ceremonial Theravada
 Buddhism of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, to the contemplative and devotional
 practices of Far Eastern Mahayana Buddhism, to the mysterious ritualism
 of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism.
 Yet, though the outer faces of these Buddhist schools may differ drastically,
 they all remain rooted in a common source, the life and teaching of the
 man known to us as the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, though the Buddha stands so far back from us in time, further
 back than all the later teachers who rose to eminence in the river of Buddhist
 history, it is still his voice that speaks to us most directly, in a language
 we can immediately understand, in words, images, and ideas to which we
 can immediately respond.
 If we place side by side the texts of the Chandogya Upanishad and the Buddha's
 Discourse on the Four Noble Truths, which are separated in time by perhaps
 only a hundred years, the former seems to come from a cultural and spiritual
 milieu so remote we can hardly comprehend it, while the latter sounds almost
 as if it had been spoken last week in Bombay, London, or New York.
 In attitude and perspective the Buddha comes so close to us it is hard
 to believe he is separated from us by a gulf of some 2,500 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the Buddha's teaching should remain perennially relevant throughout
 the changing eras of human history, that his message should be undimmed
 by the sheer passage of time, is already implicit in the title by which
 he is most commonly known.
 For the word "Buddha," as is widely known, is not a proper name but an
 honorific title meaning "the Enlightened One," "the Awakened One." This
 title is given to him because he has woken up from the deep sleep of ignorance
 in which the rest of the world is absorbed; because he has penetrated the
 deepest truths about the human condition; and because he proclaims those
 truths with the aim of awakening others and enabling them to share his
 realization.
 Despite the shifting scenarios of history over twenty-five centuries, despite
 the change in world views and modes of thought from one epoch to the next,
 the basic truths of human life do not change.
 They remain constant, and are recognizable to those mature enough to reflect
 on them and intelligent enough to understand them.
 For this reason, even today in our age of jet travel, computer technology,
 and genetic engineering, it is perfectly fitting that the One who has Awakened
 should speak to us in words that are just as powerful, just as cogent,
 just as illuminating as they were when they were first proclaimed long
 ago in the towns and villages of Northeast India.

 The Life of the Buddha
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we cannot determine with absolute precision the dates of the Buddha's
 life, many scholars agree that he lived from approximately 563 to 483 BC;
 a growing number of scholars follow a different chronology which places
 the dates about eighty years later.
 As is natural with a spiritual leader who has made such a powerful impact
 on human civilization, the account of his life that has come down to us
 has been embroidered with myth and legend, which serve to bring before
 the mind's eye the loftiness of his spiritual stature.
 Nevertheless, in the oldest source on the Buddha's life, the Sutta Pitaka
 of the Pali Canon, we find a number of texts from which we can construct
 a fairly realistic picture of his career.
 What is striking about the picture given by these texts is that it shows
 the Buddha's life as a series of lessons which embody and convey the essential
 points of his teaching.
 Thus, in his own life, the person and the message merge together in an
 indissoluble union.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The future master was born into the Sakyan clan in a small republic nestled
 in the Himalayan foothills, in a region which at present lies in southern
 Nepal.
 His given name was Siddhattha (Skt: Siddhartha) and his family name Gotama
 (Gautama).
 Legend holds that he was the son of a powerful monarch, but in actuality
 the Sakyan state was an oligarchic republic, so his father was probably
 the chief of the ruling council of elders.
 By the Buddha's time the Sakyan state had become a tributary of the powerful
 state of Kosala, which corresponds to present-day Uttar Pradesh.
 Even the oldest suttas tell us that the infant's birth was attended by
 various wonders.
 Soon afterwards, a sage named Asita came to visit the baby, and recognizing
 on his body the marks of future greatness, he bowed down to the child in
 homage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a royal youth, Prince Siddhattha was raised in luxury.
 His father had built for him three palaces, one for each season of the
 year, and there he enjoyed himself in the company of his friends.
 At the age of sixteen he married his cousin, a beautiful princess named
 Yasodhara, and lived a contented life in the Sakyan capital, Kapilavatthu;
 during this time he was probably trained in the martial arts and the skills
 of statecraft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the years passed, however, when he reached his late twenties, the prince
 became increasingly introspective.
 What troubled him were the great burning issues we ordinarily take for
 granted — the questions concerning the purpose and meaning of our lives.
 Is the purpose of our existence the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, the
 achievement of wealth and status, the exercise of power? Or is there something
 beyond these, more real and fulfilling? These must have been the questions
 that rippled across his mind, for we find his own reflections recorded
 for us in a discourse called "The Noble Quest" (MN 26):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Monks, before my enlightenment, being myself subject to birth, aging, sickness
 and death, to sorrow and defilement, I sought what was subject to birth,
 aging, sickness and death, to sorrow and defilement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I considered thus: "Why, being subject to birth...
 to defilement, should I seek what is subject to birth...
 and defilement? Suppose that, being myself subject to birth, having understood
 the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn, the supreme
 security from bondage, Nibbana.
 Suppose that, being myself subject to aging, sickness and death, to sorrow
 and defilement, I seek the unaging, unailing, deathless, sorrowless and
 undefiled state, the supreme security from bondage, Nibbana."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, at the age of 29, in the prime of life, with his parents weeping,
 he cut off his hair and beard, put on the saffron robes of a mendicant,
 and entered upon the homeless life of renunciation.
 The developed Buddha biography adds that he left the palace on the very
 day that his wife gave birth to their only child, the boy Rahula.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having left behind his home and family, the Bodhisatta or "seeker of enlightenme
nt" (as he is now called) headed south for Magadha (present-day Bihar),
 in whose environs small groups of seekers were quietly pursuing their quest
 for spiritual illumination, usually under the guidance of a guru.
 At the time northern India could boast of a number of accomplished masters
 famous for their philosophical systems and achievements in meditation.
 Prince Siddhattha sought out two of the most eminent, Alara Kalama and
 Uddaka Ramaputta.
 From them he learned systems of meditation which, from the descriptions
 in the texts, seem to have been forerunners of Raja Yoga.
 The Bodhisatta mastered their teachings and systems of meditation, but
 though he reached exalted levels of concentration (samadhi), he found these
 teachings insufficient, for they did not lead to the goal he was seeking:
 perfect enlightenment and the realization of Nibbana, release from the
 sufferings of sentient existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having left his teachers, the Bodhisatta adopted a different path, one that
 was popular in ancient India and still has followers today: the path of
 asceticism, of self-mortification, pursued in the conviction that liberation
 is to be won by afflicting the body with pain beyond its normal levels
 of endurance.
 For six years the Bodhisatta followed this method with unyielding determination.
 He fasted for days on end until his body looked like a skeleton cloaked
 in skin; he exposed himself to the heat of the midday sun and the cold
 of the night; he subjected his flesh to such torments that he came almost
 to the door of death.
 Yet he found that despite his persistence and sincerity these austerities
 were futile.
 Later he would say that he took the path of self-mortification further
 than all other ascetics, yet it led, not to higher wisdom and enlightenment,
 but only to physical weakness and the deterioration of his mental faculties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just then he thought of another path to enlightenment, one which balanced
 proper care of the body with sustained contemplation and deep investigation.
 He would later call this path "the middle way" because it avoids the extremes
 of sensual indulgence and self-mortification.
 He had experienced both extremes, the former as a prince and the latter
 as an ascetic, and he knew they were ultimately dead ends.
 To follow the middle way, however, he realized he would first have to regain
 his strength.
 Thus he gave up his practice of austerities and resumed taking nutritious
 food.
 At the time five other ascetics had been living in attendance on the Bodhisatta
, hoping that when he attained enlightenment he would serve as their guide.
 But when they saw him partake of substantial meals, they became disgusted
 with him and left him, thinking the princely ascetic had given up his exertion
 and reverted to a life of luxury.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now he was alone, and complete solitude allowed him to pursue his quest
 undisturbed.
 One day, when his physical strength had returned, he approached a lovely
 spot in Uruvela by the bank of the Nerañjara River.
 Here he prepared a seat of straw beneath an asvattha tree (later called
 the Bodhi Tree) and sat down cross-legged, making a firm resolution that
 he would never rise up from that seat until he had won his goal.
 As night descended he entered into deeper and deeper stages of meditation
 until his mind was perfectly calm and composed.
 Then, the records tell us, in the first watch of the night he directed
 his concentrated mind to the recollection of his previous lives.
 Gradually there unfolded before his inner vision his experiences in many
 past births, even during many cosmic aeons; in the middle watch of the
 night he developed the "divine eye" by which he could see beings passing
 away and taking rebirth in accordance with their karma, their deeds; and
 in the last watch of the night he penetrated the deepest truths of existence,
 the most basic laws of reality, and thereby removed from his mind the subtlest
 veils of ignorance.
 When dawn broke, the figure sitting beneath the tree was no longer a Bodhisatta
, a seeker of enlightenment, but a Buddha, a Perfectly Enlightened One,
 one who had attained the Deathless in this very life itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For several weeks the newly awakened Buddha remained in the vicinity of
 the Bodhi Tree contemplating from different angles the Dhamma, the truth
 he had discovered.
 Then he came to a new crossroad in his spiritual career: Was he to teach,
 to try to share his realization with others, or should he instead remain
 quietly in the forest, enjoying the bliss of liberation alone?
\end_layout

At first his mind inclined to keeping quiet; for he thought the truth he
 had realized was just too deep for others to understand, too difficult
 to express in words, and he was concerned he would just weary himself trying
 to convey his realization to others.
 But now the texts introduce a dramatic element into the story.
 Just at the moment the Buddha decided to remain silent, a high deity named
 Brahma Sahampati, the Lord of a Thousand Worlds, realized that if the Master
 remained silent the world would be lost, deprived of the stainless path
 to deliverance from suffering.
 Therefore he descended to earth, bowed down low before the Enlightened
 One, and humbly pleaded with him to teach the Dhamma "for the sake of those
 with little dust in their eyes."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha then gazed out upon the world with his profound vision.
 He saw that people are like lotuses in a pond at different stages of growth,
 and he understood that just as some lotuses close to the surface of the
 water need only the sun's rays to rise above the surface and fully blossom,
 so there are some people who need only to hear the noble teaching to win
 enlightenment and gain perfect liberation of mind.
 When he saw this his heart was stirred by deep compassion, and he decided
 to go back into the world and to teach the Dhamma to those who were ready
 to listen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first ones he approached were his former companions, the five ascetics
 who had deserted him a few months earlier and were now dwelling in a deer
 park at Sarnath near Benares.
 He explained to them the truths he had discovered, and on hearing his discourse
 they gained insight into the Dhamma, becoming his first disciples.
 In the months ahead his following grew by leaps and bounds as both householders
 and ascetics heard the liberating message, gave up their former creeds,
 and declared themselves disciples of the Enlightened One.

Each year, even into his old age, he would wander among the villages, towns,
 and cities of the Ganges plain, teaching all who would lend an ear; he
 would rest only for the three months of the rainy season, and then resume
 his wanderings, which took him from present Delhi even as far east as Bengal.
 He established a Sangha, an order of monks and nuns, for which he laid
 down an intricate body of rules and regulations; this order still remains
 alive today, perhaps (along with the Jain order) the world's oldest continuous
 institution.
 He also attracted many lay followers who became devoted supporters of the
 Master and his Sangha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After an active ministry of forty-five years, at the ripe age of eighty,
 the Buddha headed for the northern town of Kusinara.
 There, surrounded by many disciples, he passed away into the "Nibbana element
 with no remainder of conditioned existence," severing forever his bondage
 to the round of rebirths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I said earlier that each of the major events in the Buddha's life gives
 us a specific object lesson in his teaching.
 Now I want to draw out the lessons suggested by these events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the Bodhisatta's awakening to the harsh realities of human existence
 — his discovery of our bondage to old age, illness, and death — teaches
 us the importance of deep reflection and critical thinking.
 His awakening reflects back to us the somnambulance in which we usually
 live, mired in our pleasures and petty concerns, oblivious to the "great
 affair" staring us in the face at every moment of our lives.
 His awakening reminds us that we ourselves must emerge from the comfortable
 but dangerous cocoon of ignorance in which we have settled down; that we
 must break away from our thoughtless infatuation with our youth, health,
 and vitality; that we must rise to a new level of mature understanding
 which will enable us to triumph in our inevitable encounter with the Lord
 of Death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bodhisatta's departure from the palace, his "great renunciation," teaches
 us a lesson in values.
 It shows us that from among the wide range of values which we can draw
 upon to give order to our lives, the quest for enlightenment and liberation
 should reign supreme.
 This goal ranks far above the pleasure, wealth, and power to which we ordinaril
y give priority, even above the call of social duty and mundane responsibilities.
 This does not mean, of course, that everyone who wants to follow the Buddha's
 path must be ready to leave behind home and family and adopt the lifestyle
 of a monk or nun.
 The Buddha's community of disciples included many householders as well
 as monks, devout laymen and laywomen who attained high levels of awakening
 while living active lives within the world.
 But the Buddha's example does show us that we must all order our values
 according to a scale which gives the highest place to the most worthy goal,
 to that which is also the most real of all realities, Nibbana; and we should
 never allow the claims of mundane obligations to pull us away from pursuing
 our aspiration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, the Bodhisatta's six years of struggle shows us that the quest for
 the highest goal is a strenuous undertaking that calls for deep dedication
 and unrelenting effort.
 Fortunately for us, the Bodhisatta found that the practice of self-mortificatio
n is a fruitless exercise, and thus we need not follow him in this direction.
 But his uncompromising pursuit of truth underscores the degree of effort
 that the quest for enlightenment requires, and those who seek such a goal
 in full earnestness must be ready to submit to a difficult and demanding
 course of training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha's enlightenment teaches us that ultimate wisdom and deliverance
 from suffering is a real potential inherent in human beings, one we can
 realize for ourselves without the aid or grace of an external savior.
 His enlightenment also highlights the ideal of sensible moderation, "the
 middle way," which has characterized Buddhism throughout its long history.
 The quest for truth may be a difficult undertaking, one which makes harsh
 demands on us, but it does not ask us to subject ourselves to penance and
 self-punishment.
 Final victory is to be won, not by tormenting the body, but by developing
 the mind, and this takes place through a course of training that balances
 care for the body with the cultivation of our higher spiritual faculties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision the Buddha made after his enlightenment brings home another
 lesson to us.
 At this critical juncture, when he was faced with the choice of either
 keeping his enlightenment to himself or taking up the challenge of teaching
 others, the mandate of compassion prevailed in his heart.
 Leaving behind the quietude of the forest, he took upon himself the burden
 of guiding errant humanity along the path to liberation.
 This choice has had a tremendous impact on the subsequent development of
 Buddhism, for throughout its long history the spirit of compassion has
 been the heartbeat of the Buddha's dispensation, its innermost animating
 spirit.
 It was the Buddha's compassionate example that motivated Buddhist monks
 and nuns to travel across seas, mountains, and deserts, at the risk of
 their lives, to share the blessings of the Dhamma with those still lost
 in darkness.
 It is this example that inspires many Buddhists today, in a wide variety
 of ways, even when they can express their compassion only in humble acts
 of kindness and tender concern for those less fortunate than themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the Buddha's passing away, his attainment of final Nibbana, teaches
 us once again that everything conditioned must perish, that all formations
 are impermanent, that even the greatest of spiritual masters is no exception
 to the very law he so often proclaimed.
 His passing away also teaches us that the highest bliss and peace comes
 only by relinquishing all, through the stilling of all conditioned things.
 For this is the final entrance way to the attainment of the unconditioned,
 the Deathless, Nibbana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The Buddha's Mission
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ask why the Buddha's teaching proved so attractive and gained such a
 large following among all sectors of Northeast Indian society is to raise
 a question which is also relevant to us today.
 For we live at a time when Buddhism is exerting a strong appeal upon an
 increasing number of people, especially among those whose level of education
 and capacity for reflection has made them indifferent to the claims of
 revealed religion.
 I believe the remarkable success of Buddhism, as well as its contemporary
 appeal, can be understood principally in terms of two factors: one, the
 aim of the teaching; and the other, its methodological features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(i) The Aim of the Teaching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the so-called revealed religions, which rest upon faith in unverifiable
 doctrines, the Buddha formulated his teaching in a way that directly addresses
 the critical problem at the heart of human existence — the problem of suffering
 — and he promises that those who follow his teaching to its end will realize
 here and now the highest happiness and peace.
 All other concerns apart from this, such as theological dogmas, metaphysical
 subtleties, rituals and rules of worship, the Buddha waves aside as irrelevant
 to the task at hand, the unraveling of the problem of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This pragmatic thrust of the Dhamma is clearly illustrated by an incident
 related in the texts.
 Once a monk named Malunkyaputta was pondering the great metaphysical questions
 — whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, infinite or finite, etc.
 — and he felt unhappy because the Buddha had refused to answer them.
 So one day Malunkyaputta went to the Master and told him, "Either you answer
 these questions for me or I leave the order."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha then told Malunkyaputta that the spiritual life did not depend
 on any answers to these questions, which were mere distractions from the
 real challenge of following the path.
 He then compared the metaphysician to a man struck by a poisoned arrow.
 When his relatives bring a surgeon, the man tells him, " I won't let you
 remove the arrow until you let me know the name of the man who struck me,
 the type of bow he used, the material from which the arrow was made, and
 the kind of poison he used." That man would die, the Buddha said, before
 the arrow was removed, and so too the metaphysician, struck with the arrow
 of suffering, will die without ever finding the path to freedom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only does the Buddha make suffering and release from suffering the focus
 of his teaching, but he deals with the problem of suffering in a way that
 reveals an extraordinary degree of psychological insight.
 Like a psychoanalyst, the Buddha traces suffering to its roots within our
 minds, to our craving and clinging, and he holds that the cure, the solution
 to the problem of suffering, must also be achieved within our minds.
 To gain freedom from suffering it is futile to pray to the gods, to worship
 holy objects, to attach ourselves to rituals and ceremonies.
 Since suffering arises from our own mental defilements, we have to purify
 our minds of these defilements, from our greed, hatred, and ignorance,
 and this requires profound inner honesty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While other religions lead us outward — towards ideas of a deity who determines
 our fate, or to lofty philosophical abstractions like the idea of a universal
 self or a nondual reality in which all opposites are resolved — the Buddha
 leads us back to ourselves, always keeping his teaching attuned to the
 hard facts of experience.
 He places the mind at the forefront of his analysis and says that it is
 the mind which fashions our actions, the mind which shapes our destiny,
 the mind which leads us towards misery or happiness.
 The beginning point of the teaching is the ordinary mind, in bondage and
 subject to suffering; the end point is the enlightened mind, completely
 purified and liberated from suffering.
 The whole teaching unfolds between these two points, taking the most direct
 route.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(ii) Characteristic Features of the Teaching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Self-reliance.
 This discussion of the aim of the Buddha's teaching leads us to the teaching's
 characteristic features.
 One of its most attractive features, closely related to its psychological
 orientation, is its emphasis on self-reliance.
 For the Buddha, the key to liberation is mental purity and correct understandin
g, and for this reason he rejects the notion that we can gain salvation
 by leaning on any external authority.
 He says: "By oneself is evil done, by oneself is one defiled.
 By oneself is evil left undone, by oneself is one purified.
 Purity and defilement depend on oneself; no one can purify another" (Dhp
 165).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This stress on human effort, on our capacity to liberate ourselves, is a
 distinctive feature of early Buddhism and offers a remarkable affirmation
 of the human potential.
 The Buddha does not claim any divine status for himself, nor does he assert
 that he is an agent of human salvation.
 He claims to be, not a personal savior, but a guide and teacher: "You yourselve
s must strive, the Buddha only points the way.
 Those who meditate and practice the path are freed from the bonds of death"
 (Dhp 276).
 Throughout his ministry he urged his disciples to "be islands to yourselves,
 be refuges to yourselves, without looking to any external refuge." Even
 on his deathbed he gave his followers this last piece of advice: "All condition
ed things are subject to decay.
 Attain the goal by diligence."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Experiential Emphasis.
 Since wisdom or insight is the chief instrument of enlightenment, the Buddha
 always asked his disciples to follow him on the basis of their own understandin
g, not from obedience or unquestioning trust.
 He calls his Dhamma ehipassiko, which means "Come and see for yourself."
 He invites inquirers to investigate his teaching, to examine it in the
 light of their own reason and intelligence, and to gain confirmation of
 its truth for themselves.
 The Dhamma is said to be paccattam veditabbo viññuhi, "to be personally
 understood by the wise," and this requires intelligence and sustained inquiry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the Buddha arrived at the town of a people called the Kalamas, who
 had been visited by many other ascetics.
 Each visiting teacher would praise his own doctrine to the sky and tear
 down the views of his rivals, and this left the Kalamas utterly confused.
 So when the Buddha arrived they came to him, explained their dilemma, and
 asked if he could offer some guidance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha did not praise his own teaching and attack his rivals.
 Rather, he told them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is right for you to doubt; doubt has arisen in you about dubious matters.
 Come, Kalamas, do not rely on oral tradition, or on the lineage of teachers,
 or on holy scriptures, or on abstract logic.
 Do not place blind trust in impressive personalities or in venerated gurus,
 but examine the issue for yourselves.
 When you know for yourselves that something is unwholesome and harmful,
 then you should reject it.
 And when you know for yourselves that something is wholesome and beneficial,
 then you should accept it and put it into practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— AN 3.65
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Universality.
 Because the Buddha's teaching deals with the most universal of all human
 problems, the problem of suffering, he made his teaching a universal message,
 one which was addressed to all human beings solely by reason of their humanity.
 At the time the Buddha appeared on the Indian scene the higher religious
 teachings, recorded in the Vedas, were reserved for the brahmans, a privileged
 elite who performed sacrifices and rituals for others.
 Ordinary people were told to perform their duties in a spirit of humility
 in the hope that they might win a more fortunate rebirth and thus gain
 access to the sacred teachings.
 But the Buddha placed no restrictions on the people to whom he taught the
 Dhamma.
 He held that what made a person noble was his personal character and conduct,
 not his family and caste status.
 Thus he opened the doors of liberation to people of all social classes.
 Brahmans, kings and princes, merchants, farmers, workers, even outcasts
 — all were welcome to hear the Dhamma without discrimination, and many
 from the lower classes attained the highest stage of enlightenment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the wider Indian society the Buddha did not attempt to abolish the
 caste system, which, it seems, had not yet developed into the complex,
 oppressive system it became several centuries later.
 However, he flatly rejected the orthodox brahman view that a person's class
 status was an indication of his intrinsic worth.
 Within the Sangha, the monastic order, he completely disregarded all distinctio
ns of social class, declaring,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as the waters of the four great rivers flow into the ocean and become
 known simply as the water of the ocean, so when people of all four social
 classes go forth as monks in my teaching, they give up their social status
 and become known simply as disciples of the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— Ud 5.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As part of his universalist project, the Buddha also threw open the doors
 of his teaching to women.
 Among the followers of Brahmanism, sacred teachings were the province of
 men.
 Women were to perform their domestic chores dutifully, to care for their
 husbands and in-laws, and to bear children, preferably sons.
 They were excluded from performing the Vedic rituals and even the teachings
 of the Upanishads were, with rare exceptions, the prerogative of men.
 The Buddha, in contrast, taught the Dhamma freely to both men and women.
 At first he hesitated to establish an order of nuns, since this would have
 been a radical step in his age; but once he agreed to create the order
 of nuns, women from all walks of life — princesses, housewives, daughters
 of good family, servant women, even former prostitutes — went forth into
 homelessness and attained the highest goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 A Code of Ethics.
 One aspect of the Buddha's universalism deserves special mention: this
 is his conception of a universal code of ethics.
 It would be too extreme to say that the Buddha was the first religious
 teacher to formulate a moral code, for moral codes of different kinds had
 been laid down from the dawn of civilization.
 But it might not be farfetched to say that the Buddha was one of the very
 first teachers to separate out true moral principles from the complex fabric
 of social norms and communal customs with which they were generally interwoven.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With astute sophistication of thought, the Buddha provides for us an abstract
 principle to use as a guideline in determining the basic precepts of morality.
 This is the rule of "using oneself as a standard" (attanam upamam katva)
 for deciding how to treat others.
 From this abstract principle, he derives the four main precepts of his
 moral code: to abstain from killing, from stealing, from sexual misconduct,
 and from lying.
 In the interest of personal welfare and communal harmony he adds a fifth:
 to abstain from intoxicants.
 Together, these give us the Five Precepts (pañcasila), the basic moral
 code of Buddhism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha, however, did not regard morality merely as a set of rules based
 on reasoning.
 He taught that there is a universal law which connects our conduct with
 our personal destinies, ensuring that moral justice ultimately prevails
 in the world.
 This is the law of karma and its fruit, which holds that our intentional
 actions determine the type of rebirth we take and the diverse experiences
 we undergo in the course of our lives.
 This law is utterly impersonal in its operation.
 It gives no one preferential treatment; it recognizes no VIPs or favorites,
 but works with absolute uniformity towards all.
 Those who violate the laws of morality — whether they be high class or
 low class, rich or poor — acquire unwholesome karma and must suffer the
 consequences: a bad rebirth and future misery.
 Those who adhere to the moral rules, who engage in virtuous conduct, acquire
 wholesome karma leading to future benefits: a good rebirth, a happy life,
 and progress on the way to final liberation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conformity with the psychological orientation of his teaching, the Buddha
 gave special attention to the subjective springs of morality.
 He traces immoral behavior to three mental factors called the "three unwholesom
e roots" — greed, hatred, and delusion; and he traces ethical behavior to
 their opposites, the three wholesome roots — non-greed or generosity, non-hate
 or kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom.
 He also directs us to a more refined interior level of ethical purity to
 be achieved by developing, in meditation, four lofty attitudes called the
 "divine abodes" (brahma-vihara).
 These are loving-kindness (metta), the wish for the happiness and welfare
 of all beings; compassion (karuna), the wish that all afflicted with suffering
 be freed from their suffering; altruistic joy (mudita), rejoicing in the
 happiness and success of others; and equanimity (upekkha), impartiality
 of mind.
 These four attitudes are to be developed universally, towards all beings
 without distinctions or discrimination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I close there is one further feature of the Buddha's method that
 I want to mention.
 This is what might be called his "skill in means." Through his deep meditative
 attainments and his enlightened wisdom, the Buddha had the special ability
 to discover the precise way to teach the people who came to him for guidance.
 He could read deep into the hidden recesses of a person's heart, perceive
 that person's aptitudes and interests, and frame his teaching in the exact
 way needed to transform that person and lead him or her on to the path
 of freedom.
 The texts abound in many examples of this supreme pedagogic skill of the
 Buddha.
 Here I will relate just two famous instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first is the case of Angulimala, a serial killer who lived in the forests
 of Kosala outside the capital Savatthi.
 Angulimala repeatedly attacked travelers, killed them, and cut off their
 fingers, which he wove into a necklace that he wore around his neck.
 He had killed hundreds of people and was feared throughout the kingdom.
 He was "wanted dead or alive," but no one had the courage to pursue him.
 The Buddha saw, however, with his supernormal vision, that Angulimala had
 another side to his character: as terrible as he was, he had the hidden
 potential to become an arahant, a saint.
 Thus one day, all alone, he headed out for the forest where Angulimala
 was dwelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Angulimala saw him he thought, "Ah, now I will kill this ascetic and
 cut off his finger for my necklace." He started to run after him with his
 knife poised in the air.
 But no matter how fast he ran he could not reach him.
 For the Buddha, while walking along slowly, had performed a feat of psychic
 power such that Angulimala, running with all his might, could not catch
 up with him.
 Angulimala ran and ran but could not gain an inch.
 He then called out, "Stop, ascetic, stop!" The Buddha replied, "I have
 stopped, Angulimala, you stop too."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This statement had a deep impact on the criminal, an impact which struck
 down to the depths of his heart.
 He realized that the ascetic before him was the famous teacher, the Enlightened
 One, and he knew the Buddha had come to him out of compassion, to save
 him from his terrible deeds.
 He threw away his knife, bowed down at the Master's feet, and asked to
 be accepted as a monk.
 The Buddha admitted him into the order and after a short time Angulimala
 became an arahant, perfectly wise and deeply compassionate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second story concerns the woman Kisagotami.
 She was a poor woman who had married into a wealthy family, but she did
 not bear children and was thus scorned by her in-laws.
 This made her very miserable.
 But after some time she conceived and gave birth to a son, who became for
 her the source of boundless joy.
 Now that she had brought forth an heir to their wealth, everyone else in
 her husband's family too accepted her.
 But a few months after his birth the child died, and Kisagotami became
 distraught.
 She refused to believe the boy was dead, but convinced herself he was only
 ill.
 Thus she went around everywhere asking people to give her medicine for
 her son.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The townsfolk ridiculed her and abused her, calling her a mad woman, until
 she finally came into the presence of the Buddha.
 When she asked him for medicine, he did not give her an eloquent sermon
 on impermanence.
 He told her that he could indeed make some medicine for her son, but first
 she would have to bring him one ingredient: mustard seeds from a home where
 no one had ever died.
 Quite optimistic, she went from house to house, asking for mustard seeds.
 At each door people readily gave her seeds, but when she asked the donor
 whether anyone in that home had ever died, she was told, "Here a father
 has died, here a mother, here a wife, here a husband, a brother, a sister,"
 and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She thus came to see that death is the universal fate of all living beings,
 not a unique calamity that befell her own son.
 So she returned to the Buddha, aware now of the universal law of impermanence.
 When the Master saw her coming he asked her, "Did you bring the mustard
 seeds, Gotami?" And she replied: "Done, sir, is this business of the mustard
 seeds.
 Grant me a refuge." The Buddha had her ordained as a nun, and after some
 time she realized the highest goal and became one of the most eminent nuns
 in the Bhikkhuni Sangha or Order of Nuns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, the Buddha's mission was to establish a path to spiritual perfection,
 to full enlightenment and Nibbana, liberation from suffering.
 He did this by propounding a teaching that acknowledged our capacity for
 attaining spiritual perfection yet which also remained fully respectful
 of the intelligence and autonomy of human beings.
 His approach was psychological in orientation, non-dogmatic, pragmatic,
 and open to investigation.
 He emphasized self-effort, moral rectitude, and personal responsibility,
 and he proclaimed his message universally, holding that the potential for
 spiritual growth and even for the highest enlightenment was accessible
 to anyone who makes the appropriate effort.
 It is these factors that give to the ancient teaching of the Buddha such
 a distinctly modern flavor, making it so relevant to us in these times
 of shifting ideas and changing values.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These talks — except for the two marked otherwise — were originally given
 for the benefit of Mrs.
 Pow Panga Vathanakul, a follower of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa who had
 contracted cancer of the bone marrow and had come to practice meditation
 at Wat Pa Baan Taad in order to contend with the pain of the disease and
 the fact of her approaching death.
 All in all, she stayed at Wat Pa Baan Taad for 102 days, from November
 9, 1975 to February 19, 1976; during that period Venerable Acariya Maha
 Boowa gave 84 impromptu talks for her benefit, all of which were tape recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After her death in September, 1976, one of her friends, M.R.
 Sermsri Kasemsri, asked permission of the Venerable Acariya to transcribe
 the talks and print them in book form.
 Seventy-seven of the talks, plus an additional eight talks given on other
 occasions, were thus printed in two massive volumes together totaling more
 than 1,000 pages.
 Six talks from these two volumes have already been translated into English
 and published in a book entitled Amata Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The talks in the present collection all deal with the practice of meditation,
 and particularly with the development of discernment.
 Because their style of presentation is personal and impromptu, they will
 probably be best understood if read in conjunction with a more systematic
 introduction to the techniques of meditation, such as the Venerable Acariya's
 own book, Wisdom Develops Samadhi, which is available separately or as
 part of the volume, Forest Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The title of the present book is taken from a request, frequently made by
 the Venerable Acariya to his listeners, that his teachings be taken to
 heart, because they come straight from the heart.

In these talks, as in Thai usage in general, the words 'heart' and 'mind'
 are used interchangeably.

The Language of the Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Venerable Acariya Mun taught that all hearts have the same language.
 No matter what one's language or nationality, the heart has nothing but
 simple awareness, which is why he said that all hearts have the same language.
 When a thought arises, we understand it, but when we put it into words,
 it has to become this or that language, so that we don't really understand
 one another.
 The feelings within the heart, though, are the same for everyone.
 This is why the Dhamma fits the heart perfectly, because the Dhamma isn't
 any particular language.
 The Dhamma is the language of the heart.
 The Dhamma resides with the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pleasure and pain reside with the heart.
 The acts that create pleasure and pain are thought up by the heart.
 The heart is what knows the results that appear as pleasure and pain; and
 the heart is burdened with the outcome of its own thoughts.
 This is why the heart and the Dhamma fit perfectly.
 No matter what our language or nationality, we can all understand the Dhamma
 because the heart and the Dhamma are a natural pair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart forms the core within the body.
 It's the core, the substance, the primary essence within the body.
 It's the basic foundation.
 The conditions that arise from the mind, such as thought-formations, appear
 and vanish, again and again.
 Here I'm referring to the rippling of the mind.
 When the mind ripples, that's the formation of a thought.
 Labels, which deal with conjecturing, memorizing, and recognizing, are
 termed sañña.
 'Long' thoughts are sañña; short thoughts are sankhara.
 In other words, when a thought forms — 'blip' — that's a sankhara.Sañña
 refers to labeling and recognizing.
 Viññana refers to the act of taking note when anything external comes and
 makes contact with the senses, as when visible forms make contact with
 the eye and cognition results.
 All of these things are constantly arising and vanishing of their own accord,
 and so the Buddha called them khandhas.
 Each 'heap' or 'group' is called a khandha.
 These five heaps of khandhas are constantly arising and vanishing all the
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even arahants have these same conditions — just like ordinary people everywhere
 — the only difference being that the arahants' khandhas are khandhas pure
 and simple, without any defilements giving them orders, making them do
 this or think that.
 Instead, their khandhas think out of their own free nature, with nothing
 forcing them to think this or that, unlike the minds of ordinary people
 in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make a comparison, the khandhas of ordinary people are like prisoners,
 constantly being ordered about.
 Their various thoughts, labels, assumptions, and interpretations have something
 that orders and forces them to appear, making them think, assume, and interpret
 in this way or that.
 In other words, they have defilements as their boss, their leader, ordering
 them to appear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arahants, however, don't.
 When a thought forms, it simply forms.
 Once it forms, it simply disappears.
 There's no seed to continue it, no seed to weigh the mind down, because
 there's nothing to force it, unlike the khandhas governed by defilements
 or under the leadership of defilements.
 This is where the difference lies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But their basic nature is the same: All the khandhas we have mentioned are
 inconstant (aniccam).
 In other words, instability and changeability are a regular part of their
 nature, beginning with the rupa khandha, our body, and the vedana khandha,
 feelings of pleasure, pain, and indifference.
 These things appear and vanish, again and again.
 Sañña, sankhara, and viññana are also always in a state of appearing and
 vanishing as a normal part of their nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as for actual awareness — which forms the basis of our knowledge of
 the various things that arise and vanish — that doesn't vanish.
 We can say that the mind can't vanish.
 We can say that the mind can't arise.
 A mind that has been purified thus has no more problems concerning the
 birth and death of the body and the khandhas; and thus there is no more
 birth here and there, appearing in crude forms such as individuals or as
 living beings, for those whose minds have been purified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those whose minds are not purified: They are the ones who take birth
 and die, setting their sights on cemeteries without end, all because of
 this undying mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why the Lord Buddha taught the world, and in particular the world
 of human beings, who know right and wrong, good and evil; who know how
 to foster the one and remedy the other; who understand the language of
 the Dhamma he taught.
 This is why he taught the human world above and beyond the other worlds:
 so that we could try to remedy the things that are harmful and detrimental,
 removing them from our thoughts, words, and deeds; try to nourish and foster
 whatever goodness we might already have, and give rise to whatever goodness
 we don't yet have.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He taught us to foster and develop the goodness we already have so as to
 nourish the heart, giving it refreshment and well-being, giving it a standard
 of quality, or goodness, so that when it leaves its present body to head
 for whatever place or level of being, this mind that has been constantly
 nourished with goodness will be a good mind.
 Wherever it fares, it will fare well.
 Wherever it takes birth, it will be born well.
 Wherever it lives, it will live well.
 It will keep on experiencing well-being and happiness until it gains the
 capacity, the potential, the accumulation of merit it has developed progressive
ly from the past into the present — in other words, yesterday is today's
 past, today is tomorrow's past, all of which are days in which we have
 fostered and developed goodness step by step — to the point where the mind
 has the firm strength and ability, from the supporting power of this goodness,
 that enables it to pass over and gain release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a mind has no more birth, not even in the most quiet or refined levels
 of being that contain any latent traces of conventional reality (sammati)
 — namely, birth and death as we currently experience it.
 Such a mind goes completely beyond all such things.
 Here I'm referring to the minds of the Buddhas and of the arahants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a story about Ven.
 Vangisa that has a bearing on this.
 Ven.
 Vangisa, when he was a layman, was very talented in divining the level
 of being in which the mind of a dead person was reborn — no matter who
 the person was.
 You couldn't quite say he was a fortuneteller.
 Actually he was more a master of psychic skills.
 When anyone died, he would take that person's skull and knock on it — knock!
 knock! knock! — focus his mind, and then know that this person was reborn
 there, that person was reborn here.
 If the person was reborn in hell or in heaven, as a common animal or a
 hungry ghost, he could tell in every case, without any hesitation.
 All he needed was to knock on the skull.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he heard his friends say that the Buddha was many times more talented
 than this, he wanted to expand on his knowledge.
 So he went to the Buddha's presence to ask for further training in this
 science.
 When he reached the Buddha, the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant
 to knock on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'All right, see if you can tell where he was reborn.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ven.
 Vangisa knocked on the skull and listened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knocked again and listened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thought for a moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He focused his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He couldn't see where the owner of the skull was reborn.
 At his wit's end, he confessed frankly that he didn't know where the arahant
 was reborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first, Ven.
 Vangisa had thought himself talented and smart, and had planned to challenge
 the Buddha before asking for further training.
 But when he reached the Buddha, the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant
 to knock on — and right there he was stymied.
 So now he genuinely wanted further training.
 Once he had further training, he'd really be something special.
 This being the way things stood, he asked to study with the Buddha.
 So the Buddha taught him the science, taught him the method — in other
 words, the science of the Dhamma.
 Ven.
 Vangisa practiced and practiced until finally he attained arahantship.
 From then on he was no longer interested in knocking on anyone's skull
 except for his own.
 Once he had known clearly, that was the end of the matter.
 This is called 'knocking on the right skull.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the Buddha had brought up the topic of the mind that doesn't experience
 rebirth — the skull of one whose mind was purified — no matter how many
 times Ven.
 Vangisa knocked on it, he couldn't know where the mind was reborn, even
 though he had been very talented before, for the place of a pure mind's
 rebirth cannot be found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same was true in the case of Ven.
 Godhika: This story should serve as quite some food for thought.
 Ven.
 Godhika went to practice meditation, made progress step by step, but then
 regressed.
 They say this happened six times.
 After the seventh time, he took a razor to slash his throat — he was so
 depressed — but then came to his senses, contemplated the Dhamma, and became
 an arahant at the last minute.
 That's the story in brief.
 When he died, Mara's hordes searched for his spirit.
 To put it simply, they stirred up a storm, but couldn't tell where he had
 been reborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the Lord Buddha said, 'No matter how much you dig or search or investigate
 to find the spirit of our son, Godhika, who has completely finished his
 task, you won't be able to find it — even if you turn the world upside
 down — because such a task lies beyond the scope of conventional reality.'
 How could they possibly find it? It's beyond the capacity of people with
 defilements to know the power of an arahant's mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the realm of convention, there is no one who can trace the path of an
 arahant's mind, because an arahant lies beyond convention, even though
 his is a mind just the same.
 Think about it: Even our stumbling and crawling mind, when it is continually
 cleansed without stop, without ceasing, without letting perseverance lag,
 will gradually become more and more refined until it reaches the limit
 of refinement.
 Then the refinement will disappear — because refinement is a matter of
 conventional reality — leaving a nature of solid gold, or solid Dhamma,
 called a pure mind.
 We too will then have no more problems, just like the arahants, because
 our mind will have become a superlative mind, just like the minds of those
 who have already gained release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All minds of this sort are the same, with no distinction between women and
 men, which is simply a matter of sex or convention.
 With the mind, there is no distinction between women and men, and thus
 both women and men have the same capacity in the area of the Dhamma.
 Both are capable of attaining the various levels of Dhamma all the way
 to release.
 There are no restrictions that can be imposed in this area.
 All that is needed is that we develop enough ability and potential, and
 then we can all go beyond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, we should all make an effort to train our hearts and minds.
 At the very least, we should get the mind to attain stillness and peace
 with any of the meditation themes that can lull it into a state of calm,
 giving rise to peace and well-being within it.
 For example, mindfulness of breathing, which is one of the primary themes
 in meditation circles, seems to suit the temperaments of more people than
 any other theme.
 But whatever the theme, take it as a governing principle, a refuge, a mainstay
 for the mind, putting it into practice within your own mind so as to attain
 rest and peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind begins to settle down, we will begin to see its essential
 nature and worth.
 We will begin to see what the heart is and how it is.
 In other words, when the mind gathers all of its currents into a single
 point, as simple awareness within itself, this is what is called the 'mind'
 (citta).
 The gathering in of the mind occurs on different levels, corresponding
 to the mind's ability and to the different stages of its refinement.
 Even if the mind is still on a crude level, we can nevertheless know it
 when it gathers inwardly.
 When the mind becomes more and more refined, we will know its refinement
 — 'This mind is refined...
 This mind is radiant...
 This mind is extremely still...
 This mind is something extremely amazing' — more and more, step by step,
 this very same mind!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cleansing and training the mind for the sake of stillness; in investigating,
 probing, and solving the problems of the mind with discernment (pañña)
 — which is the way of making the mind progress, or of enabling us to reach
 the truth of the mind, step by step, through the means already mentioned
 — no matter how crude the mind may be, don't worry about it.
 If we get down to making the effort and persevere continually with what
 diligence and persistence we have, that crudeness will gradually fade away
 and vanish.
 Refinement will gradually appear through our own actions or our own striving
 until we are able to go beyond and gain release by slashing the defilements
 to bits.
 This holds true for all of us, men and women alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But while we aren't yet able to do so, we shouldn't be anxious.
 All that is asked is that we make the mind principled so that it can be
 a refuge and a mainstay for itself.
 As for this body, we've been relying on it ever since the day we were born.
 This is something we all can know.
 We've made it live, lie down, urinate, defecate, work, make a living.
 We've used it, and it has used us.
 We order it around, and it orders us around.
 For instance, we've made it work, and it has made us suffer with aches
 here and pains there, so that we have to search for medicine to treat it.
 It's the one that hurts, and it's the one that searches for medicine.
 It's the one that provides the means.
 And so we keep supporting each other back and forth in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's hard to tell who is in charge, the body or us.
 We can order it around part of the time, but it orders us around all the
 time.
 Illness, hunger, thirst, sleepiness: These are all nothing but a heap of
 suffering and stress in which the body orders us around, and orders us
 from every side.
 We can order it around only a little bit, so when the time is right for
 us to give the orders, we should make it meditate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 Get to work.
 As long as the body is functioning normally, then no matter how much or
 how heavy the work, get right to it.
 But if the body isn't functioning normally, if you're ill, you need to
 be conscious of what it can take.
 As for the mind, though, keep up the effort within, unflaggingly, because
 it's your essential duty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You've depended on the body for a long time.
 Now that it's wearing down, know that it's wearing down — which parts still
 work, which parts no longer work.
 You're the one in charge and you know it full well, so make whatever compromise
s you should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as for the heart, which isn't ill along with the body, it should step
 up its efforts within, so that it won't lack the benefits it should gain.
 Make the mind have standards and be principled — principled in its living,
 principled in its dying.
 Wherever it's born, make it have good principles and satisfactory standards.
 What they call 'merit' (puñña) won't betray your hopes or expectations.
 It will provide you with satisfactory circumstances at all times, in keeping
 with the fact that you've accumulated the merit — the well-being — that
 all the world wants and of which no one has enough.
 In other words, what the world wants is well-being, whatever the sort,
 and in particular the well-being of the mind that will arise step by step
 from having done things, such as meditation, which are noble and good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the well-being that forms a core or an important essence within
 the heart.
 We should strive, then, while the body is still functioning, for when life
 comes to an end, nothing more can be done.
 No matter how little or how much we have accomplished, we must stop at
 that point.
 We stop our work, put it aside, and then reap its rewards — there, in the
 next life.
 Whatever we should be capable of doing, we do.
 If we can go beyond or gain release, that's the end of every problem.
 There will then be nothing to involve us in any turmoil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here I've been talking about the mind because the mind is the primary issue.
 That which will make us fare well or badly, meet with pleasure or pain,
 is nothing else but the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for what they call bad kamma, it lies within the mind that has made it.
 Whether or not you can remember, these seeds — which lie within the heart
 — can't be prevented from bearing fruit, because they are rooted in the
 mind.
 You have to accept your kamma.
 Don't find fault with it.
 Once it's done, it's done, so how can you find fault with it? The hand
 writes and so the hand must erase.
 You have to accept it like a good sport.
 This is the way it is with kamma until you can gain release — which will
 be the end of the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Marvel of the Dhamma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who practice the Dhamma will begin to know the Dhamma or to gain a
 feel for the Dhamma in the area of meditation more markedly than in other
 areas, and more extensively.
 For example, the gratification that comes from being generous is moving
 in one way, the gratification that comes from maintaining the precepts
 is moving in another way, the feelings of gratification that come from
 the different forms of goodness are moving in their own separate ways.
 This is called finding gratification in skillfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But all of these feelings of gratification converge in the practice of meditatio
n.
 We begin to feel moved from the moment the mind begins to grow still, when
 the heart gathers its currents together to stand solely on its own.
 Even though we may not yet obtain a great deal of stillness from the inward
 gathering of the mind, we still find ourselves gratified within, in a way
 we can clearly sense.
 If the mind or the Dhamma were a material object, there wouldn't be anyone
 in the world who wouldn't respect the religion, because the goodness, the
 well-being, and the marvels that arise from the religion and from the practicin
g in line with the teachings of the religion are things desired the world
 over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goodness, well-being, marvels: These are things the world has always desired
 from time immemorial — with a desire that has never lost its taste — and
 they are things that will always be desired until the world loses its meaning,
 or until people become extinct, having no more sense of good and evil.
 That's when the world will no longer aspire for these great blessings.
 The well-being that comes from the marvels — the Dhamma in the area of
 its results — is something to which all living beings aspire, simply that
 their abilities differ, so that some attain their aspirations, while others
 don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the Dhamma can't be displayed for the world to perceive with its senses
 of sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch in the way other things can.
 Even though there may be other immaterial phenomena similar to the Dhamma
 — such as smells — still they aren't like the true Dhamma that is touched
 by the hearts of those who have practiced it.
 If the Dhamma could be displayed like material objects, there is no doubt
 but that the human world would have to respect the religion for the sake
 of that Dhamma.
 This is because the Dhamma is something more marvelous than anything else.
 In all the three levels of existence, there is no greater marvel than in
 the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma can appear as a marvel, conspicuous and clear in the mind.
 The mind is what knows it — and only the mind.
 It can't be displayed in general like material objects, as when we take
 things out to admire or to show off to others.
 The Dhamma can't possibly be displayed like material objects.
 This is what makes the world lack interest — and lack the things that could
 be hoped from the Dhamma — in a way that is really a shame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even those who want the marvel of the Dhamma don't know what the marvel
 is, or what the profundity of the Dhamma is, because the mind has never
 had contact with that profundity.
 The eye has never had contact with the marvel.
 The ear has never obtained any marvel from the current of the Dhamma, because
 the Dhamma can't be displayed as a current of sound as other things can.
 This is one obstacle that prevents people from becoming moved by the Dhamma,
 that prevents them from fully believing and fully entrusting themselves
 to the Dhamma in a way consistent with the world's long-felt hunger for
 well-being and prosperity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the Buddhas who has gained Awakening and taught the Dhamma to the
 world has had to reflect to the full extent of his intelligence and ability
 on the myriad ways of teaching the Dhamma to the world so that the world
 could see it as a marvel, inasmuch as the Dhamma can't be put in shop windows
 or in public places.
 This is because the true Dhamma lies in the heart and reveals itself only
 in words and deeds, which doesn't excite a gratifying sense of absorption
 in the same way as touching the Dhamma directly with the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because there is no way to display the Dhamma directly, the Buddhas display
 it indirectly through teaching.
 They point out the causes — the Dhamma of conduct and practices leading
 to the Dhamma of results at this or that point or this or that level; and
 at the same time they proclaim the results — the excellence, the marvels
 of the stages and levels of the Dhamma that can be touched with the heart,
 all the way to the highest marvel, vimutti, the mental release called nibbana
 within the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every Buddha has to devise strategies in teaching the Dhamma so as to bring
 that marvel out to the world by using various modes of speech and conduct
 — for example, describing the Dhamma and showing the conduct of the Dhamma
 as being like this and that — but the actual Dhamma can't be shown.
 It is something known exclusively in the heart, in the way in which each
 Buddha and each arahant possesses this marvel.
 None of the Buddhas, none of the arahants who possess this marvel are in
 any way deficient in this regard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marvel lies in their hearts — simply that they can't take the marvel
 that appears there and display it in the full measure of its wonder.
 Thus they devise strategies for displaying it in their actions, which are
 simply attributes of the Dhamma, not the actual Dhamma itself.
 For instance, the doctrine they teach in the texts is simply an attribute
 of the Dhamma.
 Their act of teaching is also just an attribute of the Dhamma.
 The actual Dhamma is when a meditator or a person who listens to their
 teachings about the Dhamma follows the Dhamma in practice and touches it
 stage by stage within his or her own heart.
 This is called beginning to make contact with the actual Dhamma, step by
 step.
 However much contact is made, it gives a sense of gratification felt exclusivel
y within the heart of the person who has gained that contact through his
 or her own practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it comes to ingenuity in teaching, no one excels the Buddhas.
 Even so, they reveal only what they see as appropriate for humanity.
 They can't reveal the actual Dhamma — for example, by taking out the true
 marvel in their hearts and unfolding it for the world to see, saying, 'This
 is the marvel of the Tathagata, of each Buddha.
 Do you see it?' This can't be done, for here we're talking about the marvel
 of the purity of a heart that was previously swamped with defilement like
 a heap of assorted excrement, but now has become a pure, unsullied nature,
 or a pure, amazing nature because of the practice of constantly and relentlessl
y cleansing it.
 They can't show that Dhamma to the world, saying, 'Do you see this? Look
 at it.
 Look at it.
 Feast your eyes till they're full and then strive to make this treasure
 your own!' So instead, they teach by using various strategies for those
 who practice, describing the path in full detail, in terms both of causes
 and of results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What they bring out to show is simply the current of their voices, the breath
 of their mouths.
 That's what they bring out to speak, simply the breath of their mouths.
 They can't bring out the real thing.
 For example, when they say, 'It's marvelous like this,' it's just sound.
 The marvelous nature itself can't be brought out.
 All they can bring out is the action of saying, 'That nature is marvelous,'
 so that we can speculate for ourselves as to what that marvel is like.
 Even though this doesn't remove our doubts, it's better than if we had
 never heard about it at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the basic principle in making us come to know and see the marvel of
 the Dhamma is that first we have to speculate and then we follow with practice.
 This qualifies as following the principles of the Dhamma the Buddha taught,
 and this is fitting and proper.
 No matter what the difficulties and hardships encountered in following
 the path, we shouldn't let them form barriers to our progress, because
 this is where the path lies.
 There are no other byways that can take us easily to the goal.
 If our practice is difficult, we have to stick with it.
 If it's painful, we have to bear it, because it's a duty we have to perform,
 a burden we have to carry while working so as to attain our aims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma of a pure mind is like this: The mind is the Dhamma, the Dhamma
 is the mind.
 We call it a mind only as long as it is still with the body and khandhas.
 Only then can we call it a pure mind, the mind of a Buddha, or the mind
 of an arahant.
 After it passes from the body and khandhas, there is no conventional reality
 to which it can be compared, and so we can't call it anything at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No matter how marvelous that nature, no matter how much it may be ours,
 there is no possible way we can use conventional realities to describe
 it or to make comparisons, because that Dhamma, that realm of release,
 has no conventions against which to measure things or make comparisons.
 It's the same as if we were in outer space: Which way is north, which way
 is south, we don't know.
 If we're on Earth, we can say 'east,' 'west,' 'north,' and 'south' because
 there are things that we can observe and compare so as to tell which direction
 lies which way.
 We take the Earth as our standard.
 'High' and 'low' depend on the Earth as their frame of reference.
 How much higher than this, lower than this, north of this, south of this:
 These things we can say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if we're out in outer space, there is no standard by which we can measure
 things, and so we can't say.
 Or as when we go up in an airplane: We can't tell how fast or how slow
 we're going.
 When we pass a cloud, we can tell that we're going fast, but if we depend
 simply on our eyesight, we're sure to think that the speed of the airplane
 is nowhere near the speed of a car.
 We can clearly see how deceptive our eyesight is in just this way.
 When we ride in a car, the trees on both sides of the road look as if they
 were falling in together down on the road behind us.
 Actually, they stay their separate selves.
 It's simply that the car runs past them.
 Since there are things that we sense, that lie close enough for comparison,
 it seems as if the car were going really fast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the airplane, there's nothing to make comparisons with, so it looks
 as if the plane were dawdling along, as if it were going slower than a
 car, even though it's actually many times faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how it is when we compare the mind of an ordinary run-of-the-mill
 person with the mind of the Buddha.
 Whatever the Buddha says is good and excellent, we ordinary people tend
 to say that it's not.
 Whatever we like, no matter how vile, we say that it's good.
 We don't admit the truth, in the same way as thinking that a car goes faster
 than an airplane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practice of attending to the mind is something very important.
 Try to develop mindfulness (sati) and discernment so that they can keep
 up with the things that come and entangle the mind.
 By and large, the heart itself is the instigator, creating trouble continually,
 relentlessly.
 We then fall for the preoccupations the heart turns out — and this makes
 us agitated, upset, and saddened, all because of the thoughts formed by
 the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These come from the heart itself, and the heart itself is what falls for
 them, saying that this is this, and that is that, even though the things
 it names 'this' and 'that' merely exist in line with their nature.
 They have no meaning in and of themselves, that they are like ''this' or
 'that.' The mind simply gives them meanings, and then falls for its own
 meanings, making itself glad or sad over those things without end.
 Thus the stress and suffering that result from thought-formations have
 no end, no point of resolution, just as if we were floating adrift in the
 middle of the sea waiting to breathe our last breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddhas all reached Awakening here in this human world because the human
 world is rich in the Noble Truths.
 It's where they are plain to see.
 The Noble Truth of stress (dukkha) lies in the human body.
 Human beings know about stress — because they're smarter than common animals.
 The Noble Truth of the origin of stress: This lies in the human heart.
 The Noble Truth of the path — the path of practice to cure defilement (kilesa),
 craving (tanha), and mental effluents (asava), which are the things that
 produce stress: This, human beings also know.
 What is the path? To put it briefly: virtue, concentration, and discernment.
 These things human beings know and can put into practice.
 The Noble Truth of the cessation of stress: This, human beings also know.
 No matter which of these truths, all human beings know them — although
 they may not know how to behave toward them or take interest in behaving
 in line with them, in which case there is no way the Dhamma can help them
 at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddhas thus taught the Dhamma in the human world, because the human
 world lies in the center of all the levels of existence.
 We have been born in the center of existence, in the midst of the religion.
 We should conform correctly to the central point of the religion, so as
 to comprehend the religion's teachings that lie in the center of our heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The superlative Dhamma lies right here.
 It doesn't lie anywhere else.
 The mind is what can reach the Dhamma.
 The mind is what knows all dhammas.
 The affairs of the Dhamma, then, do not lie beyond the mind, which is a
 fitting vessel for them.
 Good, evil, pleasure, pain: The mind knows these things before anything
 else knows them, so we should develop mindfulness and discernment to be
 resourceful, to keep up with the events that are always becoming involved
 with the mind in the course of each day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we're intent on investigating the origin of stress, which fans out from
 our various thought-formations, we will find that it arises without stop.
 It arises right here in the mind.
 It's fashioned right here.
 Even though we try to make it quiet, it won't be still.
 Why? Because of the 'unquietness', the thoughts with which the mind disturbs
 itself, which it forms and sends out towards its preoccupations (arammana)
 all the time.
 Once the mind sends out its thoughts, it then gathers in stress for itself.
 It keeps at it, in and out like this.
 What goes out is the origin of stress, and what comes back in is stress.
 In other words, thoughts form and go out as the origin of stress, and when
 the results come back to the heart, they're stressful.
 These things are constantly being manufactured like this all the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we want the mind to have even just a little bit of calm, we really
 have to force it; and even then these things still manage to drive the
 mind into forming thoughts whenever we let down our guard.
 This is how it is with the origin of stress, which is constantly producing
 suffering.
 It lies in the heart and is always arising.
 For this reason, we must use mindfulness and discernment to diagnose and
 remedy the origin of stress, to keep an eye out for it, and to snuff it
 out right there, without being negligent.
 Wherever we sit or stand — whatever our activity — we keep watch over this
 point, with mindfulness alert to it, and discernment unraveling it so as
 to know it constantly for what it truly is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All those who practice to remove defilement practice in this way.
 In particular, those who are ordained practice by going into the forest
 to look for a place conducive to their striving in order to wipe out this
 very enemy.
 Even when they stay in inhabited areas, or wherever they go, wherever they
 stay, they keep their attention focused continually, step by step, on the
 persistent effort to remove and demolish the origin of stress, which is
 a splinter, a thorn in the heart.
 Such people are bound to develop more and more ease and well-being, step
 by step, in proportion to the persistence of their striving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see clearly when the mind is still and settles down: Thought-formations
 are still, or don't exist.
 Turmoil and disturbances don't occur.
 The stress that would otherwise result doesn't appear.
 When the mind is quiet, stress is also quiet.
 When thought-formations are quiet, the origin of stress is also quiet.
 Stress is also quiet.
 All that remains at that moment is a feeling of peace and ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The war between the mind and the defilements causing stress is like this.
 We have to keep fighting with persistence.
 We have to use mindfulness and discernment, conviction and persistence
 to contend with the war that disturbs and ravages the mind, making it stagger
 and reel within.
 The disturbances will then gradually be suppressed.
 Even when there is only a moment of quiet, we will come to see the harm
 of the thought-formations that are constantly disturbing us.
 At the same time, we will see the benefits of mental stillness — that it's
 a genuine pleasure.
 Whether there is a lot of stillness or a little, pleasure arises in proportion
 to the foundation of stillness or the strength of the stillness, which
 in the texts is called samadhi, or concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mind centered and still is called a mind in concentration, or a mind gathered
 in concentration.
 This is what genuine concentration is like inside the heart.
 The names of the various stages of concentration are everywhere, but actual
 concentration is inside the heart.
 The heart is what gives rise to concentration.
 It produces it, makes it on its own.
 When concentration is still, the mind experiences cool respite and pleasure.
 It has its own foundation set firmly and solidly within.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's as if we were under an eave or under the cooling shade of a tree.
 We're comfortable when it rains, we're comfortable when the sun is out,
 because we don't have to be exposed to the sun and rain.
 The same holds true with a mind that has an inner foundation of stillness:
 It's not affected by this preoccupation or that, which would otherwise
 disturb and entangle it repeatedly, without respite.
 This is because stillness is the heart's dwelling — 'concentration,' which
 is one level of home for the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment (pañña) is ingenuity, sound judgment, evaluating causes and
 effects within and without; above, below, and in between — inside the body
 — all the way to the currents of the mind that send out thoughts from various
 angles.
 Mindfulness and discernment keep track of these things, investigating and
 evaluating them so as to know causes and effects in terms of the heart's
 thought-formations, or in terms of the nature of sankhara within us, until
 we see the truth of each of these things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't go investigating these things off target, by being clever with labels
 and interpretations that go against the truth — because in the investigation
 of phenomena, we investigate in line with the truth.
 We don't resist the truth, for that wouldsimply enhance the defilements
 causing stress at the very moment we think we're investigating phenomena
 so as to remove them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Birth we have already experienced.
 As for old age, we've been growing old from the day of our birth, older
 and older, step by step.
 Whatever our age, that's how long we've been growing old, until we reach
 the end of life.
 When we're old to the nth degree, we fall apart.
 In other words, we've been growing old from the moment of birth — older
 by the day, the month, the year — older and older continually.
 We call it 'growing up', but actually it's growing old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See? Investigate it for what it really is.
 This is the great highway — the way of nature.
 Don't resist it.
 For example, the body is growing old, but we don't want it to be old.
 We want it always to be young.
 This is called resisting the truth — which is stress.
 Even when we try to resist it, we don't get anywhere.
 What do we hope to gain by resisting it and creating stress for ourselves?
 Actually, we gain nothing but the stress that comes from resisting the
 truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use discernment to investigate just like this.
 Whenever pain arises in any part of the body, if we have medicine to treat
 it, then we treat it.
 When the medicine can take care of it, the body recovers.
 When the medicine can't, it dies.
 It goes on its own.
 There's no need for us to force it not to die, or to stay alive for so-and-so
 many years, for that would be an absurdity.
 Even if we forced it, it wouldn't stay.
 We wouldn't get any results and would just be wearing ourselves out in
 vain.
 The body has to follow its own natural principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we investigate in line with its truth this way, we can be at our ease.
 Wherever there's pain, keep aware of it continually in line with its truth.
 Whether it hurts a lot or a little, keep aware of its manifestations until
 it reaches the ultimate point of pain — the death of the body — and that's
 as far as it goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Know it in line with its truth.
 Don't resist it.
 Don't set up any desires, because the setting up of desire is a deficiency,
 a hunger.
 And hunger, no matter when or what the sort, is pain: Hunger for sleep
 is pain, hunger for food is pain, hunger for water is pain.
 When was it ever a good thing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hunger, the desires that arise, wanting things to be like this, wanting
 them to be like that: These are all nothing but disturbances, issues that
 give rise to stress and pain.
 This is why the Buddha doesn't have us resist the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use your discernment to investigate, to contemplate in line with the natural
 principles of things as they already are.
 This is called discernment that doesn't fly in the face of truth — and
 the heart can then be at ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We study the four 'Noble Truths' here in our body.
 In other words, we study birth, aging, illness, and death, all of which
 lie in this single heap of elements (dhatu) without ever leaving it.
 Birth is an affair of these elements.
 Growing up or growing old, it's old right here.
 When there's illness, it manages to be ill right here, in one part or another.
 When death comes, it dies right here.
 So we have to study right here — where else would we study? We have to
 study and know the things that involve us directly before we study anything
 else.
 We have to study them comprehensively and to completion — studying our
 own birth, our aging, our illness and pain, and completing our study of
 our own death.
 That's when we'll be wise — wise to all the events around us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People who know the Dhamma through practicing so that they are wise to the
 events that occur to themselves, do not flinch in the face of any of the
 conventional realities of the world at all.
 This is how it is when we study the Dhamma, when we know and see the Dhamma
 in the area of the heart — in other words, when we know rightly and well.
 'Mindfulness and discernment that are wise all around themselves' are wise
 in this way, not wise simply from being able to remember.
 They have to be wise in curing doubt, in curing the recalcitrance of the
 heart, as well as in curing their own attachments and false assumptions
 so as to leave only a nature that is pure and simple.
 That's when we'll be really at ease, really relieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let the khandhas be khandhas pure and simple in their own way, without our
 messing with them, without our struggling with them for power, without
 our forcing or coercing them to be like this or like that.
 The khandhas are then khandhas, the mind is then the mind, each with its
 own separate reality, each not infringing on the others as it used to.
 Each performs its own duties.
 This is called khandhas pure and simple, the mind pure and simple, without
 any conventional realities adulterating them.
 What knows is what knows, the elements are elements, the khandhas are khandhas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever things may break apart, let them break apart.
 We have already known them clearly with our discernment.
 We have no doubts.
 We've known them in advance, even before they die, so when death comes,
 what doubts can we have? — especially now that they display the truth of
 their nature for us to see clearly.
 This is called studying the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma.
 To study and practice this way is to follow the same way that sages have
 practiced and known before us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these conditions are matters of conventional reality — matters of
 the elements, the khandhas, or the sense media (ayatana).
 The four khandhas, the five khandhas, whatever, are individual conditions,
 individual conditions that are separated in line with conventions.
 Discernment is also a condition; and mindfulness, another condition — condition
s of the heart — but they're Dhamma, means of curing the mind that is clouded
 and obscured, means of washing away the things that cloud and obscure it,
 until radiance appears through the power of the discernment that cleanses
 the heart.
 Once the heart is radiant, in the next step it becomes pure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is it pure? Because all impurities have fallen away from it.
 The various misconstruings that are an affair of defilement are all gone
 from the heart, so the heart is pure.
 This pure heart means that we have completed our study of ourselves, in
 line with the statement of the teaching:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
vusitam brahmacariyam katam karaniyam: 'The task of the religion is done,
 the holy life is complete, there is no further task to be done.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the tasks we have had to do — abandoning and striving — are done to
 completion, we know right here, because delusion lay right here in the
 heart.
 We study and practice simply to cure our own delusion.
 Once we know right here, and delusion is gone, what else is there to know?
 — for beyond this there is nothing further to know.
 What else is there for us to be deluded about? We're no longer deluded,
 because we know fully all around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This very state of mind: When at the beginning I referred to the superlative
 Dhamma, the marvelous Dhamma, I was referring to this very state of mind,
 this very Dhamma — but it's something known exclusively within itself,
 and exists only within itself.
 It's marvelous — this we know within our own mind.
 It's superlative — this we also know within our own mind.
 We can't take it out or unfurl it like other things for other people to
 see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if you want to have any Noble Treasures to show for yourself, practice.
 Remove all those dirty stains from the heart, and the superlative things
 I have mentioned will appear by their own nature — in other words, they
 will appear in the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is called completing your study of the Dhamma; and your study of the
 world is completed right here.
 The 'world' means the world of elements, the world of the khandhas that
 lie right here with each of us, which are more important than the worlds
 of elements and khandhas belonging to other people, because this world
 of elements and khandhas lies with us and has been weighing on the heart
 all along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have studied the Dhamma to the attainment of release, that's all
 there is to study.
 We've studied the world to completion and studied the Dhamma in full.
 Our doubts are gone, and there is nothing that will ever make us doubt
 again.
 As the Buddha exclaimed, 'When dhammas become apparent to the Brahman,
 earnest and absorbed, doubt comes to an end because the conditions, the
 factors for continued being and birth, come to an end.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have reached this level, we can live wherever we like.
 The war is ended — the war between the mind and defilement, or the war
 between Dhamma and defilement, is over.
 This is where we dismantle being and birth.
 This is where we dismantle the heap of suffering in the round of rebirth
 — right here in the heart.
 Since the heart is the wanderer through the cycle of rebirth, we have to
 dismantle things right here, to know them right here.
 Once we know, that's the end of all problems right here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this whole wide world there are no problems.
 The only problem was the issue of the heart that was deluded about itself
 and about the things that became involved with it.
 Now that it has completely rectified the way it is involved with things,
 there is nothing left — and that's the end of the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this point on, there are no more problems to trouble the heart until
 the day of its total nibbana.
 This is how the Dhamma is studied to completion.
 The world — the world of elements and khandhas — is studied to completion
 right here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So keep striving in order to see the marvel described at the beginning,
 which was described in line with the truth with no aspect to invite any
 doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha and the Noble Disciples have Dhamma filling their hearts to the
 brim.
 You are a disciple of the Tathagata, with a mind that can be made to show
 its marvelousness through the practice of making it pure, just like the
 Buddha and the Noble Disciples.
 So try to make it still and radiant, because the heart has long lain buried
 in the mud.
 As soon as you can see the harm of the mud and grow tired of it, you should
 urgently wake up, take notice, and exert yourself till you can manage to
 make your way free.
 Nibbana is holding its hand out, waiting for you.
 Aren't you going to come out?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rebelliousness is simply distraction.
 The end of rebelliousness is stillness.
 When the heart is still, it's at ease.
 If it's not still, it's as hot as fire.
 Wherever you are, everything is hot and troubled.
 Once it is still, then it's cool and peaceful wherever you are — cool right
 here in the heart.
 So make the heart cool with the practice, because the heat and trouble
 lie with the heart.
 The heat of fire is one thing, but the heat of a troubled heart is hotter
 than fire.
 Try to put out the fires of defilement, craving, and mental effluents burning
 here in the heart, so that only the phenomenon of genuine Dhamma remains.
 Then you will be cool and at peace, everywhere and always.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so I'll ask to stop here.

\begin_layout Standard
The Prison World vs.
 the World Outside
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our mind, if we were to make a comparison with the world, is a perpetual
 prisoner, like a person born in jail who lives in jail, behind bars, with
 no chance to get out to see the outside world — someone who has grown from
 childhood to adulthood entirely in a prison cell and so doesn't know what
 there is outside; someone who has seen pleasure and pain only in the prison
 and has never been out to see what kind of pleasure, comfort, and freedom
 they have in the outside world.
 We have no way of knowing what kind of happiness and enjoyment they have
 there in the outside world, how they come and go, how they live, because
 we are kept in prison from the day we are born until the day we die.
 This is a comparison, an analogy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have only the pleasure and pain that the prison has to offer, with nothing
 special, nothing obtained from the outside world so that when it enters
 the prison we could see that, 'This is something different from the prison
 world — this is from the outside world, outside the prison;' so that we
 could make comparisons and know that, 'This is like this, that is like
 that; this is better than that, that is better than this.' There is nothing
 but the affairs of the prison.
 However much the pleasure and pain, however great the deprivations, the
 difficulties, the oppression and coercion, that's simply the way it's been
 all along from the very beginning — and so we don't know where to look
 for a way out or how to free ourselves.
 We don't even know where the outside world is, because we have seen only
 the inside world: the prison where we have always been locked away, oppressed,
 starved, beaten, tortured, deprived.
 Even our bedding, food, belongings — everything of every sort — is like
 that of a prisoner in jail.
 And yet people like this can still live this way because they have never
 seen enough of the outside world to be able to make comparisons as to which
 is better, which is more pleasant, in order to feel inclined to search
 for a way out to the outside world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mind controlled by the power of defilement and mental effluents is like
 this.
 It has been imprisoned by various kinds of defilement for aeons and aeons.
 For example, in our present lifetime, the defilements that hold sway over
 the hearts of living beings have been with us since the day of our birth.
 They have kept us in continual custody, never giving us any freedom within
 ourselves at all.
 For this reason, we have difficulty imagining what sort of pleasure there
 could be above and beyond the way things are, just like a person who was
 born and has always lived in a prison.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What sort of world is the world outside? Is it a good place to visit? A
 good place to live? The Dhamma proclaims it loud and clear, but hardly
 anyone is interested.
 Still, there are fortunately some places where some people are interested.
 In places where no one proclaims it, where no one speaks of what the outside
 world — a mind with Dhamma in charge — is like, no one knows what the teachings
 of the religion are like.
 No one knows what the happiness that comes from the Dhamma is like.
 Such people are so surrounded by darkness, so completely drowned in attachment,
 that not even a single limb shows above the surface, because there is no
 religion to pull them out.
 It's as if the outside world didn't exist.
 They have nothing but the prison, the defilements, holding the heart in
 custody.
 Born in this world, they have only the prison as their place to live and
 to die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mind that has never known what could give it greater pleasure, comfort,
 and freedom than it has at present, if we were to make a different comparison,
 is like a duck playing in a mud puddle under a shanty.
 It keeps playing there: splat, splat, splat, splat, splat.
 No matter how dirty or filthy it is, it's content to play because it has
 never seen the water of the ocean, of a river, of a lake or a pond large
 enough for it to swim and immerse its entire body with ease.
 It has known only the mud puddle that lies stagnant under the shanty, into
 which things in the shanty get washed down.
 And so it plays there, thinking it's fun, swimming happily in its way —
 why? Because it has never seen water wider or deeper than that, enough
 to give it more enjoyment in coming and going or swimming around than it
 can find in the mud puddle under the shanty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for ducks that live along broad, deep canals, they're very different
 from the duck under the shanty.
 They really enjoy themselves along rivers, lakes, canals, and ponds.
 Wherever their owner herds them, there they go — crossing back and forth
 over highways and byways, spreading in flocks of hundreds and thousands.
 Even ducks like these have their happiness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do they stand for?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They stand for the mind.
 A mind that has never seen the pleasure, the comfort, the enjoyment that
 comes from the Dhamma is like the duck playing in the mud puddle under
 the shanty, or those that enjoy swimming in canals, rivers, or lakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We at present have our pleasure and happiness through the controlling power
 of the defilements, which is like the happiness of prisoners in jail.
 When the mind receives training from the outside world — meaning the Dhamma
 that comes from the transcendent (lokuttara) Dhammas, from the 'land' of
 nibbana on down, level by level to the human world, revealing every level,
 every realm — we find that those of us who are inclined, who are interested
 in the outside world, in happiness greater than that which exists at present,
 still exist.
 When we hear the Dhamma step by step, or read books about the outside world
 — about Dhamma, about releasing ourselves from the pain and suffering we
 are forced to undergo within our hearts — our minds feel pleasure and enjoyment.
 Interest.
 A desire to listen.
 A desire to practice so as to reap the results step by step.
 This is where we begin to see the influence of the outside world making
 itself felt.
 The heart begins to exert itself, trying to free itself from the tyranny
 and oppression from within, like that of a prisoner in jail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more so, when we practice in the area of the mind: The more peace we
 obtain, then the greater the effort, the greater the exertion we make.
 Mindfulness and discernment gradually appear.
 We see the harm of the tyranny and the oppression imposed by the defilements
 in the heart.
 We see the value of the Dhamma, which is a means of liberation.
 The more it frees us, the more ease we feel in the heart.
 Respite.
 Relief.
 This then is a means of increasing our conviction in ascending stages,
 and of increasing our effort and stamina in its wake.
 The mindfulness and discernment that used to lie buried in the mud gradually
 revive and awaken, and begin to contemplate and investigate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the past, no matter what assaulted us by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue,
 body, or mind, we were like dead people.
 We held these things to be ordinary and normal.
 They never provoked our mindfulness and discernment to investigate and
 explore, searching for beginnings and ends, causes and effects.
 Even though these things had been our enemies for a long, long time, making
 their assaults both day and night, we were never interested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, however, we develop an interest.
 When the heart begins to enter the current of the Dhamma in which it has
 been trained to the point of developing a basis for mindfulness and discernment
, step by step, it is bound to see clearly both what is beneficial and what
 is harmful, because these things dwell together — benefits and harm — within
 this heart.
 The mind develops agility in contemplating and investigating.
 The heart develops boldness in its explorations.
 Seeing harm, it tries to remedy it.
 Seeing benefits, it tries to open the way for them; it tries to foster
 them in ascending stages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is called the mind gradually gaining release from tyranny and oppression
 — the prison — within.
 At the same time, it is gaining a view of the outside world, seeing what
 sort of world it is, seeing whether it's like the prison that exists at
 present.
 Our eyes can see the outside world to some extent, can see how those in
 the outside world live, how they come and go — and what about us in the
 prison? What is it like to live overcome by defilements? How does the mind
 feel as we gain gradual relief from the defilements? We can begin to make
 comparisons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now at last we have an outside world and an inside world to compare! The
 happiness and ease that come from removing however many of the defilements
 we can remove, appear.
 The stress that continues as long as the remaining defilements still exert
 their influence, we know clearly.
 We see their harm with our discernment on its various levels and we try
 continually to remedy the situation without letting our persistence lapse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is when mindfulness, discernment, conviction, and persistence stir
 themselves out to the front lines: when we see both the outside world —
 however much we have been able to liberate the heart from defilement —
 and the inside world, where the defilements keep up their oppression and
 coercion.
 Before, we never knew what to use for comparisons, because we had never
 seen anything other than this.
 Because we were born buried in pain and suffering this way, no pleasure
 from the outside world — from the Dhamma — ever appeared to us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What did appear was the kind of happiness that had suffering behind the
 scenes, waiting to stomp in and obliterate that happiness without giving
 a moment's notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, however, we are beginning to know and see.
 We see the happiness of the outside, that is, of the outside world, of
 those who have Dhamma reigning in their hearts; and we see the happiness
 inside the prison, the happiness that lies under the influence of defilement.
 We also see the suffering and stress that lie under the influence of defilement.
 We know this all clearly with our own mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The happiness that comes from the outside world — in other words, from the
 current of the Dhamma seeping deep into the heart — we begin to see, step
 by step, enough to make comparisons.
 We see the outside world, the inside world, their benefits and drawbacks.
 When we take them and compare them, we gain an ever greater understanding
 — plus greater persistence, greater stamina — to the point that when anything
 connected with defilement that used to tyrannize and oppress the mind passes
 our way, we immediately feel called upon to tackle it, remedy it, strip
 it away, and demolish it step by step through the power of mindfulness
 and discernment backed by persistent effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind will set itself spinning.
 When its awareness of harm is great, its appreciation of what is beneficial
 is also great.
 When the desire to know and see the Dhamma is great, when the desire to
 gain release is great, persistence will have to become greater in their
 wake.
 Stamina and resilience will also come in their wake, because they all exist
 in the same heart.
 When we see harm, the entire heart is what sees it.
 When we see benefits, the entire heart is what sees.
 When we try to make our way with various methods in line with our abilities,
 it's an affair of the entire heart making the effort to free itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why these things, such as persistence, that are the mind's tools,
 the mind's support, come together.
 For example, saddha, conviction in the paths (magga) and their fruitions
 (phala), conviction in the realm beyond suffering and stress; viriya, persisten
ce, perseverance in gaining release for oneself step by step; khanti, stamina,
 endurance in order to be unyielding in passing over and beyond: All of
 these things come together.
 Mindfulness and discernment, contemplating along the way, seeing what is
 right and what is wrong, will come in their wake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to speak in terms of the principles of the formal Dhamma as expressed
 by the Buddha, this is called the path converging (magga-samangi), gradually
 gathering itself into this single heart.
 Everything comes together: Right View, Right Resolve, Right Speech, Right
 Action, all the way to Right Concentration, all come gathering into this
 single heart.
 They don't go anywhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Action: Our only right undertakings are sitting and walking meditation,
 because we have reached the stage of precision work where the heart gathers
 together.
 The mind is in a state of the path converging — gathering itself into a
 single heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right View, Right Resolve: These refer to the concerns of discernment, always
 exploring the affairs of the elements, the khandhas, whatever appears or
 makes contact, arises and vanishes, whether good or evil, past or future,
 appearing in the heart.
 Mindfulness and discernment slash these things to bits step by step without
 bothering to waste time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Action: On the level of the body, this refers to doing sitting and
 walking meditation, making the effort to abandon the defilements no matter
 what our posture.
 On the level of the heart, this refers to persistence within the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Speech: We speak only of the Dhamma.
 Our conversation deals only with the topics of effacement (sallekha-dhamma),
 topics of polishing away or washing away defilements and mental effluents
 from the heart, telling what methods we can use that will utterly end the
 defilements: This is Right Speech.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Livelihood: When the heart feeds on any object that's its enemy, this
 is called maintaining a wrong livelihood.
 Since the object is an enemy of the heart, the heart will have to be clouded.
 There's nothing good about it at all.
 It has to lead to greater or lesser amounts of suffering and stress within
 the heart in proportion to the heart's crudeness or refinement.
 This is called poison.
 Wrong livelihood.
 We have to correct it immediately.
 Immediately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any mental object that's rightful, that leads to happiness, well-being,
 and ease, is a fitting preoccupation, a fitting food for the heart, providing
 it with peace and well-being.
 This is how Right Livelihood is maintained with Dhamma on the ascending
 levels of training the heart.
 As for Right Livelihood on the physical level, dealing with food or alms,
 that applies universally for Buddhists in general to conduct themselves
 in line with their personal duties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Effort: What sort of effort? This we know.
 The Buddha taught four kinds of effort: (1) Try to be careful not to let
 evil arise within yourself.
 (2) Try to abandon evil that has already arisen.
 In being careful not to let evil arise, we have to be careful by being
 mindful.
 Using mindfulness in trying not to let evil arise means being alert to
 the mind that thinks and wanders about, gathering suffering and stress
 into itself.
 This is because thought-formations of the wrong sort are the origin of
 stress, and so we should be careful to guard against them.
 Don't be careless or complacent.
 (3) Try to develop what is skillful — intelligence — so as to increase
 it step by step.
 (4) Try to safeguard the skillful things that have arisen so as to develop
 them even further and not let them deteriorate.
 All of these right exertions apply right within us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Mindfulness keeps watch over the heart.
 Mindfulness and self-awareness keep constant track of its behavior and
 activities.
 Whatever makes contact by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, or body, if
 it doesn't go into the heart, where does it go? The heart is an enormous
 place, always ready to be informed of various things, both good and evil.
 Discernment is what contemplates and deliberates.
 Mindfulness is what keeps vigilant, inspecting whatever comes in to engage
 the heart.
 Whatever the preoccupation, good or evil, mindfulness and discernment contempla
te and are selective of what engages the heart.
 Whatever they see as improper, the mind will reject immediately.
 Immediately.
 Discernment is what makes the rejection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right Concentration: Our work for the sake of making the defilements quiet
 through concentration is steady and constant, to the point where the results
 appear as peace and calm in the heart, as a true place of rest without
 any distractions coming in to disturb the heart at that moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering concentration so as to relax the mind, in order to give strength
 to discernment in its continuing explorations, you should go ahead and
 really rest — rest in concentration.
 Enter the calm.
 Completely stop all thoughts and explorations in the area of discernment.
 Let the mind settle in and relax.
 It doesn't have to think or contrive anything at all related to its work.
 Let the mind rest comfortably by giving it a single preoccupation.
 If the mind happens to be extremely engrossed in its investigations so
 that you can't rein it in, use 'buddho' as a means to drag it in.
 Make the mind stay with 'buddho, buddho, buddho.' Even though the meditation
 word 'buddho' may be a mental contrivance, it's a contrivance in a single
 focal idea.
 Contriving a single focal idea can cause the mind to settle down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if while we are repeating, 'buddho, buddho, buddho,' the mind
 flashes back to its work because it is engrossed in its unfinished business,
 we should repeat the meditation word even faster so as not to let the mind
 go back to its work.
 In other words, when the mind is at the stage where it is engrossed in
 its work, we could say — to put it in worldly terms — that we can't let
 down our guard, although on this level it's hard to say that the mind lets
 down its guard.
 To get nearer the truth, we should say that we can't loosen our grip.
 To put it simply, we can't loosen our grip.
 Otherwise the mind will jump back out to work.
 So at this point we have to be firm with our meditation word.
 Force the mind to stay with its single preoccupation — 'buddho' — as a
 means of reining the mind in.
 Repeat 'buddho, buddho, buddho' in really close frequency; then 'buddho'
 and the mind will become one.
 The heart will be firm and calm down, calm down, relaxing, relaxing, setting
 aside all its work.
 The mind will become cool and peaceful.
 This is Right Concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the time comes to rest, you have to rest like this for it to qualify
 as Right Concentration.
 When you've had enough, when you see that the mind has regained strength,
 then simply let go — that's all — and the mind will spring immediately
 back to work.
 It springs out of oneness, of having a single preoccupation, and returns
 to being two with its work.
 At this point, the heart gets back to work without worrying about concentration
 while it is working.
 In the same way, when centering the mind for the sake of stillness, you
 don't have to worry about your work at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When resting, you have to rest, in the same way that when eating you don't
 have to do any work at all except for the work of eating.
 When sleeping, sleep peacefully.
 You shouldn't be concerned with any work at all.
 But once you have begun work, you shouldn't concern yourself with eating
 and sleeping.
 Really set your mind on your work.
 This is called doing a solid piece of work: work in its proper phases,
 work at the proper time, in keeping with events, 'Right Action,' work that
 doesn't overstep its boundaries, appropriate work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practice of centering the mind is something you can't neglect.
 In practicing for the sake of the heart's happiness, the view that centering
 the mind, keeping still, serves no purpose is wrong.
 If someone is addicted to concentration, unwilling to come out and work,
 that's improper and should be criticized so that he or she will get down
 to work.
 But once the mind has become engrossed in its work, concentration is a
 necessity in certain areas, at certain times.
 Ordinarily, if we work without resting or sleeping, we ultimately can't
 continue with our work.
 Even though some of our money gets used up when we eat, let it be used
 up — because the result is that our body gains strength from eating and
 can return to its work in line with its duties.
 Even though money gets used up and the food we eat gets used up, still
 it's used up for a purpose: for energy in the body.
 Whatever gets consumed, let it be consumed, because it doesn't hurt our
 purposes.
 If we don't eat, where are we going to get any strength? Whatever gets
 spent, let it be spent for the sake of strength, for the sake of giving
 rise to strength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same holds true with resting in concentration: When we're resting so
 as to give rise to stillness, the stillness is the strength of mind that
 can reinforce discernment and make it agile.
 We have to rest so as to have stillness.
 If there is no stillness, if there's nothing but discernment running, it's
 like a knife that hasn't been sharpened.
 We keep chopping away — chock, chock, chock — but it's hard to tell whether
 we're using the edge of the blade or the back.
 We simply have the desire to know, to see, to understand, to uproot defilement,
 whereas discernment hasn't been sharpened by resting in stillness — the
 reinforcement that gives peace and strength in the heart — and so it's
 like a knife that hasn't been sharpened.
 Whatever gets chopped doesn't cut through easily.
 It's a simple waste of energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So for the sake of what's fitting while resting the mind in its 'home of
 concentration,' we have to let it rest.
 Resting is thus like using a whetstone to sharpen discernment.
 Resting the body strengthens the body, and in the same way resting the
 mind strengthens the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it comes out this time, now that it has strength, it's like a knife
 that has been sharpened.
 The object is the same old object, the discernment is the same old discernment,
 the person investigating is the same old person, but once we focus our
 examination, it cuts right through.
 This time it's like a person who has rested, slept, and eaten at his leisure,
 and whose knife is fully sharpened.
 He chops the same old piece of wood, he's the same old person, and it's
 the same old knife, but it cuts right through with no trouble at all —
 because the knife is sharp, and the person has strength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same way, the object is the same old object, the discernment is the
 same old discernment, the person practicing is the same old person, but
 we've been sharpened.
 The mind has strength as a reinforcement for discernment and so things
 cut right through in no time at all — a big difference from when we hadn't
 rested in concentration!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus concentration and discernment are interrelated.
 They simply do their work at different times.
 When the time comes to center the mind, center it.
 When the time comes to investigate in the area of discernment, give it
 your all — your full alertness, your full strength.
 Get to the full Dhamma: the full causes and the full effects.
 In the same way, when resting, give it a full rest.
 Practice these things at separate times.
 Don't let them interfere with each other — being worried about concentration
 when examining with discernment, or being preoccupied with the affairs
 of discernment when entering concentration — for that would be wrong.
 Whichever work you're going to do, really make it a solid piece of work.
 This is the right way, the appropriate way — the way Right Concentration
 really is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once discernment has begun uprooting defilements step by step, the heart
 develops brightness.
 The lightness of the mind is one of the benefits that come from removing
 the things that are hazardous, the things that are filthy.
 We see the value of this benefit and keep on investigating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What defilement is, is a weight on the heart.
 Our mind is like a prisoner constantly overpowered — coerced and tormented
 — by defilements and mental effluents ever since we were born.
 When we come right down to it, where is defilement? Where is being and
 birth? Right here in this same heart.
 When you investigate, these things gather in, gather in, and enter this
 single heart.
 The cycle of rebirth doesn't refer to anything else: It refers to this
 single heart that spins in circles.
 It's the only thing that leads us to birth and death.
 Why? Because the seeds of these things are in the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we use mindfulness and discernment to investigate, we explore so as
 to see clearly, and we keep cutting in, step by step, until we reach the
 mind that is the culprit, harboring unawareness (avijja), which is the
 important seed of the cycle in the heart.
 We keep dissecting, keep investigating in, investigating in, so that there
 is nothing left of 'this is this' or 'that is that.' We focus our investigation
 on the mind in the same way as we have done with phenomena (sabhava-dhamma)
 in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No matter how much brightness there may be in the heart, we should know
 that it's simply a place for the heart to rest temporarily as long as we
 are still unable to investigate it to the point where we can disperse and
 destroy it.
 But don't forget that this shining star of a heart is actually unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So investigate, taking that as the focal point of your investigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then.
 If this is going to be obliterated until there's no more awareness, leaving
 nothing at all — to the point where the 'knower' is destroyed along with
 it — then let's find out once and for all.
 We're investigating to find the truth, to know the truth, so we have to
 get all the way down to causes and effects, to the truth of everything
 of every sort.
 Whatever is going to be destroyed, let it be destroyed.
 Even if ultimately the 'knower' who is investigating will be destroyed
 as well, then let's find out with our mindfulness and discernment.
 We don't have to leave anything remaining as an island or a vantage point
 to deceive ourselves.
 Whatever is 'us,' whatever is 'ours,' don't leave it standing.
 Investigate down to the truth of all things together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's left, after the defilement of unawareness is absolutely destroyed,
 is something beyond the range to which convention can reach or destroy.
 This is called the pure mind, or purity.
 The nature of this purity cannot be destroyed by anything at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defilements are conventional realities that can arise and vanish.
 Thus they can be cleansed, made to increase, made to decrease, made to
 disappear, because they are an affair of conventions.
 But the mind pure and simple — the phenomenon called a released mind —
 lies beyond the range to which any defilements, which are all conventions,
 can reach and destroy.
 If the mind isn't yet pure, it's a conventional reality just like other
 things, because conventional things have infiltrated it.
 Once they are entirely removed, the phenomenon of release is one that no
 defilement can any longer affect — because it lies beyond range.
 So what is destroyed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stress stops, because the cause of stress stops.
 Nirodha — the cessation of stress — also stops.
 The path, the tool that wipes out the cause of stress, also stops.
 The four Noble Truths all stop together.
 Stress stops, the cause of stress stops, the path stops, the cessation
 of stress stops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But listen! What knows that 'that stops' is not a Noble Truth.
 It lies above the Noble Truths.
 The investigation of the Noble Truths is an investigation for the sake
 of this.
 Once we reach the real thing, the four Noble Truths have no more role to
 play, no need to be cleansed, remedied, or removed.
 For example, discernment: Now that we've worked to the full extent, we
 can let go of discernment, with no need to set rules for it.
 Both mindfulness and discernment are tools in the battle.
 Once the war is over, the enemy is wiped out, so these qualities are no
 longer at issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's left? Purity.
 The Buddha, in proclaiming the Dhamma to the world, took it from this pure
 nature.
 The doctrines of the religion came from this nature, and in the approach
 he used in teaching, he had to teach about stress because these conditions
 are directly related to this mind.
 He taught us to know how to remedy, how to stop, how to strive — everything
 of every sort — all the way to the goal at the end of the path, after which
 nothing more need be said.
 This is purity.
 The mind has come out to the outside world.
 It has left the prison and come to the outside world — freedom — never
 to be imprisoned again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But no one wants to go to this world, because they have never seen it.
 This is an important world — lokuttara, the transcendent, a realm higher
 than other worlds — but we simply call it the outside world, outside of
 all conventions.
 We call it a 'world' just as a figure of speech, because our world has
 its conventions, and so we simply talk about it that way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Think about escaping from this prison.
 You've been born in prison, live in prison and die in prison.
 You've never once died outside of prison.
 So, for once, get your heart out of prison.
 You'll be really comfortable — really comfortable! — like the Buddha and
 his Noble Disciples: They were born in prison like you, but they died outside
 of the prison.
 They died outside of the world.
 They didn't die in this world that's so narrow and confining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll ask to stop here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Birth & Death
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People come with questions — some of which I can remember — and everyone
 has the question that's waiting right at the barn door: Is there a next
 world after death? The next world, who goes on to the next world: These
 sorts of things aren't any one person's issue.
 They're an issue for all of us who are carrying a burden.
 When people ask this sort of question, I ask them in return, 'Was there
 a yesterday? Was there a this morning? Is there a present at this moment?'
 They admit that there was and is.
 'Then will there be a tomorrow? A day after tomorrow? A this month? A next
 month? A this year? A next year and years after that?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Things in the past that we can remember, we can use to make guesses about
 the future.
 Even for things that haven't yet happened, we can make comparisons with
 things that have already occurred.
 The future has to follow the way things have been in the past.
 For example, yesterday has already occurred, today is occurring.
 These things have followed one after the other.
 We know this, we remember, we haven't forgotten.
 This afternoon, this evening, tonight, tomorrow morning: We've already
 seen that things have been like this.
 This is the way things have happened, without being otherwise, and so we
 accept that this is the way they will continue to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Doubts about this world and the next, or about things concerning ourselves:
 This is delusion about ourselves.
 This is why these things become big issues, causing endless fuss all over
 the world of rebirth.
 'Is there a next world? When people die, are they reborn?' These questions
 go together, for who is it that takes birth and dies? We ourselves — always
 dying and taking birth.
 What comes to this world and goes to the next world is us.
 Who else would it be? If not for this being of the world, this wanderer,
 there wouldn't be anyone weighed down with these questions and burdens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the harm of delusion, of being unable to remember.
 It shows within us, but we can't catch hold of its causes, of why it has
 come about.
 Things that have happened, we can't remember.
 Our own affairs spin us around in circles and get us so tangled up that
 we don't know which way to go.
 This is why self-delusion is an endless complication.
 Being deluded about other things is not so bad, but being deluded about
 ourselves blocks all the exits.
 We can't find any way out.
 The results come right back at us — they don't go anywhere else — bringing
 us suffering, because these sorts of doubts are questions with which we
 bind ourselves, not questions by which we set ourselves free.
 We can have no hope of resolving and understanding these doubts if we don't
 find confirmation of the Dhamma in the area of meditation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why the Lord Buddha taught us to unravel and look at our own affairs.
 But unraveling our own affairs is something very critical.
 If we do it by guessing or speculating or whatever, we won't succeed.
 The only way to succeed is to develop goodness step by step as a means
 of support and of drawing us in to mental development (bhavana), or meditation,
 so as to unravel and look at our own affairs, which lie gathered in the
 range of meditation.
 This is what will lead us to know clearly and to cut through our doubts,
 at the same time leading us to satisfactory results.
 We will be able to stop wondering about death and rebirth or death and
 annihilation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are our own affairs? The affairs of the heart.
 The heart is what acts, creating causes and results for itself all the
 time: pleasure, pain, complications, and turmoil.
 For the most part, it ties itself down more than helping itself.
 If we don't force it into good ways, the hearts reaps trouble as a result,
 the suffering that comes from being agitated and anxious, thinking restlessly
 from various angles for no worthwhile reason.
 The results we receive are an important factor in making us pained and
 unsettled.
 This is thus a difficult matter, a heavy matter for all those who are deluded
 about the world, deluded about themselves, agitated by the world, and agitated
 about themselves without being interested in confirming the truth about
 themselves using the principles of the Dhamma, principles that guarantee
 the truth.
 For example, once we die, we must be reborn; as long as the seeds of rebirth
 are in the heart, we have to continue being reborn repeatedly.
 It can't be otherwise — for instance, being annihilated at death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha teaches us to keep watch of the instigator.
 In other words, we should observe our own heart, which is what causes birth
 and death.
 If we don't understand it, he tells us various angles from which to approach
 until we understand and can deal with it properly.
 In particular, he teaches us to meditate, using any of the meditation themes,
 repeating it so that the mind — which has no footing to hold to, which
 is in such a turmoil of finding no refuge that it dwells in unlimited dreams
 and infatuations — will gain enough of a footing to get on its feet, will
 gain quiet and calm, free from the distraction and unsteadiness that would
 destroy the peace of mind we want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, he teaches us to repeat 'buddho, dhammo, sangho' or 'atthi'
 (bones), 'kesa' (hair of the head), 'loma' (hair of the body), or whatever
 phrase suits our temperament, being mindful to keep watch over our meditation
 theme so as not to become forgetful and send the mind elsewhere, away from
 it.
 This is so that the mind, which we used to send in various places, can
 latch onto or dwell with its Dhamma-theme: its meditation word.
 Our awareness, which used to be scattered among various preoccupations,
 will now gather into that point — the mind — which is the gathering place
 of awareness.
 All the currents of our awareness will converge at the Dhamma-theme we
 are repeating or pursuing with interest.
 This is because the meditation word — which is something for the mind to
 hold to, so that it can gain a footing — becomes more and more an object
 of clear and conspicuous awareness.
 Thus at the beginning stages of meditation, the meditation word is very
 important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have seen the intrinsic value of the peace that appears this way,
 we at the same time see clearly the harm that comes from the agitation
 and turmoil of the mind that has no footing to hold to, and that creates
 havoc for itself.
 We needn't ask anyone: The benefits of a peaceful mind and the harm of
 an agitated mind, we see within our own mind from having practiced meditation.
 This is a step, the first step, by which the Buddha teaches us to know
 the affairs of the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then try to make the mind progressively more firmly settled and calm
 by repeating the meditation word, as already mentioned.
 We keep at it, again and again, until we become adept, until the mind can
 become still the way we want it to.
 The sense of well-being that arises from a calm heart becomes even more
 prominent and clear all the time.
 As soon as the mind becomes still, giving rise to clear and prominent awareness
, it is at the same time a gathering in of the defilements into a single
 spot so that we can see them more clearly and more easily observe their
 behavior — so that we can more easily cure them and remove them with the
 levels of discernment suited to dealing with crude, intermediate, and subtle
 defilements step by step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, concerning defilements, the things that force the mind to be agitated
 in countless, inconceivable ways: We can't catch sight of what defilement
 is, what the mind is, what the Dhamma is, until we first have a firm basis
 of mental stillness.
 When the mind gathers in and is still, the defilements gather in and are
 still as well.
 When the mind draws into itself, to be itself or to become a point on which
 we can focus and understand, the affairs of defilement also enter a restricted
 range in that same point.
 They gather in at the heart and rarely ever run loose to stir up trouble
 for the heart as they used to before the mind was still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the mind is still so that it can stand on its feet, we are then taught
 to use our discernment to investigate, unravel, and contemplate the various
 parts of the body in which the defilements hide out.
 What is the mind interested in? When it isn't quiet, with what does it
 like to involve itself? While the mind is quiet, it doesn't stir up trouble
 for itself, but a common habit with us human beings is that once we have
 gained peace and relaxation, we get lazy.
 We simply want to lie down and rest.
 We don't want to unravel the body, the elements, or the khandhas with our
 mindfulness and discernment for the sake of seeing the truth and removing
 the various defilements from the heart.
 We don't like to reflect on the fact that those who have abandoned and
 removed the various kinds of defilement that hide out in the body and the
 khandhas have done so by using mindfulness and discernment.
 As for mental stillness or concentration, that's simply a gathering together
 of the defilements into a restricted range.
 It's not an abandoning or a removal of defilement.
 Please remember this and take it to heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart, when it isn't still, tends to get entangled with sights, sounds,
 smells, tastes, and tactile sensations, and to take them as issues for
 stirring itself up.
 We can know with our mindfulness and discernment which of the various sights,
 sounds, etc., the mind tends to favor most strongly.
 While we are investigating, we can know with our mindfulness and discernment
 the objects with which the mind is involving itself.
 We can observe the affairs of the mind because the mind has been still.
 As soon as it begins to head out toward its various preoccupations, we
 know.
 This is why we are taught to investigate and unravel things with our discernmen
t so as to know what the mind goes to involve itself with.
 Try to observe so as to know, so as to see clearly with mindfulness and
 discernment while you are investigating.
 Only when you are stilling the mind in concentration is there no need for
 you to investigate, because concentration and discernment take turns working
 at different times, as I have already explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are investigating visual objects, with which visual object is the
 mind most involved? What is the reason? Look at the object.
 Dissect it.
 Analyze it into its parts so as to see it clearly for what it truly is.
 Once you have dissected the object — whatever it is — so as to see it with
 discernment in line with its truth, at the same time you will see the absurdity
, the deceptiveness of the mind that grows attached and misconstrues things
 in all kinds of ways without any real reason, without any basis in fact.
 Once you have investigated carefully, you'll see that the object has none
 of the worth construed and assigned to it by the mind.
 There are simply the assumptions of the mind that has fallen for the object,
 that's all.
 Once you have investigated, separating the various parts of 'their' body
 or 'your' body so as to see them in detail, you won't see anything of any
 worth or substance at all.
 The heart of its own accord will see the harmfulness of its assumptions,
 its labels and attachments.
 The more it investigates, the more clearly it sees — not only the various
 sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations, but also the acts
 of the mind involved with those objects — until it fully knows and clearly
 sees with discernment, because it has been constantly unraveling things
 both within and without.
 You fully know and clearly see the acts inside the heart that become involved,
 knowing that they come about for this reason and that, all of which are
 thoroughly absurd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before, you didn't know why the mind was involved.
 But now you know clearly that it is involved for this reason and that:
 namely, delusion and mistaken assumptions.
 When you investigate in line with the truth and see the true nature of
 external things, you know clearly within yourself that the mind has construed
 phenomena to be like this and like that, which is why it has continually
 developed more and more attachment and clinging, more and more of the defilemen
ts of love and hatred.
 The heart then realizes its own absurdity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the heart realizes that it has been deluded and absurd, it withdraws
 inward, because if it were to continue to think of becoming attached to
 those things, it would get cut right through by discernment — so what would
 it gain from becoming attached? To investigate so as to know clearly that
 this is this, and that is that, in line with the truth of every individual
 thing of every sort: This is the way to unravel the great mass of problems
 that, taken together, are results — the mass of suffering inside the heart.
 This is how we are taught to unravel it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discernment constantly keeps unraveling things without letup until it
 understands clearly and distinctly, we don't have to tell it to let go.
 Once the mind knows, it lets go of its own accord.
 It is bound to let go of its own accord.
 The mind attached is the mind that doesn't yet know, doesn't yet understand
 with discernment.
 Once the full heart knows, it fully lets go, with no concern or regrets.
 All the concerns that used to bother and disturb the mind vanish of their
 own accord because discernment sees right through them.
 Once it sees everything clearly and distinctly, what is there left to grope
 for? The problems of the heart that used to be broad and wide-ranging now
 become more and more restricted.
 Problems concerning outside affairs become less and less, as I have said
 in previous talks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to unravel the mind, the gathering point of subtle defilements,
 so as to see what it is looking for when it 'blips' out.
 Where does it 'blip' from? What is there that pressures the mind into forming
 thoughts of various issues? When mindfulness and discernment can keep up
 with the thoughts that come 'blipping' out, these thoughts vanish immediately
 without amounting to anything, without forming issues to entangle us as
 they did before.
 This is because mindfulness and discernment are wise to them, and always
 ready to herd them in and wipe them out as they keep following in on the
 tracks of the origin of defilement to see exactly where it is.
 Where do its children and grandchildren — the defilements — come from?
 Animals have their parents, what are the parents of these defilements?
 Where are they? Why do they keep forming again and again, thinking again
 and again? Why do they give rise to assumptions and interpretations, increasing
 suffering and stress without stop?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, thought-formations are formed at the mind.
 They don't come from anywhere else.
 So investigate, following them in, step by step, without losing the trail
 that will lead you to the truth, to the culprit.
 This is genuine exploring, observing the affairs of all the defilements,
 using the power of genuine mindfulness and discernment.
 Ultimately we will know what the mind is lacking, what it is still connected
 with, what it is interested in, what it wants to know and to see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we follow the connections, follow the seeds on in.
 Day by day, the defilements become more and more restricted, more and more
 restricted.
 This is because the bridges that connect them to sights, sound, smells,
 tastes, tactile sensations, and the various things of the world in general
 have been cut away from the mind by using continual mindfulness and discernment
 to the point where we have no more doubts.
 It's as if the outside world didn't exist.
 There remain only the preoccupations that form — blip, blip, blip — in
 the mind.
 This is where the rebellious monarch lies.
 The one who concocts and creates, the one who struggles and writhes restlessly
 in big and little ways, lies right here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before, we didn't know in what ways the mind was writhing.
 All we knew were the results that appeared, unsatisfactory every time,
 giving us nothing but suffering and stress, which no one in the world wants.
 Our own heart was so burdened with stress that it couldn't find a way out,
 because it had no inkling of how to remedy things.
 But now that we know, these things gradually disappear so that we know
 and see more and more clearly at the mind, which is where unawareness is
 performing as an actor, as an issue-maker, here inside us.
 It can't find anything to latch onto outside, so it simply acts inside.
 Why doesn't it latch on? Because mindfulness and discernment understand,
 and have it surrounded.
 So how could it latch onto anything? All it does is go 'blip, blip, blip'
 in the mind.
 We now see it more clearly and focus our investigation on it, scratch away
 at it, dig away at it with mindfulness and discernment until we have it
 surrounded every time the mind makes a move.
 There are no longer any lapses in alertness as there were in the first
 stages when mindfulness and discernment were still stumbling and crawling
 along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our persistence at this level is no longer a matter of every activity.
 It becomes a matter of every mental moment in which the mind ripples.
 Mindfulness and discernment have to know both when the rippling comes out
 and when it vanishes — and so there are no issues that can arise in the
 moment the mind is fashioning a thought, an assumption, or an interpretation.
 This is because our rocket-fast mindfulness and discernment can keep up
 with things.
 As soon as a rippling occurs, we know.
 When we know, it vanishes.
 No issues can arise or connect.
 They vanish the moment they appear.
 They can't branch out anywhere because the bridges to outside matters have
 been cut by mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When mindfulness and discernment are exploring earnestly, relentlessly,
 unflaggingly, they want to know, to see, and to destroy whatever is hazardous.
 'What causes us to take birth as individuals and beings? What leads us
 to wander in the round of rebirth? What are the causes, what are the conditions
 that connect things? Where are they right now?' This is called scratching
 away with mindfulness and discernment, digging away at the mind of unawareness.
 There is no way we can escape knowing, seeing, and severing the important
 cause and condition that creates suffering and stress for the beings of
 the world: namely, the defilement of unawareness that has infiltrated the
 mind in an insidious way.
 See? This is the power of mindfulness, discernment, conviction, and persistence
 on this level, something that meditators never imagine will be possible
 to this extent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where defilements begin to reveal themselves, because they have
 no place to hide.
 They no longer have the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations
 in which they used to hole up, because the bridges have been cut.
 Their only hideout is in the mind: The mind is the hideout of unawareness.
 When we go ransacking through the mind until everything is smashed completely
 to smithereens with nothing left — in the same way that we used discernment
 to investigate phenomena in general — then when the mind of unawareness
 is ransacked in this way, ultimately the supreme defilement — unawareness,
 the emperor of the round of rebirth — is completely obliterated from the
 mind.
 At this point, how can we help but know what it is that causes birth on
 this or that level? As for where we will or won't be reborn, that's not
 important.
 What's important is seeing clearly that this is what has caused birth and
 death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how we prove whether death is followed by rebirth or annihilation.
 We have to prove it at the mind by practicing in line with the principles
 of mental development, in the same way the Buddha and his Noble Disciples
 practiced and knew so that it was clear to their hearts.
 There is no other way to know.
 Don't go groping, guessing, scratching at fleas.
 You'll end up all mangy and dirty, without gaining anything at all.
 When we reach this point, it's called eliminating birth — whose primary
 seeds lie within — completely from the mind.
 From this moment onward, there is nothing that can ever again connect and
 branch out.
 Mindfulness and discernment on the level of Dhamma-realization know this
 completely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the culprit who asks, 'Is there a next world?' This is the one who
 reserves a place in the next world, the one who reserved our place in past
 worlds, the one who has been born and has died over and over and over again,
 unceasingly, relentlessly, to the point where it can't remember the births,
 the deaths, the pleasures, the pains, the sufferings large and small in
 its various lives.
 This is the one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So please remember its face and take it to heart.
 Probe it and slash it away to smithereens.
 Don't show it any mercy: You'll simply be feeding and fattening it for
 it to come back and destroy you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we gather the defilements, they come into the one mind.
 They gather here and we destroy them right here.
 Once we have finished destroying them so that nothing is left, the questions
 about birth, death, and the suffering and stress that result from birth
 and death no longer exist.
 We can know this clearly and fully for ourselves in a way that is immediately
 apparent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no more problem about whether or not there is a next world.
 Our past worlds, we have already abandoned.
 As for the next world, the bridges have all been sent flying.
 And as for the present, we're wise to it.
 There are no conventions, no matter now refined, left in the mind.
 This is truly a mind with no more problems.
 This is where we solve the mind's problems.
 Once they are all solved here, there will never be any problems again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No matter how wide the world, no matter how many universes there are, they
 are all a matter of conventional reality, which has no limit.
 The heart that knows all around itself is no longer involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The affairs that have been constantly assaulting us up to the present, and
 that will do so on into the future, are the affairs of this mind that has
 hazards buried within itself.
 That's all there is.
 When these hazards have been entirely removed, there is nothing left to
 be dangerous or poisonous ever again.
 The question of whether or not there is a next world no longer holds any
 interest, because the realization has gone straight to the heart that it
 is done with the question of connecting up with any other world again.
 So in studying and solving our own problem, we tackle it right here.
 This way there's hope that we can put an end to it — at the same time not
 causing any harm to ourselves or to others at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lord Buddha solved the problem right here.
 His arahant disciples solved it right here — knew it right here, severed
 it completely right here.
 The proclamation that the Teacher was completely free of suffering and
 stress, that he was the foremost teacher of the world, came from this knowledge
 and this freedom from issues.
 Our study of the world is completed right here at the mind.
 Our study of the Dhamma reaches full completion right here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 'world' means the world of living beings.
 'Living beings' (satta) means those who are caught up, caught up right
 at the mind.
 This is where we cut through the problem.
 This is where we study and know.
 The arahant disciples studied and knew right here with their full hearts
 — and that was the end of the problem.
 They solved the problem and it fell away, with nothing remaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as for us, we take on the whole thing: the entire heap of suffering
 and stress.
 We take on all problems, but we aren't willing to solve them.
 We simply hoard them to weigh ourselves down all the time.
 Our heart is thus filled with a heap of stress that nothing else can equal,
 because nothing else is as heavy as a heart heaped with stress.
 Carrying this heap of stress and problems is heavy on the heart because
 we haven't completed our studies.
 We carry nothing but this heap because of our delusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When vijja — true knowledge — has appeared and eradicated all the hazards
 from the heart, this is what it means to 'graduate' in line with natural
 principles, with none of the conferring of degrees or titles that would
 cause us to become even more deluded.
 To complete our study of the Dhamma in the heart means that we have erased
 it completely of all delusion, with no traces remaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that moment, the three levels of existence — the levels of sensuality,
 form, and formlessness — become no more problem, because they all lie in
 the heart.
 The level of sensuality is a mind composed of sensuality.
 The levels of form and formlessness are the conventions of the various
 things in those levels buried in the heart.
 When the heart removes them, that's the end of the problem.
 When we solve the problem, this is where we solve it.
 This world and the next world lie right here, because that which steps
 into any world lies right here.
 This mind is what steps out to receive stress in greater or lesser measure.
 The motor, the propeller, lies here in the heart and nowhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lord Buddha thus taught at the right point, the most appropriate point:
 the heart, which is the primary culprit.
 The things I have mentioned here, with whom do they lie if not with each
 of us? And if we don't solve them right here, where will we solve them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Living beings have to go to their various worlds through the power of the
 good and bad kamma within the heart.
 That which goes to the worlds — to the bonfires — is this very heart.
 If we don't solve the problem right here, there is no way of escaping the
 bonfires of stress and anxiety.
 If we solve the problem right here, there is no problem as to where the
 fires are, because we can keep ourselves protected.
 That's all there is to it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these things are very heavy worlds for living beings in general.
 Whatever problems arise, they arise right here.
 'Is death followed by rebirth? By annihilation? Is there a next world?
 Does hell exist? Does heaven? Does evil exist? Does merit?' Everywhere
 I go, there's the same question: 'Do heaven and hell exist?' I never feel
 like answering.
 I don't see any reason to answer it, because that which is burdened with
 heaven and hell is the heart, which everyone already has.
 So why waste time answering? After all, I'm not a record-keeper for heaven
 and hell!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Straighten things out right here at the cause that will go to heaven and
 hell.
 Straighten out the bad causes and foster the good.
 There will then be no stress, if we straighten things out right on target.
 And how can we miss? The well-taught Dhamma (svakkhata-dhamma) teaches
 us to solve things right on target, not off-target.
 The Dhamma that leads (niyyanika-dhamma) by means of the well-taught Dhamma,
 leads out those who are caught up in stress and anxiety through the power
 of delusion.
 Where will we solve things if we don't solve them at the heart? The big
 problems lie solely at the heart, at this awareness.
 Crudeness is a matter of this awareness.
 Refinement is a matter of this awareness.
 That which makes people crude or refined is this awareness, with defilement
 as the reinforcement.
 If the mind becomes refined, it's because goodness is the reinforcement,
 making it refined until it goes beyond the final point of refinement, beyond
 the final point of conventions, and ends up gaining release from all stress,
 with no seeds for any further connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another question that people are always asking is how to overcome laziness.
 If we were to tell them to use laziness to overcome laziness, it would
 be tantamount to telling them to become an enemy of beds, blankets, and
 pillows by sleeping without ever waking up.
 It would be as if they were already dead, because laziness makes you weak
 and listless like a person ready to die.
 How can you use laziness to cure laziness? Once you get a nice resting
 place as a means of lulling you to drown in sleep, it's as if you were
 already dead — dead right there on the pillow! Even when you wake up, you
 don't want to get up, because laziness stomps all over you and destroys
 you, forcing you not to get up.
 This is how it goes when you use laziness to cure laziness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use energy and persistence to cure laziness, then you get right up,
 ready to fight.
 If there's a fight, you have hope of winning.
 But if you simply lie prostrate, all you can do is lose — although whether
 we should call it losing or something else is hard to say, because you
 don't even put up a fight at all, so how can you say that you lose? If
 there's a fight and you can't win, then you can say that this person wins
 and that person loses.
 But here there's no fight at all! You simply lie there groveling.
 If you don't call this being a servant in the house of defilements, what
 would you call it? Because that's what it is: being a servant in their
 house.
 If you use laziness — to the point of being its servant — to cure defilement,
 you end up piling on even more defilements.
 Or what would you say? As things stand, defilements already fill the heart,
 so if you foster them even more, where are you going to put them? You've
 got only one heart! The only way is to remove defilements so that you can
 begin to breathe, and not let them sit on top of your nose so that you
 can never gasp a breath at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remove them so that you can begin to see yourself: 'At last, after all the
 time I've been meditating, I've finally seen a piece of defilement's grandchild
 — laziness — fall off, just like a chip of bark off a tree.
 Today at last I can begin to see myself.
 Up to now there's only been defilement making use of my nose and mouth.
 It's really infuriating!'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Persistence.
 Diligence.
 Exertion in the way of reason that can accomplish our purposes: This is
 the path that sages have followed.
 Even though it may be difficult, we're up to the fight.
 It's like removing a thorn from your foot: Even though it hurts to remove
 it, you have to bear it.
 If you let it stay there, your whole foot will become infected and putrid.
 You won't be able to walk at all, and may even lose the foot.
 So there's only one reasonable course: Pull it out.
 No matter how much it hurts, you have to bear it, because you have to get
 the thing out! This is a line of reasoning you have to accept.
 Once the thorn is out, it holds no more poison.
 Put medicine on the wound, and the foot will heal without flaring up as
 it would if the thorn were still embedded there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defilement is just like a thorn.
 We let it lie buried forever in the heart.
 As long as it remains, the heart is infected and putrid, there in the midst
 of the round of rebirth — an endless monotony.
 Is this what you want? To be a putrid person? Ask yourself.
 Don't ask the defilements.
 They'll simply do you more harm.
 If you don't want this, you have to fight them.
 Once you fight them, you are sure somehow of finding a way to win.
 No matter how many times you lose, there will have to come a time when
 you win.
 Once you've won, then you can keep on winning, winning and winning until
 there is nothing left for you to fight because the defilements are completely
 mauled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you win, whom do you defeat? You defeat laziness with diligence.
 You defeat defilement with energy and persistence.
 This way you gain release from all stress.
 This is how you solve the problem of birth and death, right at the heart.
 There is only this spot that most needs solving.
 It's the most appropriate spot, the most correct spot to solve.
 To solve things, you solve them here.
 There is no way you can solve them anywhere else.
 Keep on making assumptions and interpretations for aeons and aeons, and
 you'll simply continue to be burdened with the problem as it leads you
 to birth, death, suffering, and stress.
 So you shouldn't be bold in speculating and guessing, or you'll waste your
 time and die in vain, because there is no way the problem will be solved
 with guesses and speculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Does suffering exist, or not? Do merit (puñña) and evil exist, or not?'
 Actually, we are experiencing these things, all of us, with no possible
 exceptions.
 'Evil' is mental darkness and stress.
 'Merit' is well-being and ease.
 These things exist in the body and mind of every person, so how can you
 deny them? 'Merit' is a name for well-being.
 The Buddha calls it merit.
 Stress he calls evil.
 We are touched by good and evil all the time.
 Whether we live in this world or the next, we can't help but meet with
 good and evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hell or not-hell, if there's pain filling the body and mind, who wants it?
 Who wants to meet with it? This is something we all know, so why ask about
 hell when it's already with us like this? Wherever pain is burning us,
 it's as hot as being branded with fire.
 No matter where you're branded, it all has to be hot in the same way.
 You can call it hell or not-hell as you like, but nobody wants it, because
 pain is something we have all known for ourselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And where — to trouble your heart — are you going to go looking for heaven?
 When you meet with the well-being that comes from practicing the Dhamma
 — and especially with well-being in the heart, beginning with stillness
 and calm in ascending stages to the point where the mind develops a firm
 and solid footing within, so that it is sure of itself; and then further,
 to the point where you gain release — then where are you going to ask about
 heaven and nibbana?There's no need to ask.
 You know them directly with your heart.
 You are the owner, in charge of the heart that is clearly the instigator,
 so where else are you going to look — for the names 'heaven' and 'hell'?
 What is there to grope for?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You've got the real thing within you.
 That's all there is to the matter.
 The Dhamma of the Lord Buddha doesn't delude people into groping for this
 or that.
 So take hold of the real thing right here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well then.
 That should be enough for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Taste for the Dhamma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the basic principles of the doctrine, we are taught that, 'A delight
 in the Dhamma surpasses all other delights.
 The flavor of the Dhamma surpasses all other flavors.' This statement was
 made by a person who had felt delight in the true Dhamma, who had tasted
 the flavor of the true Dhamma: namely, our Lord Buddha.
 For this reason, those who take an interest in listening to his teachings
 find that no matter what the statement, each word, each sentence goes straight
 to the heart — except, of course, for people who are simply going through
 the motions of listening without focusing the mind, letting it drift engrossed
 in various things in line with its original inclinations without gaining
 anything of any worth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The teachings of the religion have no meaning in a mind of this sort until
 it turns to the Dhamma, develops an interest of its own accord, and puts
 the Dhamma into practice.
 Only then will the flavor of the Dhamma seep deep into the heart, nurturing
 it and giving rise to conviction step by step.
 This is because the heart now has a continuing basis for the Dhamma that
 supports it in ascending stages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, when listening to Dhamma dealing with the practice, if our
 mind doesn't have any experience with meditation, has never taken an interest
 in the Dhamma, has never taken an interest in practicing the Dhamma, then
 not even a single statement will arrest the attention.
 When listening to a talk on the practice dealing with the stages of the
 mind, the progress of the mind, setting the mind aright in relationship
 to the defilements or to the path — mindfulness and discernment, or persistent
 effort — we won't understand.
 When we don't understand, we become frustrated and turn our attention elsewhere.
 Perhaps we may become drowsy and want to go to sleep or something of the
 sort.
 The talk seems long because it acts as a drag on our defilements, preventing
 them from roaming around as they please.
 This is because we have to keep control over the mind while we listen to
 the talk; and the mind, when kept under control in this way, feels hemmed
 in, imprisoned within limits it finds oppressive.
 Annoyed and bored, it doesn't want to listen, except for the purpose of
 creating useless issues for entangling itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when we keep listening with interest, meditating even while we listen,
 the mind becomes focused and follows along with the stream of Dhamma being
 explained.
 The mind grows still because the awareness making contact with the Dhamma
 maintains that contact continuously, step by step, without break.
 The heart has no chance to slip away to any other preoccupations that are
 its enemies while listening, and so it's able to settle down and be still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be able to settle down in this way is to begin building a base, or to
 scrub our vessel — the heart — making it clean and fit to receive the Dhamma.
 The heart will start growing more peaceful and calm, seeing the value of
 listening to the Dhamma as explained by the Buddha: 'Listening to the Dhamma
 has five rewards.' The fifth reward is the important one: 'The mind of the
 listener becomes radiant and calm.' This one is very important, but it must
 build on the earlier ones.
 'The listener hears things he or she has never heard' — this is the basis
 for the rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that we have never listened to anything in the way of the practice
 or whatever.
 When we come to listen, we gain an understanding of things we have never
 heard before.
 Things that we have heard before, but never understood clearly, we gradually
 come to understand more and more clearly.
 We can bring our views more correctly into line.
 And finally we reach the stage where 'the mind of the listener becomes
 radiant and calm.' When results of this sort appear, a delight in the Dhamma
 will develop of its own accord.
 The flavor of the Dhamma will begin to appear while we listen and while
 the mind is stilling itself to listen.
 Even though this flavor may not yet surpass all others, it is nevertheless
 absorbing and arresting, and will remain long in the memory, not easily
 erased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why meditators place great importance on listening to the Dhamma.
 If you were to call it being attached to one's teacher, I wouldn't disagree.
 Meditating monks always like to listen to their teachers.
 If they have a teacher they venerate and revere in the area of meditation,
 in the area of the mind, then wherever he lives they will keep coming to
 be with him until there is hardly enough room for them to stay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Venerable Acariya Mun is an example.
 Wherever he stayed, students would come continually from near and far to
 search him out.
 Even though they couldn't all stay in the same place with him, inasmuch
 as there wasn't enough room, they would still be willing to stay in nearby
 areas, two, three, four, or seven to eight kilometers away, so that they
 might conveniently come to hear his teachings on the uposatha days and
 'Dhamma meeting' days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the uposatha days, after listening to the Patimokkha and to his instructions,
 anyone who had any doubts or questions about the Dhamma could ask him to
 resolve them.
 For this reason, the township where he stayed was filled with nothing but
 meditating monks and novices.
 When uposatha day came, they would begin gathering together after the morning
 meal.
 At 1:00 p.m.
 they would hear the Patimokkha; and after the Patimokkha, Venerable Acariya
 Mun would give his talk — that's when he'd usually give his talk, after
 the Patimokkha.
 This would be an important part of the practice for those who lived with
 him.
 During the Rains Retreat (vassa) we would meet like this every seven days.
 Outside of the Rains Retreat, the schedule wasn't too fixed, but this is
 how he would usually schedule things for those of us who stayed directly
 with him.
 Each time we would listen to his talks we would gain in insight and understandi
ng — without fail.
 This is why meditation monks are attached to their teachers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each time we would listen to him, he himself would be like a magnet drawing
 the interest of the monks and novices.
 In all things related to the Dhamma, he would be the major attracting force,
 inspiring fascination and delight in the Dhamma.
 There was a delight in seeing him and meeting him each time, and even more
 so in hearing him speak — talking in general, giving instructions, conversing
 about ordinary things, joking — because he himself was entirely Dhamma.
 Everything he would do or say in any way would keep revealing Dhamma and
 reasonability that could be taken as a lesson, so that those who were intereste
d could gain a lesson each time they heard him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why meditating monks find a great deal of enjoyment in the area
 of the Dhamma by living with a meditation master.
 They go to be with him of their own accord.
 When they are far from him, and their minds aren't yet to the stage where
 they can look after themselves, they are bound to feel lonesome.
 Or if they come across a problem they can't solve, they are sure to miss
 him.
 If they can't work out a solution, they have to run to him for advice so
 as to save a great deal of the time it would take to figure out a solution
 on their own — because he has been through everything of every sort.
 If we would take a problem to him, then as soon as we had finished the
 last sentence, he would immediately have the solution and we would understand
 right then and there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why, when living with a master who has realized the truth, there's
 no delay, no waste of time in dealing with each problem as it arises.
 This is a great benefit for those who come to study with him.
 They're never disappointed.
 The fact that one who has seen the truth is giving the explanation makes
 all the difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment ago I began by mentioning a delight in the Dhamma.
 What I have just been talking about is the same sort of thing: finding
 pleasure in the Dhamma, continual pleasure, through listening to it constantly.
 In the same way, when we practice the Dhamma constantly, the results —
 the flavor and nourishment that come from the practice — increase continually,
 becoming more and more solid and substantial in the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially in the practice of centering the mind: The mind is calm, tranquil,
 contented, and relaxed.
 Its thoughts don't go meddling with anything outside.
 It's as if the world didn't exist, because our attention isn't involved
 with it.
 There's simply the Dhamma to be contemplated and practiced so as to give
 rise to more and more steadiness and strength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on the level of discernment, no matter how broad or narrow our investigation
 of the many phenomena in the world may be, it is exclusively for the sake
 of the Dhamma, for the sake of self-liberation.
 We thus become thoroughly engrossed, day and night.
 The more strongly our heart is set on the Dhamma, the greater its stamina
 and courage.
 It has no concern for life itself, no worries about its living conditions
 or anything external.
 Its only support is the guiding compass of the Dhamma.
 Whether we are sitting, lying down, or whatever, the heart is engrossed
 in its persistent efforts in practicing the Dhamma.
 On the level of concentration, it is engrossed in its stillness of mind.
 On the level of discernment, it is engrossed in its explorations of the
 Dhamma from various angles for the sake of removing defilement, step by
 step, as it investigates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peace of heart is thus possible in each stage of persisting with the practice.
 The more quiet and secluded the place, the more conspicuously this awareness
 stands out.
 Even knowledge in the area of concentration stands out in our inner awareness.
 It stands out for its stillness.
 In the area of discernment, our knowledge stands out for the shrewdness
 and ingenuity of the mind as it explores without ceasing — except when
 resting in the stillness of concentration — just as water from an artesian
 well flows without ceasing during both the wet season and the dry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When phenomena make contact with the mind — or even when they don't — a
 mind already inclined to discernment is bound to investigate, peering into
 every nook and cranny, gaining understanding step by step.
 For example, when we are first taught mindfulness immersed in the body
 (kayagata-sati), it seems superficial — because the mind is superficial.
 It has no footing, no mindfulness, no discernment.
 It hasn't any principles — any Dhamma — to hold to.
 Whatever it hears doesn't really go straight to the heart, because the
 mind is buried way down there, deep under the belly of defilement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But once it develops principles and reasonability within itself, then —
 especially when we're sitting in meditation in a quiet place, investigating
 the body — the whole body seems clear all the way through.
 That's how it really feels to a person meditating on this level.
 It's really enthralling.
 Whether we're contemplating the skin or the body's unattractiveness, it
 appears extremely clear, because that's the way its nature already is —
 simply that our mind hasn't fallen in step with the truth and so is constantly
 taking issue with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 Now that the mind can develop stillness and investigate using its discernment,
 let's take it on a meditation tour, exploring the body: our five khandhas.
 We can travel up to the head, down to the feet, out to the skin, into the
 muscles, tendons, and bones to see how all the parts are related and connected
 by their nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the mind contemplates in this way, step by step, as it gets engrossed
 in its investigation, the final result is that even though we're investigating
 the body, the body doesn't appear in our inner sense of feeling at all.
 The mind feels airy and light.
 The physical body disappears, despite the fact that we continue investigating
 the mental image of the body as before.
 Even though we're using the mental image of the body as the focal point
 of our investigation, the physical aspect of the body no longer appears.
 It completely vanishes.
 We investigate until there's a refinement in the mind's sense of awareness
 to the point where we can make the body in the image die and disintegrate,
 step by step.
 Our awareness is confined solely to the mental image that we are investigating
 by means of discernment.
 We see it distinctly because nothing else is coming in to interfere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind feels no hunger or desire to go skipping outside.
 It's completely engrossed in its work of investigation.
 Its understanding grows clearer and clearer.
 The clearer its understanding, the greater its fascination.
 Ultimately there is simply the mental image, or the idea, and the mind,
 or discernment.
 As for the actual body, it disappears.
 You don't know where it's gone.
 There's no sense of the body at that moment, even though you are investigating
 the body until you see its condition disintegrating clearly within the
 mind — disintegrating until it returns to its original condition as the
 elements of earth, water, wind, and fire.
 Once the body in the image returns to its original elements, the mind then
 withdraws inward, leaving nothing but simple awareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feelings all disappear at this stage.
 Sañña, sankhara, and viññana aren't involved.
 There's simply awareness, sufficient for the mind's state at that moment.
 It enters a really solid stillness, leaving only simple awareness.
 The body sitting here disappears entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is something that can occur in the course of investigating, but please
 don't plan on it.
 Simply listen now for the sake of becoming absorbed and gladdened while
 listening.
 This will give rise to the benefits of listening that you will actually
 see for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will happen when you investigate in line with your own personal traits
 is a completely individual matter that will appear in keeping with your
 temperament.
 As for what occurs with other people, you can't make yourself experience
 what they do, know the way they know, or see the way they see.
 This is something that depends on each person's individual traits.
 Let things follow your own inner nature in line with the way you are able
 to investigate and to know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one point I want to explain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second point: When investigating the body in terms of inconstancy, stress,
 and not-self, then — whether or not you think, 'inconstancy, stress, and
 not-self' — when discernment makes clear contact with the bodily khandha,
 it will be able to know these things on its own, because things that are
 inconstant, stressful, and not-self are things that deserve to be relinquished,
 that inspire dispassion and disenchantment, step by step, until you let
 go.
 When the mind has investigated so that it fully understands, it lets go
 of its own accord without being forced, because each part, each aspect
 of the body or of the khandha being investigated is simply an individual
 truth.
 When the mind investigates clearly in this way, it makes the break automaticall
y, because a truth has encountered a truth: The mind is the mind, and each
 of these individual conditions is a separate condition that hasn't come
 to involve itself with the mind at all.
 The mind will then turn around to see its own fault in being attached.
 'Here I've really been deluded.
 Actually things are like this and this.' This is one stage: When the mind
 hasn't yet made a complete break — when it doesn't yet have adequate strength
 — it will start out by knowing at intervals in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next time you investigate, you know in this way again and it keeps seeping
 in, seeping in, until your knowledge on this level becomes adequate and
 lets go.
 Like duckweed that keeps moving in, moving in to cover the water: After
 you spread it apart, the duckweed comes moving in again, and you spread
 it apart again.
 This is how it is when discernment investigates these things, making forays
 into these things or unraveling them.
 As soon as discernment retreats, subtle defilements come moving in again,
 but after you have investigated many, many times, the duckweed — the various
 types of defilement — begins to thin out.
 Your investigation of these phenomena becomes more and more effortless,
 more and more proficient, more and more subtle, step by step, until it
 reaches a point of sufficiency and the mind extricates itself automatically,
 as I have already explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind — when its mindfulness and discernment are sufficiently strong
 — can extricate itself once and for all.
 This knowledge is clear to it, without any need to ask anyone else ever
 again.
 The heart is sufficient, in and of itself, and sees clearly as 'sanditthiko'
 in the full sense of the term, as proclaimed by the Dhamma, without any
 issues to invite contradiction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third point: Sometimes, when investigating the body, the mind makes contact
 with a feeling of pain, and so turns to investigate it.
 This all depends on the mind's temperament.
 In the same way, when we turn to investigate the feeling, the mind sends
 us back to the body.
 This is because the body and the feeling are interrelated and so must be
 investigated together at the same time, depending on what comes naturally
 to us at that particular time, that particular feeling, and that particular
 part of the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind investigates a feeling of pain, the pain is nothing more than
 'a pain.' The mind looks at it, fixes its attention on it, examines it,
 and then lets it go right there, turning to look at the body.
 The body is the body.
 The feeling is a feeling.
 Then we turn to look at the mind: The mind is the mind.
 We investigate and experiment to find the truth of the body, the feeling,
 and the mind — all three of which are the troublemakers — until we have
 a solid understanding of how each has its own separate reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind pulls back from the body and the feeling, neither the body
 nor the feeling appears.
 All that appears is simple awareness.
 When a mental current flashes out to know, the feeling then appears as
 a feeling.
 These currents are the means by which we know what phenomenon has appeared,
 because this knowledge gives a meaning or a label to the phenomenon as
 being like this or like that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we're going to think in a way that binds us to 'ourself' — in other words,
 in the way of the origin of stress — we have to make use of this act of
 labeling as what leads us to grasp, to become attached, to make various
 assumptions and interpretations.
 If we're going to think in the way of discernment, we have to make use
 of the discernment that is this very same current of the mind to investigate,
 contemplate, until we see clearly by means of discernment and can withdraw
 inwardly in a way that is full of reason — not in a way that is lazy or
 weak, or that is groveling in abject surrender with no gumption left to
 fight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In investigating feeling, when a sañña flashes out, mindfulness is alert
 to it.
 If our investigation of feeling has become refined and precise, then when
 a sañña simply flashes out, we know.
 When sankharas form, they are just like fireflies: blip! If no sañña labels
 them or picks up where they leave off, they simply form — blip! blip! —
 and then vanish, vanish.
 No matter what they form — good thoughts, bad thoughts, crude thoughts,
 subtle thoughts, neutral thoughts, whatever — they are simply a rippling
 of the mind.
 If they occur on their own, when nothing is making contact with the mind,
 they're called sankhara.
 If they occur when something is making contact, they're called viññana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we're talking about the sankharas that form on their own, without anything
 else being involved.
 They form — blip — and then vanish immediately.
 Blip — and then vanish immediately.
 We can see this clearly when the mind converges snugly in the subtle levels
 of concentration and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snugness of the mind's convergence won't have anything else involved
 with it at all.
 All that remains is simple awareness.
 When this simple awareness remains stable this way, we will see clearly
 that it isn't paired with anything else.
 When the mind begins to withdraw from this state to return to its awareness
 of phenomena — returning to its ordinary state of mind that can think and
 form thoughts — there will be a rippling — blip — that vanishes immediately.
 It will then be empty as before.
 In a moment it will 'blip' again.
 The mind will form just a flash of a thought that doesn't yet amount to
 anything, just a rippling that vanishes immediately the instant it's known.
 As soon as there's a rippling, we are alert to it because of the power
 of mindfulness keeping watch at the moment — or because of the strength
 of concentration that hasn't yet dissipated.
 But after these ripples have formed two or three times, they come more
 and more frequently, and soon we return to ordinary consciousness, just
 as when a baby awakens from sleep: At first it fidgets a bit, and then
 after this happens a number of times, it finally opens its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same is true of the mind.
 It has calm...
 Here I'm talking about concentration when discernment is there with it.
 The various ways of investigating I have mentioned are all classed as discernme
nt.
 When we have investigated enough, the mind enters stillness, free from
 mental formations and fashionings and from any sort of disturbance.
 All that appears is awareness.
 Even just this has the full flavor of a centered mind, which should already
 be enough to surpass all other flavors.
 We never tire of delighting in this stillness.
 We feel a constant attraction to this stillness and calm in the heart.
 Wherever we go, wherever we stay, the mind has its own foundation.
 The heart is at ease, quiet and calm, so that now we must use discernment
 to investigate the elements and khandhas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important point to notice is the act of formation in the mind.
 Once something is formed, sañña immediately labels it — as if sankhara
 were forming things to hand on to sañña, which takes up where the sankhara
 leaves off.
 It then interprets these things from various angles — and this is where
 we get deluded.
 We fall for our own assumptions and interpretations, for our own shadows,
 which paint picture stories that have us engrossed or upset both day and
 night.
 Why are we engrossed? Why are we upset?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Engrossed or upset, it's because of the mind's shadows acting out stories
 and issues.
 This story.
 That story.
 Future issues.
 Things yet to come.
 Things yet to exist — nothing butthe mind painting pictures to delude itself.
 We live in our thought-formations, our picture-painting — engrossed and
 upset by nothing but our own thought-formations, our own picture-painting.
 In a single day there's not a moment when we're free from painting imaginary
 pictures to agitate and fool ourselves.
 Wise people, though, can keep up with the tricks and deceits of the khandhas,
 which is why they aren't deluded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moment when mindfulness and discernment really penetrate down is when
 we can know that this is actually the way the mind usually is.
 Like people who have never meditated: When they start meditating, they
 send their minds astray, without anything to hold on to.
 For example, they may have a meditation word, like 'buddho,' and there
 they sit — their eyes vacant, looking at who-knows-what.
 But their minds are thinking and painting 108 pictures with endless captions.
 They then become engrossed with them or wander aimlessly in line with the
 preoccupations they invent for themselves, falling for their preoccupations
 more than actually focusing on their meditation.
 They thus find it hard to settle their minds down because they don't have
 enough mindfulness supervising the work of meditation to make them settle
 down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have used our alertness and ingenuity in the areas of concentration
 and discernment, we will come to know clearly that these conditions come
 from the mind and then delude the mind whose mindfulness and discernment
 aren't quick enough to keep up with them.
 The heart causes us to follow after them deludedly, so that we can't find
 any peace of mind at all, even though our original aim was to meditate
 to find peace of mind.
 These deceptive thoughts engender love, hate, anger, irritation, without
 letup, no matter whether we are meditators or not — because as meditators
 we haven't set up mindfulness to supervise our hearts, and the result is
 that we're just as insane with our thoughts as anyone else.
 Old Grandfather Boowa has been insane this way himself, and that's no joke!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, no matter how many years in the past a certain issue may lie,
 this aimless, drifting heart wanders until it meets up with it and revives
 it.
 If it was something that made us sad, we become sad about it again, all
 on our own.
 We keep it smoldering and think it back to life, even though we don't know
 where the issue lay hidden in the meantime.
 These are simply the mind's own shadows deceiving it until they seem to
 take on substance and shape.
 As what? As anger, greed, anxiety, pain, insanity, all coming from these
 shadows.
 What sort of 'path' or 'fruition' is this? Paths and fruitions like this
 are so heaped all over the world that we can't find any way out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in investigating the acts of the mind, the important point is that discernmen
t be quick to keep up with their vagrant ways.
 When mindfulness and discernment are quick enough, then whatever forms
 in the mind, we will see that it comes from the mind itself, which is about
 to paint pictures to deceive itself, about to label and interpret sights,
 sounds, smells, and tastes of various kinds.
 The heart is then up on these preoccupations; and when it is up on them,
 they vanish immediately, with no chance of taking on substance or shape,
 of becoming issues or affairs.
 This is because mindfulness and discernment are wise to them, and so the
 issues are resolved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, we come to see the harm of which the mind is the sole cause.
 We don't praise or blame sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations
 at all.
 The heart turns and sees the harm that arises in the mind that deceives
 itself, saying, 'That's worth praising...
 worth criticizing...
 worth getting glad about...
 worth getting sad about.' It sees that the blame lies entirely with the
 mind.
 This mind is a cheat, a fraud, a deceiver.
 If we study it and keep watch of its ways through meditation, we will gain
 a thorough knowledge of its good and evil doings, until it lies within
 our grasp and can't escape us at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how we investigate when we investigate the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, other things will come to have no meaning or importance for
 us.
 The only important thing is this deceiving mind, so we must investigate
 this deceiver with mindfulness and discernment so that we can be wise to
 its tricks and deceits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fixing our attention on the mind, we have to act as if it were a culprit.
 Wherever it goes, we have to keep watch on it with mindfulness and discernment.
 Whatever thoughts it forms, mindfulness and discernment have to keep watch
 so as to be up on events.
 Each event — serious or not — keeps vanishing, vanishing.
 The heart knows clearly, 'This mind, and nothing else, is the real culprit.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visual objects aren't at fault.
 They don't give benefits or harm.
 Sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations don't give benefits or harm,
 because they themselves aren't benefits or harm.
 Only the mind is what fashions them and dresses them up so as to deceive
 itself into being gladdened or saddened, pleased or pained through the
 power of the preoccupations that arise only from the heart.
 Mindfulness and discernment see more and more clearly into these things,
 step by step, and then turn to see that all the fault lies with the mind.
 They no longer praise or blame other things as they used to.
 Once they have focused solely on the mind, which at the moment is the culprit,
 the time won't be long before they can catch the culprit and put an end
 to all our concerns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then.
 Whatever thoughts that may be formed are all an affair of the mind.
 The 'tigers and elephants' it forms are simply sankharas it produces to
 deceive itself.
 Mindfulness and discernment are up on events every time.
 Now the current of the cycle (vatta) keeps spiraling in, day by day, until
 we can catch the culprit — but we can't yet sentence him.
 We are now in the stage of deliberation to determine his guilt.
 Only when we can establish the evidence and the motive can we execute him
 in accordance with the procedures of 'Dhamma Penetration.' This is where
 we reach the crucial stage in mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the beginning, we used the elements and khandhas as our objects of investigat
ion, cleansing the mind with elements, using them as a whetstone to sharpen
 mindfulness and discernment.
 We cleansed the mind with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensation
s, using them as a whetstone to sharpen mindfulness and discernment; and
 we cleansed the mind itself with automatic mindfulness and discernment.
 Now at this stage we circle exclusively in on the mind.
 We don't pay attention to matters of sights, sounds, smells, or tastes,
 because we have already understood and let go of them, knowing that they
 aren't the causal factors.
 They aren't as important as this mind, which is the primary instigator
 — the culprit renowned throughout the circles of the cycle, the agitator,
 the disturber of the peace, creating havoc for itself only right here inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness and discernment probe inward and focus right here.
 Wherever this mind goes, it's the only thing causing harm.
 So we watch patiently over this culprit to see what he will do next — and
 aside from being alert to what he will do, we also have to use discernment
 to penetrate in and see who is inciting him.
 Who stands behind him, so that he must be constantly committing crimes?
 He keeps creating deceptive issues without pause — why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness and discernment dig in there, not simply to pounce on or lay
 siege to his behavior, but also to go right into his lair to see what motivatin
g force lies within it.
 What is the real instigator? There has to be a cause.
 If there's no cause, no supporting condition to spin the mind into action,
 the mind can't simply act on its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it simply acts on its own, then it has to be a matter of khandhas pure
 and simple — but here it's not pure and simple.
 Whatever behavior the mind displays, whatever issues it forms, all give
 rise to gladness or sadness.
 This shows that these conditions aren't 'simply' coming out.
 There's a cause.
 There's an underlying condition that sends them out, making them give rise
 to real pleasure and pain when we fall for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are exploring inward at this point, we have already seen that the
 mind is the culprit, so we must consider letting go of all external things.
 Our burdens grow less and less.
 There remain only the issues of the mind and the issues of formation and
 interpretation that arise solely from the mind.
 Mindfulness and discernment spin whizzing around in there and ultimately
 come to know what it is that causes the mind to form so many thoughts giving
 rise to love, anger, and hate.
 As soon as it appears, the heart knows it; and when the heart knows it,
 the 'Lord of Conventional Reality,' which is blended with the mind, dissolves
 away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point the cycle has been destroyed through mindfulness and discernment.
 The mind is no longer guilty, and turns into a mind absolutely pure.
 Once the problem of the cycle is ended, there is no way that we can find
 fault with the mind.
 When we could find fault, that was because the fault was still in the mind.
 It was hiding in the mind.
 Just as when criminals or enemies have taken up hiding in a cave: We have
 to destroy the cave as well, and can't conserve it out of affection for
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Avijja — unawareness — is the lord of the three levels of existence that
 has infiltrated the mind, and thus we have to consider destroying the entire
 thing.
 If the mind isn't genuine, it will dissolve together with unawareness.
 If it's genuine in line with its nature, it will become a pure mind — something
 peerless — because all things counterfeit have fallen away from it through
 the use of mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the counterfeit things that are like rust latching firmly onto the
 mind finally dissolve away through the power of mindfulness and discernment,
 the mind becomes genuine Dhamma.
 You can call it 'the genuine mind' or 'the genuine Dhamma': There's no
 contradiction, because there is no more reason for contradiction, which
 is an affair of defilement.
 You can say 100% that the flavor of the Dhamma has surpassed all other
 flavors.
 When the mind is pure Dhamma, it has had enough of all other things.
 It is absolutely no longer involved with anything else at all.
 It's one mind, one Dhamma.
 There is only one.
 There is only one genuine Dhamma.
 The mind is Dhamma, the Dhamma is the mind.
 That's all that can be said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ask each of you to take this and contemplate it.
 This is the basis for the truth of the teachings that the Lord Buddha taught
 from the beginning until the moment of his total nibbana.
 The purity of his mind was a deeply felt Dhamma that he experienced with
 his full heart.
 He then proclaimed that Dhamma, with the benevolence of his full heart,
 teaching the world up to the present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To call his teachings, 'the benevolence of the Lord Buddha' shouldn't be
 wrong, because he taught the world with true benevolence.
 When we take those teachings and put them into practice in a way that goes
 straight to the heart, we will come to see things we have never seen before,
 never known before, within this heart, step by step, until we reach the
 full level of practice, know the full level of knowledge, and gain release
 from suffering and stress with our full hearts, with nothing left latching
 on.
 This is called wiping out the cemeteries — the birth and death of the body
 and mind — for good.
 What a relief!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now that we've reached this point, I don't know what more to say, because
 I'm at a loss for words.
 I ask that you as meditators practice, train yourselves and explore all
 Dhammas until you too are at a loss of words like this speaker at his wits'
 end.
 Even though we may be stupid, infinitely stupid, I'll ask to express my
 admiration straight from the heart.

Feelings of Pain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Discourse on Good Omens (Mangala Sutta), the Buddha teaches us to
 associate with sages, and not with fools.
 The first and foremost fool here is our own heart.
 In other words, there are fools outside and fools inside, and for the most
 part the fools inside are the ones who keep stirring up trouble all the
 time.
 When we live with meditation masters, which is called associating with
 sages, we keep gaining lessons from sages, because that's what they are.
 They are wise in the various tactics they teach us.
 They have practiced and gained knowledge of everything from experience.
 Their teachings are thus correct, precise, and convincing to those who
 listen to them, with no room for any doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, Venerable Acariya Mun: There never was a time when he would
 teach saying, 'It seems to be like this.
 It seems to be like that.' There was nothing but, 'This is the way it is
 for sure, for sure' — and we were sure, because he spoke only the absolute
 truth taken right from a heart that had already known and seen, and from
 his own well-conducted practice.
 Especially in the case of illness: If there were any weak-willed cases,
 he would tell them, 'Whoever is weak, whoever cries and moans, can take
 his moans as his medicine.
 There's no need to search out medicine anywhere, no need to have anyone
 to look after him.
 His moans are his medicine.
 If moaning serves any purpose, then why search for medicine to treat the
 disease?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he would add, 'Keep moaning.
 Everyone can moan.
 Even children can moan — if it serves a purpose.
 But here it doesn't serve any purpose at all other than to annoy those
 good people who are unflinching in the practice.
 So you shouldn't moan out of weakness.
 You're a meditation monk.
 When you act like this, who can bear to see it? If you were a child or
 an ordinary person, there wouldn't be anything wrong with it, because they
 haven't received any training.
 They don't have any knowledge or understanding of the various ways to contend
 with the pain, such as contemplating it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'But you, you already know everything of every sort.
 Yet when trouble comes, such as illness, you can't find any methods or
 tactics to care for yourself.
 You just go all to pieces.
 This won't do at all.
 You're a shame to yourself and your fellow meditators.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Venerable Acariya Mun was very talented in teaching the heart.
 When those of his disciples who were intent on studying with him would
 listen to anything he'd say, it would go straight to the heart.
 Straight to the heart.
 The things we should put into practice, we would put into practice.
 The things we should understand right then, dealing with internal matters,
 we would understand — every time, step after step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we were ill, he would teach us how to contemplate.
 'When you have a fever, where did you get it from?' He'd say this so as
 to serve a purpose, as food for thought for meditators.
 'From where did you drag out the fever and chills? They arise in this body,
 don't they? When they disappear, where do they go, if not back to where
 they came from? Even if they don't disappear, they die together with each
 of us: There are no exceptions at all in this body.
 Investigate it so as to know it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'All stress, all pains are Noble Truths.
 If we don't investigate them, what are we going to investigate? The Buddha
 gained Awakening with the Noble Truths, his disciples gained Awakening
 with the Noble Truths — so are we going to gain Awakening with weakness?
 Would that be in keeping with the Dhamma of the Buddha? Then we've come
 to resist the Dhamma!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Where does the pain arise? In which part? Ask so as to find out.
 When it hurts here and aches there, who is it that hurts? Who is it that
 aches? Probe on in to find what instigates it.
 Where does it come from? Where does it hurt? What causes it to hurt? What
 perceives it as pain? When the body dies and they cremate it, does it hurt?
 Who is it that deceives itself into thinking that this hurts or that aches?
 Investigate so as to find its initial causes.

'If you're a meditator who doesn't know initial causes and doesn't know
 their effects — this heap of suffering — then how are you going to cure
 suffering? What is your discernment for? Why don't you think? Why don't
 you find it and put it to use?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Your mindfulness and discernment are for keeping things in mind and investigati

\begin_layout Standard
He would keep stressing his points, step by step.
 If the person listening was intent on listening — and especially if he
 had any fighting spirit — he'd find it easy to grasp the point, and it
 would appeal to him immediately.
 Immediately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we'd leave Venerable Acariya Mun to live in any spot suitable for the
 practice, his teachings would seem to reverberate through the heart.
 You could remember every facet of his teachings, every important point
 that should be used as a tool in the practice.
 For example, if you were staying in a challenging place, it was if he were
 right there in the heart.
 The heart would be really audacious and exultant in practicing, knowing
 the Dhamma, seeing it, understanding it.
 You would understand with audacity, and with a warrior's spirit — not by
 being discouraged, irresolute, or beating a retreat.
 That's not the way to make the defilements fear you and disappear from
 the heart.
 That's not at all the way to cure defilement, to know the affairs of defilement
 or to be able to remove them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the religion! There is nothing to compare with it in being so correct,
 so precise, so genuine, so true, so indisputable.
 If we all were to follow the principles of the religion, there would be
 no need for prisons or jails.
 What need would they serve? Nobody would be doing any wrong! People would
 see in line with reason and acknowledge their rightness and wrongness,
 their good and their evil, using the principles of reason as their standard.
 We human beings would then be able to live with one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason we need laws, prisons, and jails is because we don't admit our
 wrongs.
 When we're wrong, we don't admit that we're wrong.
 Even the moment after we see ourselves do something wrong, we won't admit
 to it.
 Even when we're put in jail and are asked, we still say, 'They accused
 me of stealing this and stealing that' — even though we ourselves actually
 stole it.
 This is simply an unwillingness to admit to things in line with reason,
 in line with the truth.
 Even within the heart, with things that concern us exclusively, the same
 holds true: We don't admit to them, which is why we receive so much pain
 and suffering.
 If we admit to the principles of the truth, the things that appear in line
 with the truth can be resolved through the truth.
 For example, even when pain arises in the body, it won't disrupt the mind
 because our knowledge is wise to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the principles of the Dhamma say, pains have been appearing in our body
 and mind ever since we first became aware of things.
 There is no reason for us to get excited, frightened, or upset by them
 to the point where they disease the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why mental development, or meditation, is an excellent science for
 gaining knowledge on all fronts: Those who practice consistently are not
 upset when pain arises in the body.
 They can even focus on the spot where the pain arises so as to investigate
 and analyze it in line with its truth until gaining skillful and courageous
 tactics for dealing with it admirably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important point is to associate with sages, wise people, those who are
 sharp and astute.
 If we aren't yet able to depend on ourselves, we have to depend on our
 teachers to instruct us.
 If we listen often, their teachings gradually seep into us and blend with
 our temperament until our mind becomes a mind with Dhamma.
 Our mind becomes a sage, a wise person, and can eventually take care of
 itself, becoming 'atta hi attano natho' — its own mainstay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in every activity where we aren't yet capable, we first have to depend
 on others.
 In living with those who are good, we are bound to find peace and happiness.
 Our traits come to mesh with theirs — this is important — until our own
 traits become good and admirable as well.
 It's the same as if we were to associate with bad people: At first we aren't
 bad, but as we associate with them for a long time, our traits blend themselves
 with theirs until we become bad without being aware of it.
 When we are fully bad, this makes us even more blind.
 We feel that we've become even better.
 No one else can push us around.
 Otherwise our 'goodness' will jump into action — the 'goodness' of a bad
 person, an evil that wise people everywhere fear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bad people and good people.
 Evil and good.
 These things get turned around in this way.
 Bad people thus can't see the truth that they are bad, and so flatter themselve
s into thinking, 'I'm good.
 I'm smart.
 I'm clever.
 I'm one of the most renowned operators around.' That's how they twist things!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, associating with meditation masters, with sages, is important
 for anyone who is striving to become a good person, who is hoping to prosper
 and be happy, because sages will teach us often.
 Their manners and deportment that we see day after day will gradually seep
 into and nurture our minds.
 We can hold to them continually as good examples, for everything they do
 in every way is all Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially if they're people devoid of defilement, then there is nothing
 to compare with them.
 Like Venerable Acariya Mun: I'm certain that he was devoid of defilement.
 After hearing the Dhamma from him, I had no doubts.
 He himself never said that he was devoid of defilement, you know.
 He never said that he was an arahant or anything, but he would say it in
 his ability to explain the true Dhamma on every level in a way that would
 go straight to the heart and erase all doubt for all those who came to
 study with him.
 This is why I can dare to say unabashedly that Venerable Acariya Mun Bhuridatta
 Thera is one of the important arahants of our day and age — an age in which
 arahants are exceedingly rare, because it's an age sadly lacking in people
 practicing the Dhamma for the sake of arahantship.
 Instead, we practice to eliminate arahantship by amassing all kinds of
 miscellaneous defilements.
 This holds for all of us, so no one is in a position to criticize anyone
 else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's return to the subject of feelings: To investigate feelings of pain
 is very important.
 This is something I learned from Venerable Acariya Mun.
 He took this very seriously whenever any of the meditators in his monastery
 became ill.
 Sometimes he would go himself and ask, 'How are you contemplating your
 illness?' Then he'd really emphasize the Dhamma.
 'Go probing right there.
 Wherever there's pain, investigate so as to see the truth of the pain.'
 He'd teach how to investigate: 'Don't retreat.
 To retreat is to enhance the pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'To be a warrior, you have fight using discernment.
 This is what will bring victory: the ability to keep up with the feeling
 of pain that you hold to be an important enemy.
 Actually, that feeling isn't anyone's enemy.
 It doesn't have any sense of consciousness at all.
 It's simply a truth — that's all.
 So investigate on in.
 You don't have to anticipate it or concern yourself with whether it's a
 big pain or a small pain.
 All that's asked is that you know its truth with your own discernment,
 so that the heart won't deceive you.' That's what he would say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, our heart is deceit incarnate, because that which deceives is
 within the heart and fools the heart into making assumptions and interpretation
s.
 Stupidity has an easy time believing lies.
 Clever people have an easy time deceiving stupid people.
 Deceit has an easy time fooling stupidity.
 The cleverness of the defilements gets along well with our own stupidity.
 This is why the Dhamma teaches us to ferret things out to investigate down
 to their truth and then to believe in line with that truth.
 This is our means of gaining victory step by step.
 Ferret out the pains that are always with you so as to see them.
 Don't run away from them.
 Whether they're big or small, investigate right there.
 Investigate right there.
 If you're going to concentrate, concentrate right there.
 When you are investigating its causes, no matter how great the pain, keep
 probing in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thing we call pain: What does it depend on as its foundation? It depends
 on the body as its foundation.
 It depends on our attention as its means of flaring up — in other words,
 the attention that labels it in various ways: This is what makes pain flare
 up.
 We have to cure this kind of attention by investigating to know both the
 pain — what it's like — and the place where pain arises, in whatever part
 of the body.
 Try to know clearly whether or not that spot is really pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if there's pain in the bone, in any part of the skin or flesh,
 the skin and the flesh are skin and flesh.
 The pain is a pain.
 Even though they dwell together, they are separate things, not one and
 the same.
 The mind — the knower that is aware of these things — is a mind, but it's
 a deluded mind, so it assumes that this is pain, that's pain, and conflates
 these things into being its 'self,' saying, 'I hurt here.
 I hurt there.
 I don't want myself to be pained.
 I want the pain to vanish.' This desire is a defilement that encourages
 pain and suffering to arise.
 The heart is pained.
 The feeling of pain in the body is pain.
 The pain in the heart flares up with that pain, because it wants it to
 follow the heart's desires.
 These things keep feeding each other.
 This is our own stupidity, loading us down with suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be intelligent, we have to investigate, to watch the feeling of pain
 in the heart.
 What does it come from? What does it depend on? It depends on the body.
 Which part of the body? From what spot in the body does the pain arise?
 Look at the body and the feeling: Are they one and the same thing? What
 kind of shape and features do they have? The feeling doesn't have any shape
 or features or a posture of any kind.
 It simply appears as a feeling of pain, that's all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the body, it has a shape, a color, and complexion — and it stays
 as it was before the pain arose.
 When the pain arises, it stays just as it was.
 Actually, the pain is something separate from this.
 It simply depends on a malfunction of the body to arise.
 The mind is what takes notice of it.
 If the mind has any discernment, it should notice it in line with its truth.
 The mind then won't be affected by it.
 But if the mind is deluded, it latches onto the pain — in other words,
 it pulls that pain in to be its 'self' — and then wants that pain, which
 it says is its self, to disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why we can't analyze it.
 Once the pain is our self, how can we separate it out? If it's simply a
 pain, a separate reality, then the body is a separate reality.
 They aren't one and the same.
 Each one exists separately.
 Each is a separate reality in line with its nature.
 Only when our awareness is like this can we analyze things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as long as we see the pain as our self, then we can analyze it all day
 long and not get anywhere, because once we hold that, 'This is myself,'
 how can we analyze it? We haven't separated these things with discernment,
 so we have to keep holding onto them as our self.
 When the khandhas and the mind blend into one, we can't analyze them.
 But when we try to use mindfulness and discernment to investigate in to
 see the truth of these things — that each exists separately, each has its
 separate reality, which holds true for us and for everyone else — and this
 realization goes deep into the heart, then the pain gradually fades away,
 fades away.
 At the same time, we know what makes the connection from the pain into
 the heart, because the connection comes from the heart.
 When we investigate the pain, it comes retracting into the heart.
 All the affairs of pain come from the heart that labels or that experiences
 mental pain because of an insidious connection by way of attachment (upadana)
 that we don't yet know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we investigate so as to see clearly, we follow the feeling of pain
 inward.
 We come in knowing, knowing.
 The pain keeps retracting and retracting, into the heart.
 Once we know that the heart is what created the attachment, making itself
 construe the pain to be itself, creating a great deal of suffering-once
 we know this, the pain disappears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or — alternatively — once we know this, the pain stays real, but the heart
 doesn't latch onto it.
 Even though the pain may not disappear, the mind is the mind.
 It doesn't make any connection through attachment.
 Each is its own separate reality.
 This is called the mind being its own self — cool, calm, and collected
 — in the midst of the pain of the khandhas.
 This is to know that the mind is a reality just as each khandha is a separate
 reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the path for those who are practicing so as to become wise to the
 five khandhas, with feelings of pain as their primary focus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But for those who understand all the way, to the point of reaching 'the
 unshakable mind, the unshakable Dhamma' (akuppa-citta, akuppa-dhamma) that
 can't be provoked into being anything else, there is no problem at all.
 Whether pain is little or great, they have absolutely no problem because
 their minds are always true.
 There is never a time when their minds, which are already pure, can become
 defiled, can become 'worlded.' There's no way it could happen.
 For this reason, whatever conditions the khandhas may display, such people
 know them in line with the principles of nature.
 The khandhas themselves appear in line with the principles of nature and
 disappear in line with nature.
 They remain naturally and then disappear naturally.
 The mind knows in line with its own nature, without having to be forced
 or coerced in any way.
 The minds of those who know totally all-around are like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for those of us who are investigating the khandhas to know them and withdraw
 from them step by step, even though our minds are not yet like that while
 we are practicing, even though our hopes aren't yet fulfilled, still our
 investigation of pain is for the purpose of separating the mind from the
 pain so that it's not entangled in pain, so that whenever pain arises in
 greater or lesser measure, the mind doesn't cling to the pain as being
 itself.
 We do this so as not to gather up the pain as being our self — which would
 be the same as taking fire to burn ourself.
 When we can do this, we can be at our ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So pain is an excellent whetstone for discernment.
 However much pain arises, set your mindfulness and discernment focused
 right there.
 Turn to look at the mind, and then expand your awareness to encompass the
 feeling and the body, each of which is already a separate part.
 The body is one part, the feeling is another, and the mind another.
 Keep going back and forth among them, investigating with discernment until
 you understand — and it really goes to the heart — that, 'Each khandha
 is simply...
 and that's all.' None of them appears to be any such thing as 'you' or 'yours.'
 They are simply different realities that appear, and that's all.
 When you understand clearly like this, the heart becomes its own free and
 independent self at that moment and it knows that the mind and the khandhas
 are separate realities, neither affecting the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even at the moment when you are about to die, the heart will be up on events
 in the immediate present.
 It won't be shaken by pain and death because it is sure that the mind is
 the mind: a stronghold of awareness.
 Each khandha is simply a condition.
 The mind thus doesn't fear death because it is sure of itself that it won't
 get destroyed anywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though it may not have yet reached the level where it's absolutely
 devoid of defilement, the mind has still prepared itself using discernment
 with the khandhas so that it's supreme.
 In other words, it lives with the Noble Truths.
 It lives with its whetstone for discernment.
 Discernment will spread its power far and wide.
 The heart will grow more and more radiant, more and more courageous, because
 discernment is what cleanses it.
 Even if death comes at that moment, there's no problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For one thing, if you use mindfulness and discernment to investigate pain
 without retreating, to the point where you understand it, then even when
 you really are about to die, you'll know that the pain will disappear first.
 The mind won't disappear.
 It will revert into itself, knowing exclusively within itself, and then
 pass on at that moment.
 The phrase, 'Mindfulness lapses,' doesn't exist for a person who has practiced
 the Dhamma to this level.
 We can thus be sure that a person with mindfulness, even though he or she
 may not be devoid of defilement, will still be clearly aware at the moment
 when pain arises in full force to the point where the khandhas can no longer
 endure and will break apart — will die.
 The mind will withdraw itself from all that and revert to its 'mindness'
 — to being its own independent self — and then pass on.
 This is a very high, very refined level of Dhamma!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, meditators who are resolute and unflinching for the sake
 of knowing every level of the Dhamma tend to be earnest in investigating
 pain.
 When the time comes for them to know, the knowledge goes straight to the
 heart.
 They regard their pain as a Noble Truth in line with the Buddha's teaching
 that all living beings are fellows in pain, birth, aging, illness, and
 death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when investigating the khandhas so as to know them in line with their
 truth, you shouldn't try to thwart or resist the truth.
 For example, if the body can't endure, let it go.
 You shouldn't cherish it.
 As for the pain, it will go on its own.
 This is called sugato — faring well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the way of investigating the mind and training the heart that gives
 clear results to those who meditate.
 They have meditated in the way I've described so that when the time of
 death is really upon them, they don't hope to depend on anyone at all —
 parents, brothers, sisters, relatives, friends, anyone.
 They have to withdraw the mind from all things that entangle and involve
 it so as to enter that crucial spot where they are engaged in hand-to-hand
 combat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At a time such as this, at the moment when you are about to die, take pain
 as the focal point for investigation.
 Don't be willing to retreat — come what may! All that's asked is that you
 know and understand this point.
 Don't go thinking that if you die while being embroiled in investigating
 pain like this — while the mind is in the midst of this commotion — you'll
 go to a bad bourn.
 Why should you go to a bad bourn? You're embroiled, but with a noble task.
 You're embroiled with knowledge, or for the sake of knowledge, and not
 because of delusion.
 The mind is focused on investigating and probing pain.
 When the time comes for it really to go, this knowing mind — the mind with
 mindfulness knows — will withdraw instantly into itself.
 It will let go immediately of the work at hand and withdraw into itself,
 to be itself — the mind and nothing but — and then pass on like a 'sugato'
 with the full capability of a meditator, even though we may not yet be
 devoid of defilement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is called having full strength to our full capacity, in line with our
 level of mind and Dhamma.
 Investigation and mental development are thus important matters, matters
 on which our life and death depend.
 We needn't hope to depend on anyone else at all — of this we are certain
 within ourselves.
 The heart knows within itself how strong mindfulness and discernment are,
 and needn't go asking anyone else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the heart is able to investigate to the point where it can pass on at
 that moment, all doubts vanish.
 There are no problems at all.
 If you think that because you're a woman or because you're a layperson,
 you can't realize nibbana, that's your own misconception, which is one
 kind of defilement deceiving you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma is a truth and everyone's common property.
 Whether we are men or women, lay or ordained, we can all have mindfulness
 and discernment.
 We can all cure our defilements.
 When we are willing, any man or woman, any monk or layperson can use any
 of the methods to cure defilement and gain release.
 We needn't create problems to plague our hearts and waste our time.
 'Since when do I have the potential to do that?' Don't think that! You're
 developing the merit and potential right now! However much or little, you
 can see it right here in the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should examine ourselves.
 Wherever we are stupid, we should develop intelligence: mindfulness and
 discernment.
 Only then will we be doing what is genuinely right in terms of the principles
 of the Lord Buddha's Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we criticize ourselves, thinking, 'That person is on this level or that
 level while we don't have any level at all; wherever we go, this person
 gets ahead of us, that person gets ahead of us,' actually nobody is getting
 ahead of us except for the defilements that get ahead of us and deceive
 us into feeling inferior and depressed, into thinking that we have only
 a little potential.
 That's simply a misconception aimed at making us discouraged and self-pitying,
 because defilement is looking for a way to kill us without our realizing
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We shouldn't think in those ways.
 We are full of potential — all of us.
 And why shouldn't we be? We're meditators.
 We're all devoted to making merit.
 Potential isn't something we can set out on the market to compete with
 one another.
 Every person has potential within him or herself.
 We're taught not to belittle one another's potential.
 Even with animals, we're taught not to belittle them — think of that! —
 because potential lies in the heart of every person and every animal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when curing defilement, you needn't waste time thinking those things.
 They'll simply ruin your morale and your resolve.
 To think, 'I'm a worthless woman...
 a worthless man...
 a worthless monk...
 a worthless layperson.
 I don't have any paths or fruitions at all.
 Other people have them, but I don't.
 I'm ashamed to show them my face' — these are wrong thoughts that will
 spoil your resolve in developing the various forms of goodness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right way to think is this: 'Right now I'm making an effort, with mindfulnes
s and discernment, to cure defilement and to develop what is good and meritoriou
s step by step, which is the direct way to develop my perfections (parami).
 I have the potential.
 I was born in the midst of the Buddha's teachings and have developed the
 potential and the perfections to my full capacity all along up to the present.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Women can have mindfulness and discernment just like men, because women
 and men both have defilements, and defilements are cured with mindfulness
 and discernment — backed by persistent effort — both by men and by women.
 And where do they have defilements? They both have defilements in the heart.
 When mindfulness and discernment are complete, women and men can both pass
 over and beyond — with no question of their having to be ordained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the truth of the Noble Truths, which are not particular about status,
 nationality, or any of the human races, and which are not particular about
 the male or the female sex.
 All that's asked is that we strive, because the Dhamma is common to us
 all.
 Women and men, lay and ordained, we can all listen to it, understand it,
 practice it, and cure defilement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The defilements don't favor men or women.
 We all have defilements.
 Even monks have defilements: What do you say to that? Monks thus have to
 cure their own defilements.
 If they don't, they lie buried in defilement just like people in general
 who aren't interested in the Dhamma — or even worse than people in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma thus doesn't stipulate that it's only for those who are ordained.
 What is stipulated is that we cure defilement with persistent effort.
 This is something very important.
 We have to be very interested in this point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for release from suffering and stress, where do we gain release? We gain
 it right here, right where there is suffering.
 If we can cure defilement, we gain release from suffering.
 If we can't, then no matter what our sex or status, we all have to suffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here.
 This is where the religion lies, here in the heart.
 It doesn't lie anywhere else.
 If we want to be incapable of it, we can be incapable — right here in our
 heart.
 Whether lay or ordained, we can be incapable — if we make ourselves incapable.
 Or we can make the religion flourish in our heart — that we can also do.
 When the religion flourishes, where does it flourish? In the heart, and
 nowhere else.
 The important point is the heart.
 The important point is our practice: the actions, the manners we display.
 When the heart develops, the various aspects of our behavior develop beautifull
y.
 Admirably.
 In particular, the heart flourishes within itself.
 It has mindfulness and discernment looking after it constantly.
 This is called a flourishing heart.
 The defilements can hardly ever come to damage it: That's when the religion
 flourishes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should make an effort to examine and straighten things out step by step.
 The defilements, you know, are no wider or greater than the limits of our
 ability to cure and remove them.
 They're only here in the heart, so investigate right here.
 Whether we're men or women, lay or ordained, we all have defilements in
 our hearts.
 No matter how thick they may be, if we consider them we can know them.
 They're like darkness: Even though darkness may have existed for aeons,
 all we have to do is turn on a light, and the darkness disappears completely.
 The darkness doesn't have any way to brag, saying, 'I've been dark for
 aeons, so there's no way that this puny light can chase my darkness away.'
 When the causes are ready, the darkness has to disappear completely, and
 brightness appears in its place.
 Even though the darkness may have existed for aeons, it all vanishes in
 that instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the defilements may be thick and may have been lording it over
 our heart for a long time, we should investigate them thoroughly with mindfulne
ss and discernment.
 When mindfulness and discernment are capable, they immediately become all-aroun
d.
 The defilements, even though they may have been in the heart for aeons,
 will immediately disintegrate, in the same way that the darkness that had
 existed vanishes as soon as a light is lit.
 Brightness arises instead, through the power of mindfulness and discernment.
 Within the heart it is dazzlingly bright at that moment with 'dhammo padipo'
 — the light of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is all there is.
 This is the important point we have to investigate.
 Be sure to see it.
 The religion is marvelous — where is it marvelous? The religion flourishes
 — where does it flourish? The Buddha says to gain release from stress —
 where is it gained? It exists only here in the heart.
 To analyze it, there are the four Noble Truths: stress, its origin, its
 cessation, and the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Stress (dukkha): We know it's stress because we aren't dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The origin of stress (samudaya): This is what fosters or produces stress.
 What forms does it take? We're taught, 'Craving...
 embued with passion and delight, relishing now here and now there; i.e.,
 craving for sensual pleasure, craving for being, craving for not-being.'
 This we know.
 Whatever the mind may love or crave, we should try to straighten it out.
 It loves and craves the five khandhas, and especially the five khandhas
 that it says are 'me.' So try to become wise to these things, step by step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there's more love and craving: love and craving for the mind, attachmen
t to the mind, cherishing the mind.
 So straighten out the mind.
 Wherever it feels love, that's where defilement is.
 Keep going in, straightening things out, until you've reached the truth.
 Then the heart will have no love or hate, because they are all gone.
 The defilements are all gone.
 The mind has no love, no hate, no anger.
 It's a pure principle of nature within itself.
 This is the nature we truly want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Investigating for the sake of Dhamma: This is the path (magga), with mindfulnes
s and discernment its important factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 The cessation of stress (nirodha): Stress stops, step by step, until the
 path is fully capable and nirodha stops all stress in the heart without
 leaving a trace.
 When nirodha has finished stopping stress, that which knows that stress
 has stopped and defilement has stopped...
 that which knows is 'the pure one.' This pure one lies beyond the Noble
 Truths as a marvelous, extraordinary Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Noble Truths are activities, conditions, conventions.
 Even nirodha is a convention.
 It's the activity of stopping stress.
 It's a conventional reality.
 When stress is completely stopped, nothing remains.
 All that remains is an entirely pure awareness.
 This is not a Noble Truth.
 It's the purity of the mind.
 If you want, you can call it nibbana.
 There's nothing against calling it whatever you want.
 When we reach this level, there are no conflicts — no conflicts, no disagreemen
ts with anyone at all.
 We don't conflict with ourselves; we don't conflict with anything.
 Our knowledge is wise to everything, so we can say what we like.
 There are no problems at all.
 All I ask is that you know this marvelous, extraordinary Dhamma.
 Its excellence exists of its own accord, without our having to confer titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, then, is the genuine religion.
 Probe right here.
 Probe on in.
 When in the practice of the religion we come to know, we'll know right
 here.
 If the religion is to flourish, it will flourish right here.
 The Buddha, in teaching the beings of the world to gain release from suffering,
 taught right here — and release is gained right here, nowhere else.
 We qualify as beings of the world and lie within the net of the Buddha's
 teachings.
 We're in the Buddha's following.
 Each of us has the right to practice and remove defilement so as to go
 beyond suffering and stress.
 All of us in the four groups of the Buddha's following (parisa) have the
 right to realize ourselves and reach nibbana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 I ask that you contemplate.
 Investigate.
 Be brave in fighting the things that should be fought within the heart.
 Develop courage.
 Develop mindfulness and discernment until they are sufficient.
 Search for various tactics for probing: These we should develop within
 ourselves.
 To probe on our own is the right way.
 It's our own wealth.
 Teachers lend us bits and pieces, which are merely fragments to serve as
 hints or as leads for us to contemplate so that they'll grow and branch
 out into our own wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any Dhamma that's a wealth coming from our own tactics: That's truly our
 own wealth.
 We'll never exhaust it.
 If we can think and probe cunningly in removing defilements until they
 fall away completely, using the tactics we develop on our own from the
 ideas our teachers lend us as starting capital, that's our own Dhamma.
 However much may arise, it's all our own Dhamma.
 What we derive from the texts is the Buddha's — and we borrow it from him.
 What we get from our teachers, we borrow from them — except when we are
 listening to them teach and we understand the Dhamma and cure defilement
 at that moment: That's our wealth while we are listening.
 After that, we take their tactics to contemplate until they branch out
 through our own ingenuity.
 This is our own wealth, in terms both of the causes — our contemplation
 — and of the outcome, the satisfactory results we gain step by step all
 the way to release from suffering and stress — and that's entirely ours.
 It stays with us, and no one can come to divide up any of our share at
 all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where the excellence becomes excellent.
 It doesn't become excellent anywhere else.
 So try to find the excellence, the peerlessness that lies within you, by
 striving and being energetic.
 Other than this awareness, there's no excellence at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But at present the heart is concealed by things that are filthy and worthless,
 and so it too has become something that lacks its proper worth.
 Right now we are washing it, peeling away the various kinds of defilement,
 step by step.
 When we have used our full strength to peel them all away until there aren't
 any left in the heart, then the heart is fully pure.
 Excellence appears here in this heart — and so the excellence is excellent
 right here.
 We don't have to search anywhere for anything more, for we have fully reached
 the 'land of enough.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then.
 I'll ask to stop here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Investigating Pain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We human beings are like trees: If we water a tree, fertilize it, and keep
 looking after it, it will be fresher and grow faster than it normally would
 if we let it fend for itself without our help.
 The mind, when we keep looking after it, will become more and more radiant
 and peaceful, step by step.
 If it isn't trained, it's like a tree that isn't looked after.
 Whenever it lacks training, it begins to act tarnished and defiled because
 the things that tarnish and defile it are already there inside it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look after the mind continually with meditation, it will gradually
 become more and more calm.
 When it's calm, it will begin to develop radiance along with its calm.
 And once it's calm, then when we contemplate anything, we can penetrate
 into the workings of cause and effect so as to understand in line with
 the truths that appear both within us and without.
 But if the mind is clouded and confused, its thoughts are all worthless.
 Right becomes wrong, and wrong becomes progressively even more wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we are taught to train the mind so that it will be quiet, calm, and
 radiant, able to see its shadows, just as when water is limpid and clear:
 We look down into the water and can see clearly whatever plants or animals
 there are.
 But if the water is muddy, we can't see anything when we look down into
 it.
 No matter what's there in the water — plants, animals, or whatever — we
 can't see them at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same holds true with the mind.
 If it's clouded, then we can't see the harm of whatever — big or small
 — is hidden within it, even though that harm has been bad for the mind
 all along.
 This is because the mind isn't radiant.
 For this reason, a mind clouded with muddy preoccupations can't investigate
 to the point of seeing anything, which is why we have to train the mind
 to make it radiant, and then it will see its shadows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These shadows lie buried in the mind.
 In other words, they're the various conditions that come out of the mind.
 They're called shadows — and we're forever deluded into being attached
 to these shadows that come from the thoughts constantly forming and coming
 out of the mind at all times.
 They catch us off guard, so that we think 'this' is us, 'that' is us, anything
 at all is us, even though they are simply shadows and not the real thing.
 Our belief or delusion, though, turns them into the 'real thing.' As a result,
 we end up troubled and anxious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At present, the great respected meditation masters on whom we depend in
 the area of the practice and in the area of the mind are falling away one
 by one.
 Those who are left can barely take care of themselves.
 Physically, they are wearing out step by step — like Venerable Acariya
 Khao.
 To see him is really heart-rending.
 When the body reaches its final extremity, it's as if it had never been
 strong or in radiant health.
 To lie down is painful, to sit is painful — whatever the position, it's
 painful.
 When the time comes for pain to come thronging in, the khandhas are nothing
 but pain.
 But for people like this, it's simply a matter of the body and the khandhas.
 In the area of the mind, they have no more problems about the behavior
 of the body or the khandhas at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as for us, well, we're always there welcoming such problems.
 No matter whether it's the body or the thoughts of the mind that are acting
 adversely, the mind begins to act adversely as well.
 For example, if the body is malfunctioning, the mind begins to malfunction
 too, even though there is nothing really wrong with it.
 This is due to the mind's own fear, caused by the fact that mindfulness
 and discernment aren't up on the events surrounding the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why we're taught to train our mindfulness and discernment to be
 capable and bold, alert to events arising within the mind and around it
 — namely, in the various aspects of the khandhas when they behave in adverse
 ways.
 We have to be alert to these things.
 All that's needed is for the mind not to be alert, or for it to be deluded
 by these things, and it will create stress and pain for itself without
 ceasing.
 Pain will have to come pouring in to overwhelm it.
 Even though the body may be pained simply in accordance with its own affairs,
 in accordance with the principles of nature, the mind will still grab hold
 of it to cause pain for itself, to burn itself, if it hasn't investigated
 to see through these things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the mind has mindfulness constantly governing and guarding it, then whatever
 damage arises will be minor, because it arises in a single spot — within
 the mind — and mindfulness is there at the same spot, alert to the fact
 that this is arising, that is arising, good or evil is arising within.
 Discernment is what unravels, contemplates, investigates, and remedies
 the different preoccupations arising in the mind.
 Things then begin to calm down.
 But if mindfulness is lacking, things begin to get drawn out.
 Even though thought-formations may arise and vanish, one after another,
 countless times, sañña — labels and interpretations — don't vanish.
 They connect things into long stretches.
 Stress and pain will then have to connect into long stretches and gather
 into the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart is what then reaps all this suffering by itself because of the
 acts (kamma) that sañña and sankhara fashion.
 The heart is the primary vessel for receiving both pleasure and pain —
 and for the most part it receives pain.
 If it lacks mindfulness and discernment, it receives only fakes and scraps.
 Rubbish.
 Things toxic and dangerous.
 But if it's mindful and discerning, it can pick and choose.
 Whatever isn't good, it picks out and throws away, leaving only the things
 of substance and worth within the heart.
 The heart is cooled, but not with water.
 It feels pleasure, but not because of external things.
 It's cool from the Dhamma.
 It feels pleasure in the Dhamma — and the reason is because mindfulness
 and discernment are looking after it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To attend to other things is not as difficult as attending to the heart.
 All the burdens of the world converge at the heart, and so to remove the
 things that have long been buried within us is very difficult work.
 We may even become discouraged because we see almost no results when we
 first begin.
 This is because the mind is still drifting while we work.
 It doesn't really focus on taking its work seriously, and so results don't
 appear as they should.
 This makes us discouraged, weak, and dejected.
 We give up, thinking, 'It'd be better to stop, because we're not getting
 anywhere' — even though once we have stopped it's not any better, except
 that the mind has a better chance of filling itself with evil after we've
 stopped striving toward the good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption that says 'better' is the work of the defilements, which
 are all deceivers, tricking us into being discouraged and weak.
 Actually, even while we are striving, things aren't yet getting good, even
 though we are practically dying to make them good.
 Our heart is ready to burst because of the effort — so how can things become
 good once we stop? If, as we think, things were to get good once we stop,
 then no one should have to do work of any sort any more.
 Once we stop, everything of every sort would become good on its own! Both
 within and without, things would have to be good.
 We won't have to do much work.
 It's better to stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma isn't like the defilements.
 The defilements say, 'It's better to stop.' It's better, all right — better
 for the sake of defilement, not for the sake of the Dhamma.
 The Dhamma is something with which we have to keep persevering until it's
 good, and then better, and then even better, continually, because we don't
 stop.
 This work is our work, which we do for the sake of Dhamma.
 It's not lazy work, which is the work of the defilements.
 The results of the work will then appear step by step because we do it
 without ceasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how it is with the work of meditation.
 When it's easy, we do it; when it's hard, we do it — because it's work
 that ought to be done.
 If we don't do it, who will do it for us? When the fires of pain and suffering
 are consuming the heart because of the thoughts we form and accumulate,
 why don't we complain that it's hard? When we accumulate defilement to
 cause stress and anxiety to the heart, why don't we feel that it's difficult?
 Why don't we complain about the stress? Because we're content to do it.
 We're not bothered with whether it's easy or hard.
 It simply flows — like water flowing downhill.
 Whether it's hard or not, it simply flows on its own, so that we don't
 know whether it's hard or not.
 But when we force ourselves to do good, it's like rolling a log uphill.
 It's hard because it goes against the grain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In relinquishing the sufferings, big and small, to which the mind submits
 in the course of the cycle of rebirth, some of the work just naturally
 has to be difficult.
 Everyone — even those who have attained the paths, the fruitions, and nibbana
 easily — has found it hard at first.
 When we reach the stage where it should be easy, it'll have to be easy.
 When we reach the stage we call hard, it'll have to be hard, but it won't
 always be hard like this.
 When the time comes for it to be light or easy, it's easy.
 And especially when we've come to see results appearing step by step, the
 difficulty disappears on its own, because we're completely ready for it,
 with no concern for pleasure or pain.
 We simply want to know, to see, to understand the things on which our sights
 are set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Study.
 We should study the elements and khandhas.
 We should keep watch on the elements and khandhas coming into contact with
 us.
 This is an important principle for all meditators.
 We should keep watch on them all the time because they keep changing all
 the time.
 They're 'aniccam' all the time, 'dukkham' all the time, without respite,
 without stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Investigate.
 We should keep trying to see their affairs as they occur within us, until
 we're adept at it.
 As we keep investigating again and again, the mind will gradually come
 to understand more and more profoundly, straight to the heart.
 The heart will gradually let go, of its own accord.
 It's not the case that we investigate once and then stop, waiting to rake
 in the results even though the causes aren't sufficient.
 That's not how it works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All forms of striving for the good — such as meditating — have to go against
 the grain of the defilements.
 All of the great meditation masters, before becoming famous and revered
 by the world, survived death through great efforts.
 If this were easy work, how could we say they survived death? It had to
 be heavy work that required that they exert themselves to the utmost.
 Most of these masters have since passed away.
 Only a few are left.
 We hope to depend on them, but their bodies are 'aniccam.' We can depend
 on them only for a period, only for a time, and then we are parted, as
 we have seen at present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we should try to take their teachings inward, as our masters, always
 teaching us inside.
 Whatever they have taught, we should take inward and put into practice.
 This way we can be said to be staying with our teachers at all times, just
 as if we were to be with the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha everywhere and
 always.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our own practice is the primary mainstay on which we can rely with assurance.
 Depending on a teacher isn't certain or sure.
 We are bound to be parted.
 If he doesn't leave, we leave.
 If he doesn't go, we go — because he and we all live in the same world
 of inconstancy.
 There is no difference among us.
 What we can hold to, though, are the basic principles of his teaching.
 We hold to them and earnestly put them into practice so as to see the results,
 so as to seize victory within the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Victory of this sort is the supreme victory, unsurpassed in all the world.
 No other victory is its equal.
 We grapple to take victory over ourselves — over the defilements that we
 have believed to be 'ourselves,' 'us,' 'ours,' for aeons and aeons.
 This is an enormous undertaking.
 If you play at it, like children playing with dolls, the defilements will
 crush you to bits in no time, because you've been holding onto them for
 so long.
 So don't delay.
 Investigate so as to know clearly and let go, so that the mind will be
 clear and free of suffering and stress, and not forever in disarray.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've been accumulating the words 'us' and 'ours' for countless aeons.
 If the defilements were material objects, what in the world could we take
 for comparison that would be larger than the pile of defilement, craving,
 and mental effluents, the pile of 'us,' the pile of 'ours' we've been accumulat
ing for so long? There's so much of it that it would be beyond our strength
 to drag it out for comparisons.
 If we were to drag it out just to pass the time between eating and sleeping
 — to chip at it, hack at it, poke at it, or slash at it once or twice,
 hoping to break through it — we wouldn't get anywhere at all.
 We'd simply be grabbing at handfuls of water, one after another.
 So we have to give it our all: This is where we will gain our victory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're meditators.
 We can't back away from the fight with the defilements lying within us.
 The word 'defilement' means simply this 'hunk of us.' The defilements are
 'us,' 'ours.' Everything that's 'us' is actually a pile of defilements.
 There's no need to doubt this.
 If we want to separate them out so as to see them piece by piece for what
 they actually are in line with their true nature, we have to separate them
 using persistent effort in the area of mindfulness and discernment as our
 means of investigating and evaluating them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We separate the elements (dhatu), the four elements.
 Everyone in the world knows of the four elements, but if we want our knowledge
 to go straight to the heart, it has to come from the practice.
 If we investigate using discernment until we see distinctly, it will penetrate
 the heart of its own accord.
 Once it has reached the heart, you don't have to say anything: The heart
 will let go of its own accord.
 Once the knowledge goes straight to the heart, relinquishment comes straight
 from the heart.
 For us to know straight to the heart and let go straight from the heart,
 we have to investigate over and over, again and again, until we understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't assume that, 'This we've already investigated, that we've already
 investigated,' by setting up expectations, counting the times without seeing
 deeply enough to the level of letting go.
 The work isn't done with.
 It really has to reach the level of 'done with,' felt deeply within the
 heart, which then lets go.
 If it's really done with, there's no need to investigate again, because
 the heart has understood and can let go completely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elements are already elements.
 Cognizance is an element.
 The things that make contact are also elements.
 Sights are elements, sounds are elements, all these things are already
 elements.
 As for the khandhas within us, the body (rupa) is a khandha, feelings (vedana)
 are a khandha, labels (sañña) are a khandha, thought-formations (sankhara)
 are a khandha, cognizance (viññana) is a khandha.
 They're groups, aggregates, heaps, bits, pieces, all by their very nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the mind, know that it's the 'knower' we have to test and comprehend
 in the same way as the elements and khandhas so that we won't grab hold
 of it as the self or as belonging to the self, which would simply be creating
 a heavier burden.
 We must investigate it with discernment so as to see it for what it truly
 is, in just the same way.
 But as I've explained the investigation of the mind in a number of talks
 already, you should have a fair understanding of the matter by now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, when a pain arises in the body, we should know distinctly
 that, 'This is a feeling.' That's all.
 Don't go labeling or interpreting it, saying that the feeling is us, the
 feeling is ours, or that anything is ours, for that would simply foster
 more and more defilements and bring more and more pain in to smother the
 heart.
 Then when the feeling doesn't vanish, that would cause even more pain in
 the heart, and what could we possibly find to bear it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pains arise in the body.
 They've been arising ever since the day we were born.
 The moment we came from our mother's womb, the pain was excruciating.
 Only by surviving this death did we become human beings.
 If you don't call that pain, what will you call it? Pains have existed
 ever since way back when.
 You can't force them to change their ways.
 The way of pain in the body is that it continually has to show itself.
 Once it arises, it remains and then vanishes.
 That's all there is to it — arises, remains, vanishes — regardless of whether
 it's an external feeling or an internal feeling, namely a feeling or mood
 in the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, feelings in the body: Investigate them so as to see them
 clearly.
 The body is the body.
 We've seen it clearly, known it clearly ever since the day we were born.
 We can conjure it into anything — us, ours, a prince, a king, nobility,
 whatever, however we want to conjure it — but its truth is simply a truth,
 fixed and unalterable.
 It doesn't change in line with what we conjure it up to be.
 The body is simply the physical khandha.
 It has four elements — earth, water, wind, and fire — gathered together
 and called a person, a woman, a man, classified in endless ways, given
 this name and that, but what stays the same is the body: the 'physical
 heap.' All the parts taken together are called the physical heap, which
 is one reality.
 Take out any of the parts, and each of them also has its reality.
 When they're gathered together, the skin is skin, the flesh is flesh, and
 the same holds true for the tendons, bones, and so forth.
 Even though they have names, don't fall for their names.
 See them simply as individual realities, as a physical heap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the heap of feelings, it's not the body.
 The body isn't a feeling, such as pain.
 Feeling is feeling.
 Whether pleasure appears, or pain or a neutral feeling appears, it's simply
 a separate feeling that you can see clearly.
 These two khandhas — the body and feeling — are more prominent than sañña,
 sankhara, and viññana, which arise at intervals and immediately vanish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feelings, however, even though they vanish, have a period in which they
 remain.
 This you can clearly see in the practice.
 When pain arises, focus on it as your target, as the point to investigate.
 Don't see the pain as being yourself, for that would be going against the
 true nature of feelings and the method of investigation, and you won't
 be able to know the truth of the feeling as you should with your discernment.
 When you don't know the truth and persist in assuming the pain to be yourself,
 you'll increase the pain enormously within the mind, because you are going
 against the principles of nature, which are the principles of truth the
 Lord Buddha taught.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He taught us to investigate so as to see pain — in whichever part of the
 body it may arise — simply as a phenomenon that arises, remains, and then
 vanishes in its own due course.
 Don't get entangled in it.
 Don't fashion or conjure it into being this or that, if you don't want
 to be forever burdened with pain, with never a moment to put it down.
 See its truth the moment it arises, remains, and vanishes.
 That's all there is to feeling.
 Ferret it out so as to see it clearly with mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you have focused on a feeling, turn and look at the mind to see if
 the mind and the feeling are one and the same thing.
 Then look at the body and the mind: Are they one and the same? Look at
 them so as to see them clearly.
 While you are investigating, don't send the mind out anywhere else.
 Keep it right at that one spot.
 For example, when investigating, focus on the pain so as to see it distinctly.
 Then turn to look at the mind so as to see this awareness distinctly.
 Are they one and the same? Compare them.
 This awareness and that feeling: Are they the same? Can you make them one
 and the same? And is the body like the mind? Is it like the feeling? Is
 it similar enough to be one and the same?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There! This is the way we're taught to separate things so as to see them
 clearly.
 The body is the body — how can it be like the mind? The mind is a mental
 phenomenon, a nature that knows, but the elements of the body are elements
 that don't know.
 The earth elements doesn't know, the water element doesn't know, the wind
 element doesn't know, the fire element doesn't know — but this mental element
 (mano-dhatu) knows.
 This being the case, how can they be one and the same?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly with the pain: It's an element that doesn't know.
 It's a phenomenon.
 These two unknowing elements are also different: The feeling and the body
 are different sorts of things.
 They aren't one and the same.
 How could you make them one and the same?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In making distinctions while investigating, look so as to see clearly the
 way things actually are.
 There's no need to fear death.
 There is no death to the mind.
 Don't create snares to catch yourself and hurt yourself.
 There is no death; i.e., no death to the mind.
 There is nothing but awareness, pure and simple.
 Death doesn't exist in the mind, which is something 100% unalterable and
 sure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Death is an assumption that has been conjured up for the mind through the
 power of the mind's own delusion.
 The mind has conjured it up to deceive itself.
 So once we've investigated in line with the truth — that the mind is not
 something that dies — what reason will we have to fear death? What is 'death'?
 We know that the elements and khandhas fall apart.
 We human beings, when we've stopped breathing, are called 'dead people.'
 At that moment the 'knower' separates from the elements, so that nothing
 is left but physical elements with no feelings: That's a 'dead person.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But actually the knower doesn't die, so we have to investigate in order
 to see this clearly with discernment.
 We needn't create the issue of death to stab or snare the heart or to obstruct
 the path we are following for the sake of seeing and knowing the truth
 through investigation.
 No matter how great or how little the pain, keep your attention well fixed
 on the affairs of that pain.
 Use the pain as a whetstone for sharpening discernment.
 Separate the pain from the mind.
 Separate the mind from the pain.
 Be able to compare their every aspect.
 Be careful not to let your attention wander while investigating, so that
 you'll be able to see and know the truth while in hand-to-hand combat with
 that particular khandha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, if it should happen that the mind dies as the world supposes — if it
 should die while you're making your investigation — then make sure you
 know what dies first and what dies after.
 When does the feeling vanish? When does the mind vanish? Where does it
 vanish to? Actually the mind by nature is not something that vanishes.
 How can anyone come and make it vanish?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Investigate carefully between the mind and the khandha until the truth is
 absolutely clear to the heart and your doubts vanish.
 This is called training discernment, developing discernment so as to see
 the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No matter how great the pain arising at that moment, it won't have the power
 to affect the mind at all.
 Once we see the mind as the mind, the feeling as feeling — once discernment
 has seen clearly in this way that the khandhas and the mind are real in
 their own separate ways — they won't infringe on one another at all.
 The body is simply the body and stays as it is.
 When the pain appears, the body is still there.
 When the pain vanishes, every part of the body remains, in accordance with
 its own nature.
 If the feeling arises, that's the feeling's business.
 If it remains, that's the feeling's business.
 If it vanishes, that the feeling's business.
 The mind is the one who knows that the pain arises, remains, and vanishes.
 The mind isn't the one who arises, remains, and vanishes like the body
 or the feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have investigated this way until you're adept, then when the chips
 are down, investigate in the same way.
 You needn't fear death, because you're a warrior.
 Fear of death is not the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha.
 The Dhamma is a matter of courage in the face of the truth.
 This is the basic principle of the svakkhata dhamma: the well-taught teaching.
 Follow in the path of this truth.
 If the time comes to die, be ready to die.
 There is no need to fear, because the mind doesn't die — but be sure to
 know clearly what is appearing at that moment.
 For example, the pain: What is it like? Look at it so as to know its truth.
 Once you have seen its truth, then the pain is simply a phenomenon.
 It doesn't have any meaning, good or bad, at all.
 And it doesn't act as anyone's enemy.
 It's simply its own full reality, displaying itself in line with natural
 principles.
 The body is also its own reality, appearing in line with its own principles.
 The mind is a separate phenomenon that constantly knows and doesn't intermingle
 with anything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you have investigated so as to know all-around, the mind extricates
 itself to be its own reality in full measure.
 The pain has its own fullness in line with its nature; the body has its
 own fullness in line with its nature, in that the mind doesn't create any
 turmoil, trying to lay claim to anything of theirs.
 This being the case, nothing disturbs anything else.
 Pain, no matter how great, has no impact on the mind.
 You can smile even while great pain is arising — you can smile! — because
 the mind is something separate, not involving itself with the feeling.
 It doesn't intermingle with the pain so as to burn itself.
 This way, the heart is at ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, then, is the investigation of pain so as to comprehend it, by taking
 pain as your battlefield, as a whetstone for discernment, as the place
 where you temper and sharpen discernment by investigating and dissecting
 the pains that arise.
 Single out the body and single out the feeling.
 Which will vanish first, which will vanish after, try to know in accordance
 with their truth.
 Arising and vanishing have always been a part of their nature from time
 immemorial.
 Regardless of whether or not you've been aware of it, these have been their
 inherent characteristics.
 All you need to do is to investigate so as to see in line with their truth,
 so as not to resist the Dhamma, and you can live at ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 If the time comes to die, let the body die — as the conventions of the
 world understand 'dying.' The body falls apart, so let it fall apart.
 Whatever is going to disintegrate, let it go — but that which doesn't disintegr
ate remains.
 That which doesn't disintegrate is this mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mind, once it has developed discernment as a standard within itself,
 is really like this, with no flinching in the face of illness or death.
 The mind is courageous and capable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There, then.
 This is how we investigate our affairs — the affairs of the mind.
 We needn't fear death.
 Why fear it? The Buddha taught us not to fear.
 The Dhamma doesn't teach us to fear.
 The truth is nothing frightening, because it's the truth.
 What's frightening or emboldening about it? Courage? There's nothing that
 calls for courage.
 Fear? There's nothing that calls for fear.
 Here I'm talking about the level where we have reached pure truth.
 There's no trace of the words 'courage' or 'fear' left in the heart at
 all.
 There's only purity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But while investigating so as to reach the truth, we need to have courage.
 When we are going to seize victory for ourselves, we can't not have courage.
 Otherwise we'll lose.
 This is because we're following the path.
 We need courage and daring, with no fear or intimidation in the face of
 anything at all.
 Whatever comes our way, we must investigate so as to know and understand
 it, without growing discouraged or weak, so as to be intent on knowing
 and seeing it in line with its truth — everything of every sort that comes
 into the range of our awareness.
 This is called being a warrior in the combat between the mind and khandhas,
 or between the Dhamma and the defilements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Courage of this sort is proper and right.
 Once we've reached the goal, fear disappears, courage disappears, because
 we have gained full victory.
 Fear and courage are no longer an issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But right now fear and courage are a critical issue for those still on the
 way.
 Develop courage with discretion in the areas that call for courage.
 Be a fighter with the things that call for fight — such as feelings of
 pain — so as to see in line with their truth.
 Don't be afraid.
 The Buddha taught us not to fear.
 Fear has the same value as death.
 When the time comes, things have to fall apart.
 That's what's called 'death.' But in any event, meditators have to come
 to know with discernment before these things undergo their transformation.
 Spread a net of discernment around yourself on all sides.
 Whatever appears will be caught in the net of discernment, so what is there
 to fear? What is there to be anxious about? What is there to knock you
 off balance? Everything simply follows its truth, which you have already
 investigated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how 'warriors' investigate.
 Even though they're in the midst of khandhas that are a solid mass of flame,
 they're calm and at ease, with the normalcy of a mind that has completely
 comprehended, without being deluded by any phenomenon.
 This is what's meant by one who 'knows all around.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever the symptoms displayed by the body, if they are endurable, we endure
 them.
 We care for the body, look after it, nourish it, make it eat, make it sleep,
 make it drink, take care of it in accordance with its nature.
 If its symptoms are unendurable and it's simply going to go, then just
 let it go in accordance with the ways of nature.
 It's a truth, so how can you thwart it? Let it go in line with the truth.
 This is called letting go with knowledge that accords with the truth.
 The mind feels no attachment, no regrets.
 This is the basic principle of practice for one who has attained, or is
 about to attain, victory within the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previously, the mind has always lost out to defilement and craving.
 It has never, until now, defeated them.
 For aeons and aeons it has lived entirely under the sway of the defilements
 to the point where it has forgotten to realize that 'The defilements are
 the boss.
 We're their servant.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But now we're going to turn over a new us, using the principles of the Dhamma
 as means to subjugate the defilements and mental effluents that have been
 subjugating us, or that have been the ruling elite, the big bosses of the
 cycle of rebirth, forcing the mind to go here and there for so long.
 Now we're going to set our hearts on contending with the defilements for
 victory so as to see the truth of everything of every sort, with nothing
 to obscure our discernment at all.
 At the same time, we will take victory for our own — after having been
 defeated for so long — using the power of unflagging mindfulness, discernment,
 conviction, and perseverance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who have reached the realm of excellence through perseverance have
 a dignity that outshines that of others.
 At the same time, they can take pride in their own perseverance.
 Those who have reached the realm of excellence through gaining victory
 over themselves, and no one else, are supreme within themselves, with no
 creation of animosity — unlike victory in war, with which the world creates
 endless animosities, like links in a chain.
 To gain victory over oneself, though, is to gain the foremost victory.
 As the Dhamma says,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
atta have jitam seyyo:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'It is better to gain victory over oneself.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The things that have created turmoil for the heart, causing it suffering
 and stress in the past, now come to an absolute stop.
 In what I have been saying, don't forget that perseverance is the important
 factor, the factor that supports mindfulness and discernment as the trailblazer
s for the sake of progress in our work.
 Discernment is very important for investigating and exploring so as to
 see causes and effects.
 Mindfulness supervises the work, to keep our attention from straying.
 When discernment has investigated so as to see the truth of such things
 as the five khandhas, the defilements will have no place to hide and so
 will come pouring together into one place — into the heart.
 They have no other place to hold onto, no other place to attach themselves,
 because all such places have been obliterated by discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next stage is to lay siege to the heart, where the enemies lie gathered,
 so as to disperse them from it until nothing is left.
 There! That's called the death of the defilements.
 They die right there, right there in the heart where they've always been.
 They've lived there; and when they die, they die there through the power
 of the most up-to-the-minute 'super-mindfulness' and 'super-discernment.'
 This is called full victory.
 The supreme victory is won right here.
 The teachings of the religion all converge at this point.
 The final stage in their practice comes to an end right here.
 We finish our task right here.
 When we reach the realm of release from suffering and stress, we reach
 it right here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from this, there is nothing: no time, no place, no future, no past.
 As for the present, we are wise to everything of every sort.
 We have no more issues, no more disputes.
 There are no more cases in court between defilement and the mind.
 Super-mindfulness and super-discernment have sat on the bench and handed
 down a death sentence for defilement and all its tribe.
 There is nothing left to carry on the lineage of birth and being.
 At that moment, defilement and all its tribe sink out of sight.
 This is called reaching nibbana: a heart truly constant and sure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the various conditions that used to deceive the mind no longer exist.
 All that remains is pure awareness.
 Even though the khandhas — rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana —
 may form in accordance with their nature, they simply go their own way,
 which has no meaning in terms of defilement at all.
 The body behaves in its 'body way.' Feelings — pleasure, pain, neither pleasure
 nor pain, which appear in the body — behave in the way of feelings.
 Sañña — labels, acts of recognition — behave in their own way.
 Sankhara — the various thought-formations — behave in line with their own
 nature.
 Viññana — acts of noticing when external objects come into contact with
 the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind — notice and vanish, notice
 and vanish, in line with their nature, without being able to provoke the
 mind as before, because the things that cause provocation have all been
 destroyed without leaving a trace.
 These are thus called 'khandhas pure and simple.' The mind has reached nibbana
 in the midst of khandhas pure and simple.
 This is to reach living nibbana: the mind purified of defilement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who have reached this point, you know, don't ask where nibbana is.
 And why should they? What is nibbana, actually? The word nibbana is a name.
 The nature we call nibbana is the actual thing.
 When you reach the actual thing, why ask the name? Why ask for traces and
 signs? What is there left to grope for? Those who really know don't grope,
 aren't hungry, don't lack — because they have reached 'enough,' completely,
 of everything of every sort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 That should be enough explanation for now.
 I ask that we as meditators take this and contemplate it so as to see the
 truth I have mentioned.
 We will then be complete in our hearts, as I have described, without a
 doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'll ask to stop here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Principle of the Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To practice is to search for principles leading to the truth.
 To study is like studying a plan — although people for the most part don't
 follow the plan — but outer plans and inner plans are worlds apart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With outer plans — like blueprints of a house or a building, or maps that
 tell where roads and places are located — the builder examines the blueprint
 and follows it; the traveler follows the routes that appear on the map,
 but if he gets a map that's out-of-date, there are bound to be things that
 have come into being or been torn down that don't show on the map.
 This can cause him to misunderstand and to follow the wrong route.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inner plans, though — such as the 32 parts of the body, the elements, and
 the khandhas, which the Buddha taught us to study and to put into practice
 so as to derive benefits from them — are fixed truths, unchanged from the
 Buddha's time to the present.
 But with these plans within the mind, we can't act like a builder who follows
 the blueprint in his hands, because that would go against the principle
 of the present, which is where the Dhamma arises.
 For example, when we study and understand in line with the texts and then
 practice, it's hard not to speculate in reference to the texts; and so
 when we practice or try to develop concentration in the mind, we'll find
 that the mind has trouble growing still, because of the disturbance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, while practicing the Dhamma, we contemplate or reflect on whatever Dhamma
 we have studied, it's bound to get all confused, because the mind's state
 is not such that these things can be contemplated, pondered, or compared
 with the mind at the moment it's gathering itself together to gain strength.
 This is why we shouldn't bring anything in to disturb it at all.
 Let there simply be the 'Dhamma theme,' the meditation theme we bring in
 to supervise the mind, as if we were charging the mind so as to give it
 inner strength — in other words, so as to make it still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind is still, it gains inner strength.
 Regardless of how much or how little knowledge it has, no trouble or confusion
 results, because the mind has its footing.
 It's secure.
 Calm.
 Peaceful within itself — all because of the stillness, which is a gathering
 of energy.
 This isn't in the plan at all — because while we are practicing, we aren't
 concerned with the texts.
 We're intent solely on developing concentration in the present until we
 gain results — peace, well-being, and various other satisfactory states
 — there in that moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this is in the plan, it's in the part that says, 'Try to make the mind
 stay with just a single Dhamma theme — its meditation word.' Don't get involved
 with other topics at that moment.
 If you let it think of the texts while practicing concentration, it won't
 be willing to stick just with that practice.
 A great deal of extraneous knowledge will interfere, disrupting the mind
 until everything is a turmoil, and no stillness will result.
 This is called going against the plan taught by the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever plans we've been given, however many, however much Dhamma the Buddha
 taught, we gather it all to our own confusion.
 It's as if we were building a hut and yet went around to gather up plans
 for hundred-story buildings and spread them out for a look.
 They just don't go together.
 The plan for a building and the plan for a hut are as different as earth
 and sky, and yet here we are going to gather the mind into one point, which
 is like building a hut.
 Only after we have the strength can we then begin enlarging it into a building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we ultimately reach the level where we are ready to investigate, there
 are no limits as to how broad or restricted it should be.
 The mind can investigate everything throughout the cosmos.
 When we reach the level where we should investigate, that's the level where
 we'll gain firm confirmation in the mind.
 We'll gain knowledge and all kinds of insights from our own investigation.
 This is where the fun lies — sifting, choosing with our discernment what
 is right and what is wrong.
 We'll go back, exploring through the Dhamma we have already studied and
 compare it with the causes and results in our practice until they agree,
 and then we can set the matter to rest.
 Even though we may have already understood clearly, we still have to gain
 confirmation to give it further support, for the sake of full conviction
 and certainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is what's meant by discernment.
 It's not the case that if we have no doubts then there's no reason to make
 comparisons.
 The Dhamma of the doctrine is one thing, the Dhamma of the practice is
 another.
 We take the Buddha's wealth and compare it with our own wealth, gained
 from our practice.
 If they match, we can accept the matter and put it aside, with no more
 concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, when we practice in line with the four Noble Truths or the
 four foundations of mindfulness (satipatthana), these are things that the
 Buddha described as being interconnected.
 If we practice them one by one, in line with the texts — investigating
 the body, and then feeling, and then the mind, and then mental events —
 we'll be wrong the livelong day, because these things by their nature are
 interconnected at all times.
 We can investigate whichever aspect we want.
 Whichever aspect feels most natural to us, we should start with that one
 first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By and large, we start out by investigating the body.
 But when a pain appears, we have to let go of the body and focus on the
 pain.
 We then consider the pain in relation to the body, distinguishing between
 the two so that we understand them clearly.
 Then we distinguish between the pain in the body and the pain in the mind,
 comparing them and distinguishing between them again.
 Body, feeling, mind, and mental events lie together in the same moment.
 So we separate out the body — in other words, investigate it — and then
 separate out the feeling so as to know whether or not the body and feeling
 are one and the same.
 Then we separate the mind from the mental events within the mind, so as
 to see that each of these events is not the same thing as the mind.
 To say just this much covers all four of the foundations of mindfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can't divide these things and deal with them one at a time, one after
 another, the way we take one step after another while walking.
 To do so is wrong.
 This is the way it is with the practice: When we investigate one aspect
 or another of the four foundations of mindfulness or the four Noble Truths,
 they all become involved of their own accord — because they are interconnected
 phenomena.
 The Buddha says, for example,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
kaye kayanupassa viharati: 'Investigate the body within the body.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, the phrase, 'the body within the body' means to start out with any
 one of the many parts of the body.
 Once we have contemplated that part until we gain an understanding, our
 investigation then permeates further of its own accord, making us curious
 about this part and that.
 This keeps spreading and spreading until it reaches everything in the body.
 In other words, it covers everything and understands everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'The body within the body' — for example, kesa, hair of the head: Even though
 we may contemplate only one hair on the head, it has an impact on our understan
ding of how may hairs on the head? And then connects up with how many parts
 of the body? It affects everything.
 It permeates everything, because everything is interrelated.
 No matter what we investigate, this is the way it goes, in line with the
 principles of investigation in the area of the practice that the Noble
 Ones have followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Feeling': It arises in our body.
 Focus on whichever one point is very pronounced.
 Investigate it — whichever point is more painful than the rest.
 When we focus on that as a starting point, our investigation will spread
 to all other feelings because no matter where they arise, they all become
 involved with the one mind.
 As soon as we investigate a feeling, the mind and the feeling immediately
 fly toward each other, and then we separate them out, because the four
 foundations of mindfulness — contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and
 mental events — are interrelated in this way.
 'External feelings' refer to physical feelings, feelings of pleasure, pain,
 and neither pleasure nor pain in the various parts of the body.
 'Internal feelings' refer to the feelings of pain, pleasure, and neither
 pleasure nor pain in the heart.
 These are also counted as feelings that occur in the hearts of ordinary
 people everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These three kinds of feelings: Even when we're meditating and the mind enters
 into stillness, it still has a feeling of pleasure.
 But ordinarily, people usually have feelings of pain and discontent within
 the heart.
 If we don't investigate — for example, if we've never practiced the Dhamma
 — these three feelings also exist, but they're worldly feelings, not the
 feelings connected with the Dhamma of those who practice meditation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we practice, and the mind is still and calm, there is a feeling of
 pleasure.
 If the mind doesn't settle down and grow still as we want it to, feelings
 of bodily and mental pain or distress arise.
 Sometimes the mind is vacant, drifting, indifferent, something of the sort.
 You can't call it pleasure or pain.
 It's simply vacant and drifting — something like that — in the mind of
 the meditator.
 This doesn't mean vacant and drifting in the sense of someone completely
 oblivious.
 It's simply a state in the mind.
 This is called a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At present, we aren't yet aware of these things — even now, when they're
 very pronounced.
 We aren't yet aware because we don't yet have the discernment.
 When the mind becomes more refined, then whatever appears, whatever state
 arises, we are bound to know, and to know increasingly, in line with the
 strength of our own mindfulness and discernment.
 Actually, these things are the bosses, lording it over the heart: Okay,
 for once let's call them what they are, because that's what they've actually
 been all along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart is their vessel, their seat.
 That's where they sit.
 Or you could say it's their toilet, because that's where they defecate.
 Whichever one comes along, it gets right up there on the heart.
 Now pain jumps up there and defecates.
 Now pleasure gets up there and defecates.
 Now a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain gets up there and defecates.
 They keep defecating like this, and the heart is content to let them do
 this, because it doesn't have the mindfulness or discernment to shake them
 off and not let them defecate.
 This is why we have to develop a great deal of mindfulness and discernment
 so that we can fight them off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness is crucial.
 It has to keep track constantly, because it's the supervisor of the work.
 No matter where discernment goes scrutinizing, no matter what it thinks
 about, mindfulness sticks right with it.
 Discernment contemplates and mindfulness follows right along with it.
 This is why it doesn't turn into sañña.
 As soon as we let mindfulness lapse, discernment turns into sañña, in accordanc
e with the weakness of the mind just learning how to explore.
 But once we become more proficient in the areas of both mindfulness and
 discernment, the two stick so close together that we can say that there's
 never a moment when the mind's attention lapses — except when we sleep,
 at which time mindfulness and discernment don't have to work, and even
 the defilements take a rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we reach this level, there is never a moment where the mind's attention
 lapses.
 This is thus called super-mindfulness and super-discernment.
 How could it lapse? It stays right with 'what knows ' at all times.
 Mindfulness and discernment exist together in this one mind and have become
 one and the same thing.
 So where could they lapse? Once mindfulness and discernment are continuous,
 we can speak in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before, we were never able to know how much the mind scrambled, stumbled,
 and fell.
 But when we reach the level where these things become one and the same,
 then as soon as there's a rippling in the mind, we are right there up on
 it.
 Instantly.
 Instantly.
 Whatever gets thought, we are progressively more and more up on it.
 And especially if it's a matter of defilement, then mindfulness and discernment
 are extra quick.
 But if the mind is an ordinary mind, it doesn't know.
 Even if defilements climb up and defecate on our head from dawn to dusk
 and from dusk to dawn, we can't be aware of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the area of the practice, we practice on our own and know on our own.
 That's when things become clear.
 Let's see right and wrong clearly within ourselves.
 Let's know things clearly within ourselves.
 Only then can we be certain.
 Once we have practiced and come to know, we can be courageous in what we
 say and courageous within the heart, with no fear that we might be speaking
 wrongly or venturing guesses.
 We are sure of ourselves from having practiced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To strip away the things that bind the heart has to be difficult.
 For those who are weak-willed, it's especially difficult.
 There is no way they can succeed, because they keep creating obstacles
 for themselves whenever they are about to develop goodness or break away
 the binding of unawareness and craving from around the heart.
 To break open the binding of the wheel of rebirth depends mainly on our
 being earnest and intent: That's what will clear our way.
 This is why living beings don't want to touch that binding, don't want
 to break it open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our earnest intent is what will lead us to know exactly how extraordinary
 the things taught by the Buddha really are.
 When we have this kind of earnest intent toward the Dhamma filling the
 heart, then no matter how difficult things become, we won't let that difficulty
 bother us or become an obstacle.
 We want solely to know, to see, to understand.
 We feel motivated solely to think, ponder, and investigate in line with
 the aspects of the Dhamma we want to know and see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has us engrossed day and night — engrossed in our desire to know and
 see, engrossed in the results we obtain step by step, engrossed in probing
 and cutting away the defilements and mental effluents.
 These lie nowhere but in the heart — except when the heart grabs hold of
 external things that are harmful and toxic, and brings them inward to overpower
 itself to no purpose.
 The mind thus has to probe, investigate, remedy, and slash away inside
 itself because these are the things that bind the heart.
 The heart is what makes itself unruly and reckless, roaming about, collecting
 these things to burn itself, because it doesn't have the good sense to
 avoid them or remedy them.
 For this reason, we need to develop a great deal of mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha was always teaching mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
nisamma karanam seyyo:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Use discernment to consider before doing anything,' in order to guard against
 error.
 Both in inner and outer activities, mindfulness and discernment are always
 important.
 But usually when the mind thinks of doing anything, we don't consider it
 first.
 Even if we don't consider things while we think of doing them, we should
 at least consider them when the mind has made contact with one matter or
 another, and trouble arises as a result.
 But usually we don't see the harm of our own recklessness, and this is
 why we never learn.
 So we keep thinking and acting in our old ways repeatedly, and the results
 are thus unceasing stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We shouldn't guess, we shouldn't anticipate what the practice will be like.
 Where is heaven? Don't guess about it.
 Where are the Brahma worlds? Don't waste your time anticipating.
 Where is stress? Its cause? Its cessation? The path? Don't anticipate their
 being anywhere outside the body and mind that are in contact with each
 other and with these various things at all times.
 Focus right here, so as to see the truth in line with the principles of
 the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You'll know what's outside; you'll know what's inside.
 Especially when you know what's inside, that's when you'll gain insight
 into everything that exists, in line with your temperament and abilities,
 without your anticipating it.
 The mind will simply know of its own accord.
 Your basic problem is that you don't yet know yourself inside and simply
 want to know what's outside.
 This will only make you agitated and confused, without serving any purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to gather matters into yourself so as to see the truth, then:
 What is hell? And where is it? If you want to know hell, then go ahead.
 Where is it? Where is the suffering that the defilements dig up, the suffering
 they produce in ascending stages? If it doesn't lie in the body and mind,
 where does it lie? If, when you let yourself fall into hell and the fires
 of hell burn you day and night, you still don't know where hell is, then
 where else are you going to look for it? Bring things inward in this way
 so as to know the truth: the Noble Truths that lie within you.
 Once you know the Noble Truths, you'll understand every pit in hell without
 having to ask anyone.
 Think of how much the Buddha and his Noble Disciples knew about hell —
 and yet who told them about it? How is it that they were able to know and
 see to the point of teaching us into the present?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Heaven' is the enjoyment, the sense of exhilaration in the Dhamma, in the
 goodness and merit that lie within the heart, causing it to be calm and
 at peace.
 This is your 'heavenly treasure.' The Brahma worlds lie with the levels
 of the mind.
 No matter which level of the Brahma worlds you want to reach, they are
 all levels of the mind that indicate on their own that this mental state
 corresponds to this level or that and that have the characteristics of
 those levels.
 For this reason, you have to put 'this one' — the mind — into good shape,
 into proper shape.
 Don't go concerning yourself with anything other than this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every day, every night, we should probe into our own minds, together with
 the things that become involved with them.
 The important factors are the body — this is very important — and the five
 khandhas.
 These things are always making contact because they have been together
 with us since way back when.
 Things outside — sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations
 — sometimes subside, but the five khandhas and the heart are always together
 and always at issue with one another.
 There is no one who can decide these issues and put an end to them unless
 we use mindfulness and discernment as our judges to make a decision that
 will put the case to rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normally, rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana lie right with us,
 with the heart.
 They are interconnected and interrelated to the point where no one can
 untangle the case and pass a verdict, because we don't have the discernment
 to deliberate and decide what verdict to pass.
 So we simply let issues arise all the time: 'That hurts.
 This aches.
 I'm afraid I'll faint.
 I'm afraid I'll die.' We really are afraid — as if by fearing to the utmost,
 straight to the heart, we could somehow escape death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This fear of death: We really fear it and yet we don't know what death is,
 or who dies.
 As long as we haven't investigated down to the 'foundation of death,' we'll
 have to fear it all the livelong day.
 But once we have investigated down to the foundation of death, what is
 there to fear? — because nothing in the world dies.
 There is simply the change, the exchange of the various elements, and that's
 all.
 Change is something we already know.
 The Dhamma has taught us: 'Inconstancy' — things are always changing.
 'Stress' — where is there if not right here? 'Not-self' — this already
 tells us — what is there of any substance, that's 'us' or 'them'? The Dhamma
 tells us with every word, every phrase, and yet we prefer to fly in the
 face of the Dhamma.
 We want that to be us, we want this to be ours.
 This wanting is an affair of defilement: That's not us, it's simply defilement
 from head to toe — or isn't it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it were to become our self as we say it is, wouldn't it be a heap as
 big as a mountain? If every defilement of every sort were to be gathered
 together, who knows how many millions of mountains they'd be? We wouldn't
 be able to carry them at all.
 What we already have is more than we can handle! So we should investigate
 these things to see them clearly and then cut them away, one mountain at
 a time.
 Otherwise we'll be unable to walk, because we'll be full of the mountains
 of every person's every sort of defilement, and of every sort of suffering
 that defilement has created to be borne on top of the heart for such a
 long, long time.
 We should learn our lessons, in line with what the Dhamma has taught us,
 so that we will have some place to put down our burden of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feelings — these characters: These are our enemies.
 All they offer us are feelings of pain or distress arising in the mind
 — sometimes on their own, with no connection to the body.
 The body may be perfectly normal, but because of our preoccupations, feelings
 of pain can manage to arise in the mind.
 If we think of something that stabs at the heart, a feeling of pain or
 distress arises.
 If we think in a way that will extricate us, a feeling of pleasure arises.
 When the mind rests and stays neutral within itself, that's a feeling of
 equanimity.
 See? We can clearly see them like this — if we reflect so as to see them.
 If we aren't observant, if we don't investigate them, we won't see them
 to our dying day.
 We will simply die in vain.
 Don't go thinking that we can gain knowledge and insight, and free ourselves
 of suffering, without making an effort to strive and investigate.
 Many, many living beings have died in failure because of their complacency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In investigating, don't set up any anticipations that you would like to
 have your different feelings disappear.
 That would only be increasing the cause of stress.
 Simply look inside the feeling itself when it arises.
 Use your mindfulness and discernment to contemplate without let-up.
 Investigate until you understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sañña: This is very important.
 Normally, sañña is something very important.
 When pain arises, the pain is important, but pain doesn't arise all the
 time.
 As for sañña, it keeps right on labeling.
 This is very important, very subtle, very delicate and refined.
 It's deceptive, which is why it has us deceived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sankhara is what hands things over to sañña, which elaborates on them to
 the point where they become endless and unstoppable unless we use mindfulness
 and discernment to act as a block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viññana is what takes note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for sañña — labeling and interpreting — it has a big job to do, running
 around stirring up all kinds of trouble throughout the body.
 Sañña is what hoodwinks the heart, making it fall for labels until it can't
 see the harm they wreak in the five khandhas.
 Sañña is the primary culprit.
 Meditation circles are well aware of it, which is why they warn us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind has things like this burying it, obstructing it, and coercing
 it, it can't display even the least little bit of ingenious strategy, because
 they have it overpowered.
 For this reason, we have to force the mind to investigate and unravel its
 various preoccupations so that it can see its way clear.
 Its various labels and interpretations are gradually peeled off or removed,
 step by step.
 Mindfulness and discernment are then freed to think and develop more of
 their own strength.
 When we reach the stage where mindfulness and discernment come out to investiga
te, nothing can stay hidden.
 Mindfulness and discernment will probe into everything, into every nook
 and cranny, understanding continually more and more — engrossed in their
 contemplations and explorations, engrossed in the results that keep appearing
 — because to probe with discernment is a direct way of cutting defilement
 away so that we see results, step by step, without pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concentration is simply a tactic for herding the various defilements into
 one focal point so that we can rectify or destroy them more easily.
 To put it simply, concentration is strength for discernment.
 When the mind gathers in the levels of concentration, it is content to
 work from various angles in the area of mindfulness and discernment.
 When it's working, the results of its work appear.
 The defilements fall away one after another.
 The heart becomes engrossed in the results of its work and investigates
 even more, never having its fill, like spring water flowing continually
 throughout the rainy season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So focus right here.
 Don't go anywhere else.
 The Noble Truths are right here in the body and heart.
 Ultimately, they come down solely to the heart.
 Probe down into the heart.
 How is it that we don't know? Where did the Buddha know? He knew right
 here in the area of these four Noble Truths.
 He knew in the area of these four foundations of mindfulness, which lie
 in the bodies and hearts of us all.
 The Buddha knew right here and he taught right here.
 So investigate to see clearly right here.
 Defilement, the paths, the fruitions, and nibbana lie right here.
 Don't imagine them to be anywhere else.
 You'll simply be pouncing on shadows outside of yourself and grasping fistfuls
 of water, without ever meeting with the real Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In focusing your investigation when a feeling arises in the mind — as for
 feelings in the body, we've discussed them at great length already — when
 a feeling of stress or pain, such as a mood of distress, arises within
 the mind, focus on that feeling of distress.
 Take that feeling of distress as the target of your watchfulness and investigat
ion.
 Keep alert to it.
 Don't set up any desires for it to vanish once it has appeared in the mind.
 Make yourself aware that the feeling of distress arising in the mind has
 to have a cause.
 It can't just come floating in without a cause.
 If you don't know its cause, focus on the result — the distress itself
 — as the heart's preoccupation.
 Keep aware right at the heart.
 Focus on contemplating and unraveling the feeling of distress right there.
 Don't let go of that feeling to go looking or investigating elsewhere.
 Otherwise you will make the mind waver, without ever being able to establish
 a foothold and it will become shiftless and irresolute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However long that distress will have to last, keep looking at it to see
 if it's really constant, solid, and lasting.
 Your mind is something more lasting than the feeling, so why won't it be
 able to investigate it? The feeling arises only for a period and then vanishes
 when its time is up, when it no longer has any supporting conditions.
 Since the mind by its nature is something that knows, then even though
 a feeling of distress arises, it still knows.
 Whether there is a little distress or a lot, it knows — so why won't it
 be able to investigate the distress? It has to endure the distress, because
 the mind is already a fighter and an endurer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 However great or little the distress, fix your attention on that spot.
 Don't set up any desires for it to disappear.
 Simply know the truth of the feeling as it arises and changes.
 Know right there and know its every phase, heavy or light, great or little,
 until it finally disappears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the feeling of distress dissolves away from the heart through your
 focused investigation, know what feeling arises in its place.
 Keep knowing step by step.
 Only then can you be called an investigator.
 Don't hold fast to any feelings — whether of pleasure or of equanimity.
 Know that they too are feelings and are individual conditions, separate
 from the mind — and so they can change.
 This one comes in, that one dissolves away, this one takes its place: They
 keep at it like this, in line with the common nature of feelings, because
 the seeds are constantly in the heart, enabling these three kinds of feelings
 to appear.
 Once the mind has absolutely no more seeds of any sort, no feelings or
 moods of any sort will appear in the mind at all, aside from 'paramam sukham'
 — the ultimate ease that's part of the nature of a pure heart.
 This doesn't count as a feeling.
 When the Buddha says, 'nibbanam paramam sukham' — nibbana is the ultimate
 ease — that's not a feeling of ease, stress, or equanimity, and so it's
 not subject to arising and disappearing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When focusing your investigation on all three of these feelings, take the
 feelings themselves as your battleground.
 Focus on watching them carefully and in full detail.
 Keep watching each one as long as it hasn't yet disappeared.
 Watch it again.
 Keep watching until you know its truth.
 Whether or not it disappears isn't important.
 What's important is that you know the truth of this feeling — the one appearing
 in the present.
 This is called contemplating feeling as a foundation of mindfulness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually this refers to feelings of distress or pain, because these are the
 ones that are most striking and unsettling to the heart.
 As for feelings of pleasure, they're a way-station for the mind.
 You could say that they help us, or that they are the results that come
 from investigating feelings of distress until the distress disappears and
 pleasure appears.
 This is one of the results that comes from investigating feelings of distress
 or pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for whether or not we should do away with feelings of pleasure, as far
 as I've noticed I've never seen them being eliminated.
 Feelings of pain or distress are the important ones within the mind.
 They arise from the seeds of defilement.
 Once these seeds are lessened step by step, the feelings of mental pain
 become more and more refined, more and more refined.
 They gradually fade away until they disappear without leaving a trace in
 the mind, because the seeds are gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When these seeds are gone, that type of pleasurable feeling also disappears.
 It disappears because it relies on those seeds to arise.
 Thus we can say that the feelings of pleasure that arise in the heart from
 practice, or from the basis of the mind — the stillness of the mind, the
 radiance of the mind — qualify as 'vihara-dhamma,' dwelling places for
 the mind, way-stations for the mind on its journey.
 Or we could say that they're the results that come from investigating feelings
 of pain.
 Whether or not we investigate this pleasure is not as important as investigatin
g feelings of pain and their causes — which are very important, because
 they are in a direct sense the origin of stress.
 They give rise to stress as their direct result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of the four Noble Truths, the Buddha teaches us to diagnose
 stress, but why doesn't he teach us to diagnose pleasure? What does pleasure
 come from? He doesn't say — because it arises from the path doing its duty
 until the cause of stress disintegrates and pleasure arises in its stead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now when the stress that's part and parcel of defilement disappears, this
 type of pleasure disappears as well, but another kind of pleasure or ease
 appears along with the heart that has been purified — and this doesn't
 disappear with anything at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now as for concentration: When you're going to make the mind still, you
 really have to make it stay with its theme of tranquillity meditation.
 Don't go concerning yourself with the topics you've been investigating,
 because the mind has to rest.
 You can't not let it rest.
 When the time comes to rest, it needs rest.
 No matter how great the results and accomplishments you get from your practice
 of investigation, the heart can still grow tired and weary.
 Your work — your thinking and pondering in the area of discernment or whatever
 — is all work for the mind.
 When the mind has been thinking, pondering, and investigating for a long
 time, it can grow weary and so it has to rest.
 When the time comes to rest, you shouldn't involve yourself with any work
 at all.
 Set your mind solely on performing your duties for the sake of mental stillness.
 This is called working without overstepping your boundaries; without being
 worried about what went before or will come after; without overflowing
 your banks.
 The heart will then have the strength to continue its work with clear insight
 and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you want stillness of mind so as to provide strength for discernment,
 you should set your mind on the theme that will make the mind still and
 then stick right with it until the mind is still, right then and there.
 Once the mind has been still long enough to gain strength, you can then
 withdraw from that stillness.
 Now you start probing.
 You don't have to concern yourself with stillness.
 Your duty is to investigate step by step.
 This is called the correct way — the appropriate way, the uniform way —
 to follow the path of tranquillity and insight all the way to the goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these are problems I've been through myself.
 When I would get engrossed in something, I'd be so stuck that I'd get addicted
 and heedless.
 I'd get addicted to the stillness, the sense of comfort and ease in concentrati
on.
 When I'd get engrossed in investigating, I'd be so engrossed that I'd forget
 myself and wouldn't let the mind rest at all.
 Neither of these ways is correct.
 In other words, neither is in keeping with what is just right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right way is that when the mind feels tired and weary from its work,
 we have to let it rest in stillness.
 When the time comes to investigate, we have to investigate.
 We can't worry about anything else.
 We have to set our mind on our duties, step by step, in keeping with the
 job at hand.
 This is always the appropriate way to proceed with tranquillity and insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no job in the world bigger than the job of removing defilement,
 of removing oneself from the cycle of wheeling around from birth to death
 for countless lifetimes.
 When we think about it, it's really dismaying — circling around from birth
 to death, carrying a load of nothing but suffering and stress.
 No matter what the level, the only difference is that the stress is less
 or more, because all levels have stress inasmuch as they contain the defilement
s that give rise to stress.
 So how can they not have stress? All living beings have to suffer stress.
 The Buddha thus taught us to rid ourselves of all defilement until there
 is nothing left hidden in the mind.
 Let there simply be the 'pure meat.' Don't let there be any bones, or they'll
 be bad for your health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defilements, no matter what the sort, need to be cleansed away, peeled away
 until nothing is left.
 This is why it's called a very big job.
 There are times when we have to give it our all — all our skill, all our
 mindfulness and discernment, even our life — to an extent that we will
 never forget.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'So.
 If we're going to die, then let's die.
 If not, then let's know it.' That's all there is.
 There can be nothing else.
 This is when the mind is its own mainstay.
 Atta hi attano natho: It can take care of itself.
 In other words, we leave it to the mind's own strength.
 When the mind is whirling in for the sake of the realm beyond suffering,
 as if nibbana were always just coming into reach; while what's behind us
 keeps pressing in, and we realize more and more its danger and harm, there's
 only one way to escape the Great Danger:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'If we're going to die, then let's die.
 If not, then let's know the Dhamma.' Wherever we are, we don't want to stay.
 Wherever we're stuck, we don't want to be stuck.
 It's a waste of our time in gaining release from suffering.
 We've simply got to reach release from suffering.
 This is the only thing that can satisfy such a mind at such times.
 When the mind is this way, where is it going to find any weakness or laziness?
 If things get tough, we fight.
 If they're easy, we fight.
 If we're going to die, we still fight until we have no more breath to breathe
 — and that's when the mind finally stays put.
 It can't possibly be moved.
 Once it knows and reaches the goal, it stays put on its own.
 No matter where you chase it, it won't go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment — which has been spinning itself in circles even more than a
 wheel — when the time comes, stops on its own.
 It simply runs out of duties of its own accord, without our having to turn
 it off, the way we do with motors.
 This automatic mindfulness and discernment simply stops or turns off on
 its own — because it already knows, so what else is there to investigate?
 It has already let go, so what else is there to let go? It already knows,
 so what else is there to know? It has had enough, so where else is it going
 to look for enough? It knows all of this within itself.
 It knows in an instant and is released.
 In other words, it knows for the last time.
 This is where the big job is finished.
 The job is big, and the results are enormous.
 Nothing in any of the three worlds can compare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of this big job, this heavy job, you know, excel the world —
 and how could we say that ultimate ease doesn't excel the world? When excellenc
e stands out, filling the heart, it's far different from defilement standing
 out, filling the heart.
 Whoever wants to know has to practice for him or herself.
 No one else can do it for us.
 When we reach the level of excellence, we excel exclusively within, without
 disturbing anyone else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Dhamma is always timeless (akaliko).
 It has been the guarantor of the paths, fruitions, and nibbana from the
 time of the Buddha to the present.
 No one will ever be able to erase it.
 The Buddha excelled the world because of this Dhamma.
 The arahant disciples whom we revere as our refuge all excelled because
 of this Dhamma of purity — and because of this heavy job.
 When our Teacher has led us to proceed in this way, what business do we
 have shilly-shallying around? We can't act only in line with our preferences,
 because our Teacher didn't lead us in that way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our foremost Teacher was a genius, an utterly genuine person, unequaled
 by anyone.
 But we're a bunch of show-offs, doing only what our Teacher criticized,
 and so we keep meeting only with things worth criticizing.
 Don't we ever think of changing, or do we feel we're being stylish and
 up-to-date?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, the path to cure defilement has to be difficult.
 The path to accumulate defilement is easy — because our preferences fool
 us into thinking it's easy.
 (Notice: They fool us into thinking it's easy.) Actually, both paths are
 hard.
 Whatever the job, the important point is which job we prefer.
 We'll see that job as easy.
 Light.
 Comfortable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first, when we were starting out with the job of curing defilement, we
 weren't getting anywhere at all.
 Even though we were set on curing defilement, the work was heavy and we
 were weak and lazy.
 Everything bad and worthless was gathered right there.
 But now that we gradually come to comprehend causes and effects, and to
 understand the Dhamma, the results have begun to appear.
 Where has our laziness gone? All that's left is diligence and persistence.
 We can contend with anything, heavy or light — we can contend with death
 — because we have begun seeing results.
 Even though we have been curing defilement all along, the difference is
 that at one stage we don't see results, and at another we do — and persistence
 really arises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 If things get heavy, we fight.
 We're disciples of the Tathagata and so we have to follow in our Teacher's
 footsteps.
 Our Teacher met with difficulties, so his disciples will have to meet with
 difficulties.
 Our Teacher passed out two or three times.
 Is there anyone among us who has passed out from the effort of the practice?
 I don't see anyone who has.
 So why are we afraid of dying when we've never even passed out? How can
 we be so stubborn in our fear of death? The Lord Buddha lost consciousness
 three or four times.
 What do we have to say to that? When we lose consciousness, it's because
 we are falling asleep.
 Why aren't we afraid of dying then? So why are we afraid of dying when
 we practice meditation? Exactly what dies?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have explored and seen the truth, we won't fear death — because
 nothing in the world dies.
 All there is, is the mind making its assumptions.
 It deceives itself — 'I'm afraid of dying, I'm afraid of dying' — but when
 it knows the truth of everything of every sort, it's not afraid.
 It's not afraid of death.
 It's not afraid of birth — because it has nothing left to be born.
 So what is there to fear? Why bother with these empty, hollow fears? The
 mind is now released from birth, so why be afraid of birth? There are no
 more seeds for the birth of a body, a man, or a woman.
 There is nothing to fear, nothing to be brave about.
 The mind is even with itself — uniform, unchanging — not 'even' in the
 ordinary sense of 'coming out even.' It's 'even' in the sense of a mind
 that has reached sufficiency: 'even' in its excellence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here I've been talking about a heavy task, but also about the results as
 a means of encouragement, as a means of giving the mind something to hold
 to.
 The results are superlative, in keeping with the difficulties and hardships
 of the practice.
 What do we want in our lives? We all want what is good.
 Even in external things we want what is good, so especially in the area
 of the Dhamma, why shouldn't we want what is good?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then step up your efforts.
 What does it matter if the cemeteries cry because they miss you? You have
 been crying over the cemeteries, so what's wrong with letting the cemeteries
 cry in turn? They have no more hopes now.
 You aren't coming back to be born or die.
 The cemeteries' being without hope is better than your being without hope,
 because there's nothing good about birth and death, circling around, back
 and forth, with nothing but suffering and stress every lifetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So work out solutions — and make them succeed.
 Whatever things are thorns in the heart, use mindfulness and discernment
 to explore, to probe on down and remove them completely so that they're
 all gone.
 Once they're all gone, that's the result of your work.
 We've talked about how hard the work is: What are the results like? Are
 they worth it? Find out for yourself — and then you are free to live wherever
 you like.
 The Buddha says,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
vusitam brahmacariyam:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'The holy life is fulfilled, the task of the religion is done.' This is now
 completely apparent in every way.
 Whatever is stressful is a matter of defilement.
 When the cause — defilement — is ended, the result — stress — is ended
 as well.
 That's all there is.
 From then on there is nothing but ultimate ease, which nothing will ever
 again come to disturb throughout eternity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the End of One's Rope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wherever there's the religion, it's cool and peaceful.
 Wherever a person practicing the religion is lacking, it's hot and troubled.
 If there's no religion, the heart is as hot as fire.
 Whenever there's the religion — mindfulness and discernment — investigating,
 looking after the heart, the heart is cool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we first begin suppressing the rebels in the heart, we suffer — because
 for the most part we're defeated by them — but at least we still have the
 strength to fight with them.
 Even though we may lose out to them sometimes, it's better than groveling
 before them in abject surrender with no way of putting up a fight at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practice in the area of the mind falls into stages — and there are bound
 to be stages where it's complicated and difficult.
 Especially at the beginning: It's difficult in that we can't see beginnings
 or ends, causes or effects.
 We don't understand anything at all.
 When we take the rudiments of Dhamma we have gained from the texts or our
 teachers and put them into practice, sometimes right, sometimes wrong,
 this is when it's very difficult.
 The desire to know and see is very strong, but the heart isn't willing
 to comply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one kind of anxiety I've been through myself.
 It overflowed the heart.
 To put it simply, it was as if the desire to see and know the Dhamma in
 the heart was ready to overflow its banks.
 But when practicing, the heart didn't comply with the desire to know and
 see — and that had me upset and disappointed.
 Sometimes I'd be sitting and the tears would flow because of my self-recriminat
ions: 'You don't have any potential to speak of.
 You've ordained simply to be a dead weight on the religion.
 Here you are sitting in meditation and can't find a way in or a way out.
 You're just sitting buried in a heap of suffering.' The mind would think
 in all sorts of ways out of self-pity — that I was a hopeless case, that
 I didn't have any potential to speak of, didn't have the potential for
 the extraordinary levels of Dhamma, didn't have any potential at all —
 total confusion!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, my practice wasn't yet right.
 I was aiming at the results — the income — without paying attention to
 whether I was doing the work right or wrong.
 The desire was strong, but when it wasn't fulfilled, it caused suffering.
 Had I paid some attention to whether my practice was right or wrong, I
 might have come to my senses enough to have evaluated things, to have abandoned
 some of my bullheaded attachments, or to have cut back on my desires so
 that the suffering would have become lighter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But whenever I'd meditate, whatever I'd focus on, all I wanted was to know
 and see the paths, the fruitions, and nibbana in line with what I imagined
 them to be — heaven was like this, the Brahma worlds were like that, nibbana
 was like this.
 I'd imagine.
 Speculate.
 The desire was fierce.
 I wanted to know, to see, to gain release from suffering, but my practice
 wasn't making any headway.
 All there was, was simple desire: I would simply sit wanting, lie down
 wanting, walk wanting, stand wanting.
 I'd sit in meditation — wanting — but the mind wasn't working at its meditation.
 It just wanted.
 I'd be doing walking meditation, but the mind simply wanted — so much so
 that I'd forget what I was doing.
 I wasn't getting any results because there weren't enough of the causes
 that would bring about the things I aimed for, so how could I have reached
 the goal I aimed for? This is something I've been through.
 The work of meditation struck me as being more difficult than any other
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd be meditating, 'buddho, buddho, buddho,' but the desire would always
 be getting in the way — because I wanted to know, I wanted the mind to
 be like this or that, and so I'd get engrossed in my desires and forget
 my work of meditation until I didn't know where 'buddho' had gone.
 As a result, I didn't get anywhere at all.
 I was constantly feeling dreary and disappointed.
 This is the way things always were in the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But even so, this wasn't anything compared to the stage at which the mind
 regressed.
 When the mind regresses, it's really upsetting because you used to see
 results.
 You used to gain a sense of ease, mental stillness, and peace appearing
 clearly as a solid foundation in the heart, but now it's deteriorated.
 This makes the heart really agitated — so much so that there is nothing
 to hold it in check.
 Luckily, though, in spite of my agitation, I didn't retreat.
 I was simply determined to see things through.
 I wasn't willing to retreat or to slacken my efforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason why the mind regressed and couldn't make a comeback was the same
 sort of thing: desire, nothing mysterious.
 The mind wanted to know and see as it had before, but its work wasn't coordinat
ed or continuous.
 All there was, was desire.
 No matter how much you desire, it doesn't give any results, because that
 would go against the principle of causality.
 If you don't make the causes as complete as they should be, how can you
 expect to know as you want? You can't.
 Sitting, I'd be agitated.
 Lying down, I'd be agitated.
 I'd go into the forest, into the mountains, when the mind had regressed,
 and nothing was any good at all.
 I couldn't figure it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the anxieties I've felt in my life as a monk, the anxiety I felt during
 that period was the worst.
 I was agitated because of my desire to attain.
 I was upset because the mind had regressed and nothing I could do would
 bring it back.
 At first it had regressed just a little bit and then it kept regressing,
 regressing until it was all gone.
 Nothing was left, not one red cent.
 It was as if I had never meditated at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I'd sit in this state, I was as agitated as if I were on fire — because
 of the desire.
 The disappointment that my attainments had floated away and disappeared,
 plus the desire to get them back: These two things came thronging in at
 the same time and so were really strong.
 Wherever I stayed was unsatisfactory and no help at all.
 Even though I was suffering, I would simply keep suffering.
 I didn't know any way out.
 Even though I wanted, I would simply keep wanting.
 I didn't know how to get my concentration back.
 All there was, was desire — regret for the things that had once appeared
 to my surprise and amazement but now were gone.
 There was nothing but disappointment filling the heart, nothing but simple
 desire, and it couldn't bring back the Dhamma that had disappeared.
 Finally I came to feel despair — for everything.
 This was when the mind gave up on its desire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the results I had wanted, well, I had wanted them for a long time.
 As for the suffering, I had suffered immensely because of the desires,
 but hadn't gained anything from them.
 So now I wouldn't have anything to do with them.
 I'd throw them all out.
 If I was going to know, I'd know.
 If not, so be it.
 All I was after was 'buddho.' Whatever the mind was going to think, I wouldn't
 be willing to let mindfulness lapse.
 'Get with it, then.
 Can it really be that I'm not going to know? Whatever's going to happen,
 I'm ready for it.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as I gave up on my desires, they were no longer so fierce, and so
 the suffering gradually lessened.
 I set my mind on my work.
 Wherever I was, I'd keep repeating, 'buddho, buddho, buddho.' It had always
 been a trait with me to be earnest: Whatever I'd do, I would really do
 it and wouldn't just play around.
 Now I got to see this trait in action.
 I didn't let up in my repetition of 'buddho.' Whether walking or doing my
 chores, I wouldn't be willing to let it lapse.
 I'd keep making the effort.
 While sweeping the monastery compound, I would try to keep up my guard
 — until the mind let its work lapse for a moment.
 I was alert to the fact, and the mind got right back to work.
 'There.
 Now that's the way it should be.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After giving up its desires, the mind was no longer involved with the past.
 It stayed in the circle of the present and would do nothing but repeat
 or meditate on 'buddho.' Whether or not it would get any results would depend
 on what 'buddho' would grant.
 Finally the mind became still, and 'buddho' was no longer necessary, so
 I could let go of the meditation word at that moment — and at that point
 the mind was willing to settle down.
 Before, it hadn't been willing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind had settled down in stillness, there was no need to repeat
 the word 'buddho.' All that remained was simple awareness — clear and conspicuou
s — so the mind stayed with that simple awareness.
 As soon as it withdrew, I would start pumping 'buddho' back in.
 I had no hopes, because I had already hoped in the past.
 I had no hopes for what would happen, no hopes for what the results would
 be.
 I had already hoped in the past, and it hadn't given me any decent results
 at all.
 I had seen the harm of hopes — the sort of hollow, unreasonable hopes that
 won't do the work and look only for the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, now I was going to do nothing but work, nothing but work: repeating
 'buddho' without letting up even for a moment.
 Once the mind had received proper nourishment and care, it became still
 — gradually more and more still, more and more steady, until it reached
 the level it had been before it had visibly regressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What was strange was that when it reached its old level, I still abandoned
 my hopes.
 'If it's going to regress, let it regress.
 I've had enough of trying to resist it by using desire, which hasn't served
 any purpose, not the least little bit.
 So, however the mind is going to regress, let it regress, but I won't abandon
 "buddho." I'm always going to keep at it.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it reached the day when it would normally regress, it didn't regress!
 That made me a lot more sure of the causes.
 So I stepped up the causes — the repetition of 'buddho' — even more, without
 stopping.
 I would stop only when the mind gathered in stillness.
 The mind became progressively more and more firm.
 Wherever I'd sit, it would be bright.
 Light.
 Completely clear.
 I was sure of myself: 'Now it's not going to regress.' After one day, two
 days, one month, two months, it still didn't regress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before, the mind would regress after two or three days.
 After two or three days it would come down with a crash, with nothing left
 to show for itself.
 I'd have to keep trying to care for it for 14 or 15 days before it would
 reach its old level, and once it got there it would stay just a day or
 two and then collapse in a flash, with nothing left at all.
 All that was left was dreariness and disappointment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now: 'If it's going to regress, let it regress.
 I've hoped in the past, and it hasn't served any purpose.
 All I'm after is this, just this one thing: "buddho."'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Speaking of the suffering when the mind regresses, you really feel a lot
 of anguish, so much so that you're ready to surrender.
 But I was lucky in one way, that the mind didn't retreat.
 It was determined to see things through, which was why I was able to bear
 with it, able to stay.
 Had the mind become discouraged — 'It'd be better to stop' — that would
 have been the end of me.
 There would have been nothing more to tell.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From then on, the mind kept progressing.
 Month after month, it became more and more stable, more and more firm.
 As for my meditation word, I wasn't willing to let up on it.
 This kept up until the mind was always prominent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was when I let the meditation word go.
 In other words, the awareness of the mind was pronounced, and that was
 enough for the mind to depend on, so there was no need to rely on any meditatio
n word for further support.
 The mind fully knew itself and could sustain itself.
 At this point I didn't have to repeat any meditation word because the mind
 was prominent at all times.
 I would focus right there.
 Wherever I went, I focused right there.
 I knew right there, just as I had focused on 'buddho.' It could form a fine
 foundation for the mind.
 I was sure of myself that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) This foundation had become progressively more and more stable until
 it was more stable than it had been the first time it had progressed and
 then regressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) As for focusing on awareness, when awareness was fully pronounced, I
 should focus on that without let-up, in the same way I had focused on repeating
 'buddho' until the mind became more and more refined.
 This was a foundation for the mind on which I could depend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From that point on, I really stepped up my efforts.
 The time I started sitting in meditation all night until dawn came from
 this point.
 I started to sit one night, focusing on in, focusing on in, and at first
 the mind had settled down because it was used to settling down.
 It settled down easily because it 'had a good foundation.' I kept focusing
 on in, and as long as no enormous pains arose, the meditation went quietly.
 But when I withdrew, a number of hours had passed, and a huge pain arose,
 to the point where I almost couldn't bear it.
 The mind that had been quiet was totally overturned.
 Its 'good foundation' had collapsed completely.
 All that was left was pain filling the body — but the mind wasn't agitated.
 Strange!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The body was so pained that it was quivering all over.
 This was the beginning of the hand-to-hand combat in which I was to obtain
 an important approach — when really severe pain arose unexpectedly that
 night.
 I hadn't yet made up my mind to sit until dawn, you know.
 I hadn't made any resolutions or anything at all.
 I was simply sitting in meditation as usual, as usual, but when the pain
 arose in full force: 'Eh? What's going on here? I'll have to tackle this
 feeling so as to see results tonight!' So I made a resolution in that very
 moment: 'Okay, if the time doesn't come to get up, I won't get up.
 I'll fight until the dawn of the new day.
 Tonight for once I'm going to investigate pain so as to understand it clearly
 and distinctly.
 If I don't understand it, then even if I die, let me die.
 Let me find out.
 So dig down!' This is when discernment really began to work in earnest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had never known, never imagined, never dreamed that discernment would
 become so sharp when it was at the end of its rope, when it was really
 cornered with no way out.
 Discernment really started spinning away.
 It went out digging, exploring, fighting, determined not to withdraw its
 troops in retreat.
 When I was at the end of my rope, discernment arose.
 This made me realize, 'We human beings aren't fated to be stupid forever.
 When we're at the end of our rope, we're sure to manage to find a way to
 help ourselves.' So it was then: When I was cornered, overwhelmed by severe
 pain, mindfulness and discernment probed into the pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When pain arises in full force like this, it fills the entire body.
 At first it started in hot flashes along the backs of my hands and feet,
 which wasn't much to speak of, but then when it really flared up into something
 big, the entire body was ablaze.
 All the bones, as they were connected, were fuel feeding the fire in every
 part of the body.
 It was as if the body were going to fall apart right then and there.
 The neck bones were going to come apart.
 Every bone was going to come apart from its connections.
 My head was going to fall off and hit the floor.
 When it's pained, everything is on a par throughout the body.
 You don't know where to hold it back enough so that you can breathe, because
 everywhere there's nothing but a mass of fire — pain in full force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I couldn't find a safe spot in which to place the mind, mindfulness
 and discernment dug down into the pain, searching for the spot where the
 pain was greatest.
 Wherever the pain was greatest, mindfulness and discernment would investigate
 and explore right there by ferreting out the pain so as to see clearly,
 'Where does this feeling come from? Who is pained?' When they asked each
 part of the body, each of them remained in keeping with its nature.
 The skin was skin, the flesh was flesh, the tendons were tendons, and so
 forth.
 They had been that way from the day of birth, but they hadn't been painful
 all along from the day of birth in the same way that they had been flesh
 and skin from the day of birth.
 'The pain has been arising and vanishing at intervals.
 It hasn't been lasting like these parts of the body.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I focused on down.
 'Each part of the body that's a physical form is a reality.
 Whatever is a reality stays that way.
 Right now where is the feeling arising? If we say that all these things
 are painful, why is there one point where it's really severe?' So I separated
 things out.
 At this point, mindfulness and discernment couldn't slip away anywhere
 else.
 They had to run along the areas that hurt, whirling around themselves,
 separating the feeling from the body, observing the body, observing the
 feeling, and observing the mind: These three are the important principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind seemed comfortable.
 No matter how much pain was arising, the mind wasn't writhing or suffering
 or anything.
 But the pain in the body was clearly very strong.
 The nature of pain and of whatever defilements we have is that they join
 together.
 Otherwise the mind won't be troubled or affected by the physical pain that's
 really severe at that moment.
 So discernment kept digging down until the body, the feeling, and the mind
 were all clear, each in line with its individual truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind was what labeled the feeling as being this or that: This I could
 see clearly.
 As soon as this was really clear in this way, the feeling disappeared in
 a flash.
 At that moment, the body was simply the body in line with its reality.
 The feeling was simply a feeling and it disappeared in a flash into the
 mind.
 It didn't go anywhere else.
 As soon as the feeling disappeared into the mind, the mind knew that the
 pain had vanished.
 The pain had vanished as if it had been snapped off and thrown away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the body disappeared from my sense of awareness.
 At that moment, the body didn't exist in my awareness at all.
 All that was left was simple awareness, because there was only one thing
 — awareness — and it was simply aware.
 That's all.
 The mind was so refined that you could hardly describe it.
 It simply knew, because it was extremely delicate and refined within itself.
 The body had completely disappeared.
 Feelings had disappeared.
 No physical feelings were left at all.
 The body sitting right there in meditation had disappeared from my awareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that was left was 'simple knowingness,' without any thoughts being fashioned
 about this or that.
 At that point, the mind wasn't forming any thoughts at all.
 When it doesn't form thoughts, we say that nothing at all makes the slightest
 move.
 The mind is fixed — firmly fixed in its own solitude.
 It's a mind in its simple form, on the level of a mind centered in stillness
 — but mind you, this doesn't mean that there was no unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unawareness had infiltrated right there, because the mind hadn't withdrawn
 from unawareness.
 The mind and unawareness were quiet together because unawareness didn't
 get out to work.
 When discernment has it surrounded, unawareness shrinks in and hides out,
 quiet in the heart, like the sediment in the bottom of a water jar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that point, I began to feel amazed.
 There was no pain left.
 The body had disappeared.
 Only one thing hadn't disappeared: an awareness so refined I couldn't describe
 it.
 It simply appeared there.
 You couldn't say anything else about it.
 The thing that simply appeared there: That was the great marvel at that
 moment.
 There was no motion in the heart, no rippling, nothing of anything at all.
 It stayed fixed and still like that until enough time had elapsed and then
 it moved.
 The mind began to withdraw and rippled — blip — and then was quiet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This rippling happens on its own, you know.
 We can't intend it.
 If we intend it, the mind withdraws.
 What happens is that the mind has had enough, of its own accord.
 When it ripples in a 'blip' like this, it's aware of the fact.
 As soon as the 'blip' appears, it vanishes.
 After a moment it ripples — blip — again, and disappears in the same instant.
 Then the rippling gradually becomes more and more frequent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind withdraws after having fully settled down to its foundation,
 it doesn't withdraw all at once.
 I could clearly see this at that moment.
 The mind rippled slightly: A sankhara formed in a 'blip' and then disappeared
 before it had amounted to anything at all.
 It rippled — blip — and disappeared right then and there.
 After a moment it rippled — blip — again.
 Gradually it became more and more frequent until finally I came back to
 ordinary consciousness, to the ordinary level of the mind.
 I was aware of the body, but the pain was still gone.
 When the mind came back out, there was still no pain.
 It was still quiet until time came for the pain to reappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where I got my standard and my certainty.
 I realized that I had arrived at a basic principle in contending with pain:
 'So this is how it is.
 Pain is actually something separate.
 The body is separate.
 The mind is separate, but because of one thing — delusion — all three converge
 into one, and the whole mind becomes delusion, the whole mind is the one
 deluded.
 Even though pain may simply arise in line with its own nature, if we grab
 hold of it to burn ourselves, it's hot — because our labeling makes it
 hot.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a fair while, the pain returned, so I had to tackle it again, without
 retreating.
 I had to dig on down, exploring again as I had explored before, but this
 time I couldn't use the tactics I had used in investigating and remedying
 the pain the last time around.
 I needed fresh tactics, newly devised by mindfulness and discernment so
 as to keep up with events.
 It was pain just the same, but the tactics simply had to be pertinent to
 the moment.
 I couldn't remedy matters by holding to the old tactics I had used to investiga
te and know in the past.
 They had to be fresh, hot tactics devised in the present to cure the present.
 The mind then settled down firmly in stillness as it had done before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that first night, the mind settled down three times, but I had to go
 through three bouts of hand-to-hand combat.
 After the third time, dawn came — the end of the final showdown using reason
 with real mindfulness and discernment.
 The mind was audacious, exultant, and had no fear of death.
 'However great the pain may be, that's its own ordinary business.
 As long as we don't enter in and load ourselves down with it, pain has
 no significance in the heart.' The mind knew clearly that the body has no
 significance in terms of itself, in terms of the feeling, or in terms of
 us — unless the mind gives it a significance and then gathers in the suffering
 to burn itself.
 There's nothing else that can come in and make the mind suffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Getting up that morning, I felt audacious in an extraordinary way.
 I wanted to tell Venerable Acariya Mun of my knowledge and capabilities.
 This was because I felt daring in a way hard to describe.
 How was it that things could be so marvelous like this in a way I had never
 encountered before? Ever since I had begun meditating, nothing like this
 had ever happened.
 The mind had completely cut off all connection with any objects and had
 gathered within itself with real courage.
 It had gathered by investigating all around itself, which was why it had
 calmed itself inwardly like a thoroughbred.
 When it withdrew, it was still full of courage, with no fear of death at
 all, owing to its conviction that, 'I investigated like this and this when
 pain arose.
 The next time it comes, I won't fear it because it's the same old pain.
 It's pain with the same old face.
 The body is the same old body.
 Discernment is the same old discernment we've used before.' For this reason,
 the heart felt no fear of death — so much so that it felt all sorts of
 things hard to describe.
 To put it in worldly terms, it was like defying someone right to his face,
 with no fear of pain or death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See? When the mind is bold, it's bold all the way.
 Daring all the way.
 It fights without retreating.
 'Okay, I'll take you on.' To put it simply and frankly, that's just how
 it feels.
 When the time comes to die, 'Okay, I'll take you on.' The mind doesn't retreat.
 'When the time comes to die, where will death find any pain for us greater
 than this? There's no such thing.
 The only pain is the pain in the khandhas.
 It can be great or small, but we know it here in the khandhas.
 No matter how much or how heavy the pain may be, it can't outstrip our
 knowledge and capabilities.
 It can't outstrip our mindfulness and discernment.
 Mindfulness and discernment are capable of keeping track of it all, as
 they have already known and removed it in the past.' This is what made me
 feel really bold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the time would come to die, I didn't see that there would be any problem,
 with mindfulness and discernment all around me like this.
 If the time came to die, then let me die.
 Birth and death come in a pair.
 You can't separate death from birth so as not to die, because they are
 equal truths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next time around, I took on the pain again and knew in the same way.
 I kept on knowing in the same way and winning every time.
 Once I had given it all my strength in that way, there was never a day
 in which I'd say, 'Last night I stayed up in meditation all night until
 dawn and didn't get anything out of it.' But any night in which the mind
 had difficulty investigating and settling down, I would come out feeling
 battered all over my body.
 I'd be all stiff and sore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as for getting tactics and strength of mind, I'd get them every time,
 until I no longer had any fear of death at all — and where would I get
 any fear? Death was something ordinary.
 In other words, discernment had analyzed down to 'What dies?' Hair, nails,
 teeth, skin, flesh, bones: They're simply their original element — solidity,
 the earth element.
 Since when did the earth element ever die? When they disintegrate, what
 do they become? If we focus on down, we see that they return to their original
 properties.
 The water element returns to its original property.
 The wind and fire elements simply return to their own original properties.
 Nothing is annihilated.
 The elements have simply come together in a lump, and the mind comes in
 and animates it — this super-deluded one comes in and animates it, that's
 all — and then carries the entire burden: 'This is my self.' It lays its
 claims: 'This is me.
 This is mine.' And so it rakes in every kind of suffering as if contracting
 for the whole mass, using those assumptions simply to burn itself, and
 nothing else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind itself is the culprit.
 The five khandhas aren't the culprits.
 They aren't our enemies or anything.
 They simply have their own reality, but we make assumptions and carry then
 as a burden.
 This is why there's suffering and stress.
 We manufacture it ourselves.
 These things don't manufacture it for us.
 'There is nothing that comes and gives us suffering': This is how the mind
 came to understand things.
 We are the ones who misconstrue things.
 We are the ones who suffer because we misconstrue things.
 This produces suffering to burn and trouble the heart.
 I could clearly see that nothing dies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind doesn't die.
 It becomes more pronounced.
 When we fully investigate the four elements — earth, water, wind, and fire
 — down to their original properties, the mind becomes even more pronounced
 and clear.
 So where is there any death? What dies? None of these conditions die.
 The four elements — earth, water, wind, and fire: They don't die.
 And as for the mind, how can it die? It becomes more aware.
 More pronounced.
 More conspicuous.
 This doesn't die, so why does it fear death? We've been fooled all along,
 fooled for aeons and aeons, for actually nothing dies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, the word 'fooled' doesn't mean that anyone intended to fool us.
 We've been fooled simply because of our own delusion — fooled into fearing
 death.
 Now we see: This is how the world fears death — from not having explored
 down to its truth, from not knowing what dies.
 Because look: Nothing dies.
 Each thing simply has its separate reality.
 I saw this clearly.
 The mind proclaimed itself by its very nature.
 I saw its marvelousness clearly, every time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even when the pain was as hot as fire in the body and seemed ready to reach
 the clouds, it would vanish clear away, with nothing left, due to the power
 of mindfulness and discernment; even the body would vanish from my sense
 of consciousness and wouldn't appear at all.
 When everything disbanded completely as the result of my investigation,
 all that remained was simple awareness, as if floating in mid-space (although
 I didn't make the comparison at the moment).
 It was completely empty, but the awareness knew clearly.
 There was only one thing.
 There was only one strange thing in the world: the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earth, water, wind, and fire made no contact with the heart.
 The heart thus had no sense of earth, water, wind, fire or any part of
 the body.
 All that remained was a solitary awareness, an awareness not involved with
 anything at all — an amazing awareness, coming from having investigated
 things with circumspection and then having withdrawn from them.
 Clear.
 Outstanding.
 Astounding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the mind can be settled down like this — for no matter how many days
 or nights it may last — it has no sense of pain, that the body will fall
 apart, that it hurts here or aches there: no sense of any of this at all.
 And what would give it any sense of this? Time and place don't exist in
 that mental state.
 This called to mind how the Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and arahant disciples
 could enter the cessation of feeling and perception for seven days at a
 time.
 They could enter for as many days as they liked.
 If their minds settled down like this to the extent of not being involved
 with anything at all, leaving just plain awareness without any involvement
 with time or place, then they could sit for aeons if they liked.
 Even if the body couldn't endure, if it were to break apart, it would simply
 do so, without having any impact on this nature at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was when my mind accepted — really believed in — the ability of those
 extraordinary people who enter the cessation of feeling and perception
 for so-and-so many days.
 If their minds reached this level without withdrawing back out to anything
 outside, then for days or months they wouldn't have any perception of anything
 at all.
 Where would there be pain and pleasure in their bodies? There wouldn't
 be any at all.
 They wouldn't have any sense of the body.
 They wouldn't have any awareness of feelings.
 All that would remain would be plain awareness.
 They could sit for aeons, if they liked, as long as the mind was like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This made me believe in the stories of the Pacceka Buddhas who entered the
 cessation of feeling and perception.
 So I took this as a confirmation in my mind.
 Whoever says I'm crazy can go ahead and say so.
 They have mouths; we have ears.
 If we want to listen, we can.
 If we don't, we can keep still.
 We are all free to have our opinions on this matter and that.
 No one has a monopoly on knowing and seeing!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though I didn't sit for a long time, the state of mind that had grown
 still to that extent for a spell of time was enough to serve as confirmation
 of those who entered the cessation of feeling and perception for long periods
 of time, because it had the same characteristics: not involved with anything
 at all.
 The body would simply be a body.
 If it were to fall apart, if it couldn't last — after all, the body is
 inconstant, stressful, and not-self — then it would simply fall apart without
 the mind's being aware.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a level attained through mindfulness and discernment.
 It's a level where discernment fosters concentration.
 The mind reaches the full extent of concentration like this because discernment
 has fully investigated down to causes and effects.
 It then gathers with courage and great refinement.
 Ordinarily, when the mind filled with just the power of concentration focuses
 and settles down, it is simply unmoving and nothing else.
 It isn't as profound and refined as this.
 But the mind stilled through the power of discernment is refined each time.
 Once we have gone through hand-to-hand combat in this way to the point
 where we get results, the mind has to be absolutely quiet, just like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was the basis, or the starting capital, for my courage; the primary
 seed for my firm conviction in the affairs of the mind.
 No matter how much anything else might be annihilated, this knowing nature
 would not be annihilated.
 I could see this clearly.
 I saw it clearly at the point when nothing else was involved in my sense
 of awareness.
 There was simply that single awareness and so it was very pronounced.
 I couldn't really say whether this was on the level of concentration or
 of discernment.
 When the mind actually was that way, that's how it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From that point on I kept at it.
 I kept investigating out in the area of discernment, ranging out widely,
 then circling back in again.
 As soon as I would understand, step by step, the mind would let go and
 circle inward in an ever-narrowing sphere, investigating the khandhas and
 elements, separating the khandhas and elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where it began to be 'samuccheda-pahana' — absolute relinquishment,
 arising from the investigation in the period that followed.
 As long as the investigation hadn't been absolute, it would win out for
 only a period of time, just enough to serve as evidence and proof.
 It still wasn't absolute relinquishment.
 But when discernment came to a really clear understanding while investigating,
 then it pulled out and severed all ties, step by step — severed things
 so that there were no connections left; severed them step by step, leaving
 just plain awareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The body (rupa) was severed from attachment.
 Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana were severed from attachment.
 Or you could say that the 'heart' was severed from 'them.' Things kept being
 severed until only awareness was left — in other words, the mind with unawarene
ss buried inside it.
 So I probed on in, smashed things to bits, slashed them to smithereens
 with up-to-the-minute mindfulness and discernment.
 The mind of unawareness broke apart, and when the mind of unawareness broke
 apart, that was all!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was when I came to know that all of the marvels I have mentioned here
 were simply an affair of unawareness.
 They had simply been a support, a way-station, a seed that had produced
 conviction step by step, but after that — if you were to say they were
 good, they were good; but if you're aiming at the subtle Dhamma, this goodness
 is the goodness of unawareness.
 It's not genuine goodness, not pure goodness.
 It's goodness mixed with evil, with suffering and stress, because stress
 still has a chance to arise.
 We have to keep slashing in, slashing in until everything is smithereens
 in the heart.
 Whatever is a seed of anything counterfeit in the heart, wash it away,
 scrub it away, until nothing is left, and that's all.
 The entire mind that is assumed to be 'this' or 'that' is all gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where the mind reaches absolute purity, where it reaches complete
 freedom from all conventional realities.
 That's really 'all'! It's astounding.
 If it weren't astounding, it wouldn't be release from stress.
 This is a Dhamma apart — a Dhamma beyond conventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether what I've described here is difficult or not, consider it for yourselves.
 Sometimes I'd feel ready to pass out.
 Sometimes I'd feel as if the entire body were on fire.
 When the pain was really fierce, it seemed to fill the entire body.
 But ultimately I was able to pass through these things, to resolve them
 using mindfulness and discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if we put them to use, mindfulness and discernment are never at the end
 of their rope.
 We human beings aren't fated always to be stupid, you know.
 When we come to the end of our rope, we're sure to be able to save ourselves.
 Who should be willing to go under when we have the mindfulness and discernment
 to remedy things, or when there's an opening through which we can escape,
 through which we can force our way out? Who would willingly be buried to
 death? We can't help but manage to find a way out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the pain is so piled on that we can't see any way to cure it other
 than using mindfulness and discernment to explore and find a way out, discernme
nt doesn't depend on this person or that.
 When the time comes for the mind to investigate when it's cornered, it
 gathers its forces and manages to save itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha thus taught us to live in 'crucial' places — places where we're
 cornered, at the end of our rope — where we live simply, so that mindfulness
 and discernment can work full steam ahead and see their own capabilities,
 rather than simply waiting for help from others.
 Time and place can help give rise to mindfulness and discernment.
 If we live in a scary place, mindfulness is strong.
 Discernment is sharp.
 Whatever we investigate, they are adroit and audacious.
 If we live in a comfortable place, we get lazy.
 We eat a lot and sleep a lot.
 This is the way it is with the mind.
 If we live in ordinary circumstances, we're very lazy, very inert, very
 apathetic and listless.
 If we live in places that aren't scary, we become heedless and revert to
 being complacent, to sleeping like pigs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we live in a scary place, we're always alert.
 When we're alert, we're always self-aware, because alertness is what it
 means to be mindful.
 Mindfulness appears within us, always self-aware, always engaged in persistent
 effort.
 Whatever makes contact, we understand because we're not complacent, because
 we're always alert.
 This is why we're taught to live in whatever places are appropriate, because
 they can give good encouragement or support to our persistent effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we have comfortable huts in which to live — as we have here — everything
 cares for our every need.
 Food overflows our bowls.
 We're flooded day and night with fruit juice, soft drinks, cocoa, and coffee.
 Main course dishes and desserts come pouring in from every direction.
 If we lack mindfulness and discernment, we lie clutching our food, like
 a pig lying next to its hay and then climbing up to lie on the chopping
 block.
 As for the Dhamma, we have no hope of winning it.
 Any meditation monk who is 'clever' in this way is bound to go under in
 this way without a doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To have mindfulness and discernment, we have to think.
 However much of the necessities of life we may have, we must find tactics
 for keeping the mind in shape, to keep wary and uncomplacent like a deer
 wary of danger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In places where you don't have to be wary of food like this, the mind goes
 about thinking in another way to reform itself.
 There, where will you get an excess of anything? Everything is lacking.
 Insufficient.
 Some days you get enough alms to eat, some days you don't.
 'This way there's nothing to be concerned about, because you've been full
 and been hungry before.
 Even if you go without food for one or two days, you won't die.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how the heart deals with the problem, and so it isn't concerned
 about food or anything else.
 If there's nothing but rice, you eat rice — and you don't see that you're
 concerned about it.
 'After all, you've come to a place like this, so what's wrong with eating
 whatever's available? Where are you going to find anything to go with the
 rice? You've been fed rice ever since the day you were born, so what's
 wrong with eating just rice? Can you eat other things without rice? If
 eating other things is really special, you've already eaten a lot of them,
 so why aren't you ever full? You've come looking for the Dhamma, not for
 food.
 Why are you so worked up about your stomach? You've already eaten a lot,
 and yet nothing special has ever come of it.
 You're looking for the extraordinary Dhamma, so what business do you have
 getting worked up about food? An expert in Dhamma isn't an expert in eating.'
 The mind deals with the situation in the flash of an eye, and the end result
 is that it isn't concerned.
 This is how a meditation monk subdues himself — or in other words, subdues
 his greed for the necessities of life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And as a result of correcting itself in the matter of eating or not eating,
 the mind keeps spinning.
 You sit in meditation without getting tired.
 With no food in your stomach, what is there to get drowsy about? If you
 don't eat at all, you're not drowsy at all and can meditate with ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a tactic in teaching monks to practice the Dhamma 'rukkhamula-senasanam'
 — under the shade of trees, in the mountains, in the forest, in lonely
 places where it's scary — ahara-sappaya, where the food is amenable.
 'Amenable' here means that it doesn't disrupt the body, that it isn't harmful
 or toxic to the body; and that it doesn't disrupt the mind as well.
 'Amenable food' means nothing but rice sometimes, or just a little food,
 so that our meditation goes well.
 It's amenable for those intent on the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those of us who are intent on nourishing the stomach for the sake of
 the body can't do this at all.
 Otherwise we'll die — don't say I didn't warn you.
 Normally if we eat a lot, with nothing but good dishes to eat, then we
 sleep like pigs.
 How can this be amenable? It's amenable for the defilements, not for winning
 the Dhamma.
 It's amenable for the affairs of defilements and the affairs of pigs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term 'amenable food' has to refer to eating in a way that serves a purpose.
 To eat just a little serves a purpose: Wherever we sit in meditation, the
 mind is really solid.
 If we're involved with concentration, the mind is solid.
 If we're involved with discernment, it keeps spinning with much more agility
 than normal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma tends to arise in places where things are lacking, in difficult
 places where we're cornered, at the end of our rope.
 It doesn't arise where things are overflowing, where our needs are met.
 It doesn't arise in comfortable places because we just get complacent.
 This is the way we tend to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lord Buddha lived in a royal palace — for how long? — and then left
 it to take up the homeless life.
 Who ever suffered more than he? 'Buddha' — Awakening — tends to arise in
 situations like that.
 His disciples came from all sorts of families — the families of kings,
 financiers, landowners — listen to this — wealthy people.
 When they went out to become 'sons of the Sakyan, sons of the victorious
 Buddha,' how did they live? 'If we're going to die, then we die.
 We're not going to worry or be bothered with anything at all except for
 the Dhamma.' There! They gained the Dhamma in difficult places, just like
 the Buddha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So which way are we going to take? The Buddha has already shown us the way.
 The Dhamma arises in that sort of place — in tight spots where things are
 difficult.
 The Dhamma arises from a heap of suffering.
 If there's no heap of suffering, then mindfulness and discernment don't
 arise.
 If we don't think, we don't gain mindfulness and discernment.
 The Dhamma doesn't appear.
 If there's a lot of stress, it's a whetstone for discernment, which probes
 for clear insight into the affairs of stress.
 This way we can live through it and come out superlative people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then.
 Evam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Radiant Mind Is Unawareness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normally the mind is radiant and always ready to make contact with everything
 of every sort.
 Although all phenomena without exception fall under the laws of the three
 characteristics — stress, inconstancy, and not-self — the true nature of
 the mind doesn't fall under these laws.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extent to which the mind does follow these laws is because the things
 that fall under these three characteristics come spinning in and become
 involved with it, so that it goes spinning along with them.
 Even then, though, it spins in a way that doesn't disintegrate or fall
 apart.
 It spins with the things that have the power to make it spin, but the natural
 power of the mind itself is that it knows and does not die.
 This deathlessness is something that lies beyond disintegration.
 This non-disintegration is something that lies beyond the three characteristics
 and the common laws of nature, but we're not aware of it because conventional
 realities become involved with the mind and surround it, so that the mind's
 behavior conforms thoroughly to theirs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that we're unaware that birth and death are things that have always
 been with the mind infected by defilement, is because ignorance itself
 is an affair of defilement.
 Birth and death are an affair of defilement.
 Our own true affair, the affair that's ours pure and simple — the affair
 of the mind pure and simple — is that we don't have the power to be our
 own true self.
 We have been taking all sorts of counterfeit things as our self all along,
 and so the mind's behavior is not in keeping with its true nature.
 Its behavior falls under the sway of the deceits of defilement, which make
 it worry and fear, dreading death, dreading everything.
 Whatever happens — a little pain, a lot of pain — it's afraid.
 If even the least little thing disturbs it, it's afraid.
 As a result, the mind is filled with worries and fears.
 Even though fear and worry aren't directly an affair of the mind, they
 still manage to make it tremble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll see — when the mind is cleansed so that it is fully pure and nothing
 can become involved with it — that no fear appears in the mind at all.
 Fear doesn't appear.
 Courage doesn't appear.
 All that appears is its own nature by itself, just its own timeless nature.
 That's all.
 This is the genuine mind.
 'Genuine mind' here refers only to the purity or the 'saupadisesa-nibbana'
 of the arahants.
 Nothing else can be called the 'genuine mind' without reservations or hesitatio
ns.
 I, for one, would feel embarrassed to use the term for anything else at
 all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 'original mind' means the original mind of the round in which the mind
 finds itself spinning around and about, as in the Buddha's saying, 'Monks,
 the original mind is radiant' — notice that — 'but because of the admixture
 of defilements' or 'because of the defilements that come passing through,
 it becomes darkened.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original mind here refers to the origin of conventional realities, not
 to the origin of purity.
 The Buddha uses the term 'pabhassaram' — 'pabhassaramidam cittam bhikkhave'
 — which means radiant.
 It doesn't mean pure.
 The way he puts it is absolutely right.
 There is no way you can fault it.
 Had he said that the original mind is pure, you could immediately take
 issue: 'If the mind is pure, why is it born? Those who have purified their
 minds are never reborn.
 If the mind is already pure, why purify it?' Right here is where you could
 take issue.
 What reason would there be to purify it? If the mind is radiant, you can
 purify it because its radiance is unawareness incarnate, and nothing else.
 Meditators will see clearly for themselves the moment the mind passes from
 radiance to mental release: Radiance will no longer appear.
 Right here is the point where meditators clearly know this, and it's the
 point that lets them argue — because the truth has to be found true in
 the individual heart.
 Once a person knows, he or she can't help but speak with full assurance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the fact that our mind is surrounded, made to fear, to worry, to love,
 to hate, or whatever, is caused entirely by the symptoms of conventional
 reality, the symptoms of defilement.
 We have no mental power of our own.
 We have only the power of defilement, craving, and mental effluents pushing
 and pressuring us day and night while we sit, stand, walk, and lie down.
 Where are we going to find any happiness and ease as long as these things,
 which are constantly changing, keep provoking the mind to change along
 with them without our being aware of the fact?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There can be no ease in this world — none at all — until these things can
 be completely eradicated from the heart.
 Until then, we can have no secure ease and relief in any way.
 We can only shift and change about, or lean this way and that, depending
 on how much we're provoked by the things that come and involve us.
 This is why the Buddha teaches us to cleanse the mind, which is the same
 thing as cleansing ourselves of suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no one who has genuinely penetrated the principles of the truth
 like the Lord Buddha.
 Only he can be called 'sayambhu' — one who needs no teaching or training
 from anyone else.
 In curing his heart of defilement, he performed the duties of both student
 and teacher, all by himself, until he awakened to the level of the superlative
 Dhamma, becoming the superlative person, the superlative Master.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is not to deny that on the level of concentration — the development
 of mental stillness — he received training from the two hermits; but that
 in itself wasn't the way of extrication leading to the level of omniscience
 (sabbaññu).
 By the time he was to attain omniscience, he had left the two hermits and
 was striving on his own.
 He came to know the Dhamma on his own and to see on his own, without anyone
 else's teaching him.
 He then brought that Dhamma to teach the world so that it has known good
 and evil, heaven, hell, and nibbana ever since.
 Had there been no one to teach us, we of the world would be completely
 burdened with the mass of fire filling our hearts and would never see the
 day when we could put our burdens down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This being the case, we should appreciate the worth of the Dhamma that the
 Buddha brought to the world after having endured hardships in a way no
 one else in the world could have managed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now, at present, what is it that covers the heart so that we can't find
 its radiance and purity, even though each of us wants to find purity.
 What conceals it? To answer in terms of natural principles, we should start
 with the five khandhas.
 As for the 'mind of unawareness,' we can save that for later.
 Let's just start out with what's really obvious — the five khandhas and
 their companions: sight, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These make contact with the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, and then link
 up with the mind, forming the basis for this assumption and that.
 The mind then takes the objects that have come passing by and uses them
 to bind itself, entangle itself, or encircle itself so that it is completely
 darkened with love, hate, anger, and all sorts of other states, all of
 which come from the things I have mentioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what lies buried deep is our belief that the khandhas form our self.
 From time immemorial, whatever our language, whatever our race — even when
 we are common animals — we have to believe that these things are us, are
 ours; that they are a being, the self of a being, our own self.
 If we become deities, we believe that our divine bodies are ours.
 If we become hungry ghosts or whatever, the things we dwell in — gross
 bodies or refined — we take to be us or ours.
 Even when we become human beings and begin to have some sense of good and
 evil, we still have to believe that 'This is us,' or 'This is ours.' Of
 the five khandhas, the body (rupa) is 'us.' Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and
 viññana are 'us,' are 'ours.' These assumptions lie buried deep within us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha thus teaches us to investigate.
 We investigate these things so as to see their truth clearly and then to
 uproot our mistaken assumptions and attachments that they are the self.
 We do this for the sake of freedom and for nothing else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we look at these things in their normal state, we might wonder why we
 should investigate them.
 Sights are simply sights; sounds are sounds; smells, smells; tastes, tastes;
 tactile sensations are simply natural phenomena as they've always been.
 They've never announced that they are our enemies.
 So why investigate them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We investigate them to know the truth of each one of them as it actually
 is, to realize our own delusions by means of this investigation and to
 extricate ourselves from them through knowledge — for the fact that the
 mind lays claim to the khandhas as its self, as belonging to itself, is
 because of delusion and nothing else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have investigated and clearly understood what these things are,
 the mind withdraws inwardly through knowledge, understanding, and discernment,
 with no more concern for these things.
 We investigate whichever khandha is most prominent.
 We needn't conjecture or speculate about the fact that we haven't contemplated
 the five khandhas in their entirety, or each khandha in turn.
 We needn't conjecture at all.
 All we need to do is to see which khandha is prominent and merits investigation
 at the moment — which khandha we feel best suited to handle — and then
 investigate and explore it so that it becomes clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take, for instance, the body, whichever aspect of the body is most prominent
 in your awareness — the aspect that has you most interested, that you want
 most to investigate.
 Latch onto that spot and focus on examining it so as to see its truth in
 terms of the question, 'What is stress?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the texts we are told that stress (dukkha) means 'unendurability,' but
 this doesn't sit well with my own crass tastes, which is why — one man's
 meat being another man's poison — I prefer to translate stress as 'a constant
 squeeze.' This is more in keeping with my tastes, which are very crude.
 For example, the phrase, 'yampiccham na labhati tampi dukkham,' is right
 in line with my translation.
 In other words, 'Not attaining what is desired is stress.' How is it stress?
 In that it puts a squeeze on us, or makes us uncomfortable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we don't get what we want, we're uncomfortable.
 Even if we get what we want but then lose it, we suffer stress.
 Stress in this sense fits the translation, 'a squeeze.' This squeeze is
 what's meant by stress or unendurability.
 If it can't endure, let it go its own way.
 Why mess with it? Actually, no matter which khandha, no matter which of
 the three characteristics, the mind is the one at fault for getting attached,
 which is why we have to examine the khandhas until we have them clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever aspect of the body, look so as to see it clearly.
 If we're not yet clear about the filthiness in our 'physical heap,' we
 can look at the charnel ground within us so as to see it clearly.
 When we're told to visit the charnel ground, this is where we make our
 visit.
 Even if we visit a charnel ground outside, the purpose is to reflect inwardly
 on the inner charnel ground — our own body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the external charnel ground, in the days of the Buddha it was a place
 where corpses were scattered all over the place.
 The dead were hardly ever buried or cremated as they are today.
 So the Buddha taught monks to visit the charnel ground, where old corpses
 and new were scattered everywhere.
 He also gave detailed instructions as to the direction from which to enter,
 in keeping with his sharp intelligence as a self-dependent Buddha, the
 Teacher of the world.
 He said to approach from the upwind side and not from the downwind side.
 Otherwise the stench of the various corpses would be bad for your health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'When you encounter corpses in this way, how do you feel? Look at the different
 types of corpses.
 How do you feel? Now refer inwardly, to your own body, which is another
 corpse.' This is how he taught the monks to investigate.
 Once we have an eyewitness — ourself — as to what the corpses in the external
 charnel ground are like, we can refer inwardly to the internal charnel
 ground: ourself again.
 Once we have grasped the basic principle, the external charnel ground gradually
 fades out of the picture.
 Instead, we investigate our internal charnel ground so that it becomes
 gradually more and more clear.
 In other words, we see how this body is a well of filth.
 Repulsive.
 Something that constantly has to be washed, bathed, and cleaned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is there anything that, once it has become involved with any part of the
 body, remains clean? Even the food we eat, once we consume it, becomes
 filthy from the moment it enters the mouth and passes on down.
 Our clothing is also dirty.
 It has to be washed and laundered — a lot of fuss and bother.
 The same holds true for our homes.
 They constantly have to be cleaned, scrubbed, dusted, and swept.
 Otherwise they turn into another charnel ground because of the filth and
 the smell.
 Everywhere, wherever human beings live, has to be cleaned — because human
 beings are filthy.
 And since our bodies are already filthy, everything that comes into contact
 with them becomes filthy.
 Even food — delicious, inviting, appealing food — once it becomes mixed
 with the filth in the body, such as saliva, becomes filthy as well.
 If you took food of various kinds into your mouth and then spit it out,
 there'd be no way you could take it back in again.
 It'd be too disgusting.
 Revolting.
 Why? Because the body is filthy by its very nature, and so whatever becomes
 involved with the body becomes filthy as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To contemplate in this way is called investigating the charnel ground, or
 investigating the theme of loathsomeness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 Focus in on seeing its inherent nature.
 Look at every facet, in whichever way comes most naturally to you.
 When you've examined one spot, your knowledge gradually seeps into the
 next spot and the next.
 If mindfulness and awareness keep in close connection, discernment can't
 help but go to work and advance unceasingly.
 You'll feel profoundly moved as you come to see and know truly, step by
 step.
 This is discernment on the first level of investigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you've investigated filthiness, you then investigate the process of
 change in the body.
 In other words, filth is in this body.
 Dry corpses, fresh corpses, raw corpses, cooked corpses, all kinds of corpses
 are gathered together in this body, but I've never heard the place where
 they are barbecued, roasted, and stewed called a crematorium.
 Instead, it's called kitchen.
 But actually, that's what it is, a crematorium for animals.
 And then they're all buried here in this stomach, this grave.
 We're a burial ground for all kinds of animals — yes, us! — if we look
 at ourselves in all fairness, with impartiality, because we're filled with
 old corpses and new.
 Once we have contemplated in this way, then if we don't feel disenchantment,
 if we don't feel disengagement, what will we feel? — for that's the way
 the truth actually is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught us to get to the truth, because this is what the truth
 is.
 If we don't resist the truth, we will all be able to unshackle ourselves
 from our attachments and false assumptions — from our stupidity and foolishness
 — step by step.
 The mind will become bright and clear, radiating its brightness with dignity,
 bravery, and courage in the face of the truth that comes into contact with
 it at all times.
 It will be content to accept every facet of the truth with fairness and
 impartiality.
 Even though we may not have yet abandoned our attachments absolutely, we
 can still find relief in having put them down to at least some extent.
 We no longer have to be constantly weighed down with our attachments to
 the khandhas to the point where we are always miserable.
 This is in keeping with the saying, 'Fools, the heavier their burdens,
 the more they keep piling on.
 Sages, the lighter their burdens, the more they let go — until nothing
 is left.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we investigate in this way, we should examine the process of change
 in the khandhas.
 Every piece, every bit, every part of the body undergoes change.
 There's no exception, not even for a single hair.
 Everything undergoes change in the same way.
 So which part is us, which part is ours, to which we should be attached?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same holds true with the word 'anatta,' not-self.
 It drives home even more firmly the fact that these things don't deserve
 our attachment.
 'Anatta' lies in the same parts as change — the very same parts.
 They're anatta, not ours or anyone else's.
 Each one, each one is simply a natural phenomenon mingled with the others
 in line with its own nature, without any concern for who will like it or
 hate it, latch onto it or let it go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we human beings are light-fingered and quick.
 Whatever comes our way, we snatch hold of it, snatch hold of it, with no
 concern for right or wrong.
 We're more light-fingered and quick than a hundred monkeys, and yet all
 of us, all over the world, like to criticize monkeys for not being able
 to sit contented and still.
 Actually we ourselves can't stay contented and still in any position.
 We're full of restlessness — unruly, reckless, overflowing our boundaries
 — and yet we never think of criticizing ourselves.
 The Dhamma taught by the Buddha is thus like a stick for slapping the hands
 of this light-fingered, unruly monkey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the three characteristics, anatta among them, he warns us, strikes
 our wrists: 'Don't reach!' He slaps us, strikes us: 'Don't reach for it
 as "me" or "mine."' The phrase, 'The body is not the self,' is just like
 that.
 'Don't reach for it.
 Don't latch onto it.' This is simply so that we will see that it's already
 not-self.
 By its nature it's not-self.
 It doesn't belong to anyone at all.
 He's already told us: 'Anatta: It's not the self.' This is how we investigate
 the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, now then: Focus on visualizing it as it disintegrates, in whichever
 way seems most natural to you.
 This part decomposes.
 That part decomposes.
 This part falls off.
 That part falls off.
 Let yourself become engrossed in watching it, using your own ingenuity.
 This falls off, that falls off, until everything has fallen apart — all
 the bones, from the skull on down.
 Once the skin that enwraps them has decomposed, the flesh has decomposed,
 the tendons that hold them together have decomposed, the bones can't help
 but fall apart, piece by piece, because they are held together only by
 tendons.
 Once the tendons decompose, the different parts have to fall off piece
 by piece in a pile on the ground, scattered all over the place.
 You can even visualize having vultures, crows, and dogs come to eat and
 scatter the parts everywhere.
 How does the mind feel about this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well then, look at it.
 Visualize the liquid parts seeping into the earth and evaporating into
 the air, then drying away, drying away until they no longer appear.
 The solid parts, once they've dried, return to the earth from which they
 came.
 Earth returns to earth, water to water, wind to wind.
 Penetrate down into any of four elements — earth, water, wind, or fire
 — because each gives clear evidence of the Noble Truths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We don't have to think that we've examined earth clearly, but this element
 or that element isn't clear.
 We needn't think that way at all.
 If we examine any one of them until it's clear, we will penetrate them
 all, because earth, water, wind, and fire are all already open and aboveboard.
 They appear to our sight.
 In our body, we already have water.
 Wind — for example, the in-and-out breath — is already clearly there, already
 clear to see.
 Fire — the warmth in the body — is something we all have here in our bodies.
 So why don't we accept its truth with right discernment? Once we've investigate
d it over and over again, we have to accept it.
 We can't resist the truth, because that's why we're here: We want the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So keep investigating.
 Look for the part that's 'you' or 'yours.' Look for it! There isn't any
 — not a one! The whole thing originally belongs to them: to earth, water,
 wind, and fire.
 It originally belongs to the different elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, when you look in this manner, the mind can settle down and grow still.
 At the same time, these aren't preoccupations that will make the mind proud,
 conceited, or unruly.
 Rather, they are themes that calm the heart, which is why the Buddha taught
 us to investigate them repeatedly until we understand and become adept
 at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind sees clearly with its own discernment, it can't help but withdraw
 into stillness, firmly centered within, letting go of all its cares.
 This is one level in the investigation of the khandhas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now for the next step: Investigate feelings of pain, especially when you
 are ill or have been sitting in meditation for a long time, and severe
 pain arises.
 Take it on, right there.
 A warrior has to fight when the enemy appears.
 If there's no enemy, how can you call him a warrior? And what's the enemy?
 Feelings of pain, the enemy of the heart.
 When you're ill, where does it hurt? There: You have your enemy.
 If you're a warrior, how can you run away and hide? You have to fight until
 you gain knowledge and then use that knowledge to come out victorious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 What does the pain come from? From the time we were born until we first
 sat in meditation, it wasn't there.
 Before we first became ill, it didn't appear.
 It appears only now that we're ill.
 Before that, where was it hiding? If it's really 'us,' our mind should
 have been aware of it at all times, so why hasn't this kind of pain appeared
 at all times? Why is it appearing now? If the pain is 'us,' then when it
 vanishes why doesn't the mind vanish with it? If they're really one and
 the same thing, they have to vanish together.
 The pain should appear as long as the mind is aware.
 If they're one and the same thing, the pain shouldn't vanish.
 You have to look and investigate until this is clear.
 At the same time, analyze the body when the pain arises — when, for example,
 your legs ache or when this or that bone hurts.
 Fix your attention on the bone if the bone is really hurting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the bone the pain? Ask yourself! And whatever you're asking about, focus
 your attention right there.
 Don't ask in the abstract or absentmindedly.
 Ask in a way that focuses the mind right down to see the truth.
 Focus steadily right on the pain.
 Stare the mind right down on whichever bone you identify with the pain.
 Look carefully to see, 'Is this bone the pain?' Fix your attention there.
 Really observe with your own discernment.
 If this bone is really the pain, then when the pain vanishes, why doesn't
 the bone vanish with it? If they really are one and the same thing, then
 when the pain vanishes, the bone should vanish too.
 It shouldn't remain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But look: When the disease goes away, or when we get up from sitting in
 meditation, the really severe pain vanishes, the stress vanishes.
 So if they are one and the same thing, why doesn't the bone vanish as well?
 This shows that they aren't one and the same.
 The feeling isn't the same as the body.
 The body isn't the same as the feeling.
 Similarly, the body and the mind aren't one and the same.
 Each has its own separate reality.
 Distinguish them so as to see them clearly in line with this truth, and
 you'll understand their true nature through discernment, with no doubts
 at all.
 Feeling will appear in its true nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, the investigation will come circling in, circling in, circling
 in to the mind.
 The pain will gradually shrink into itself, away from the mind's assumptions.
 In other words, you will see that the mind is the culprit.
 The mind is the instigator.
 The physical pain will gradually subside and fade away.
 The body will simply be there as the body, with the same reality it had
 before the pain appeared.
 And now that the pain has vanished, the flesh, skin, tendon, bone or whatever
 part you had identified as the pain will maintain its reality in the same
 way.
 It isn't the pain.
 The body is the body.
 The feeling is the feeling.
 The mind is the mind.
 Fix your attention on seeing them clearly.
 Once the mind has penetrated to the truth, the pain will disappear.
 This is one result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another result is that even if the pain doesn't vanish — here I'm referring
 to the physical pain — still it can't have any impact on the heart and
 mind.
 Ultimately, the mind is serene, secure, and majestic, there in the midst
 of the physical pain.
 No matter which part of the body you say is pained — even if it's the whole
 body at once — the mind isn't disturbed or agitated in any way.
 It's relaxed and at ease because it has seen with discernment right through
 the pain appearing at the moment.
 This is another sort of result that comes from investigating pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When investigating pain, then the greater the pain, the more important it
 is that your mindfulness and discernment not retreat.
 They have to keep advancing so as to know the truth.
 You needn't aim at making the pain vanish, because such a desire would
 simply enhance the pain and make it more and more severe.
 Actually, you're making an investigation simply to see the truth.
 Whether or not the pain vanishes, know the truth that is the pain or gives
 rise to the pain by seeing through it with your own discernment: That's
 enough.
 Fix your attention there, and these things will keep appearing and disappearing
 there in the khandhas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The body appears for a certain period and then disintegrates in what we
 call death.
 As for feelings of pain, they appear a hundred times in a single day and
 then disappear a hundred times, a thousand times as well.
 What's lasting about them? This is the kind of truth they are.
 Get so you clearly know with discernment the truth of painful feelings
 as they appear.
 Don't retreat or let the mind wander adrift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is sañña labeling at the moment? Sañña is the important instigator.
 As soon as sankhara fashions anything — blip! — sañña latches right onto
 it and labels it this, labels it that — stirring things all up.
 When we talk about the things that create havoc, provoking this issue and
 that, we're referring to these characters: sankharas and saññas that label
 things and stamp meanings on them.
 'This is us.
 This is ours.
 This is pain.
 It hurts right here.
 It hurts right there.
 I'm afraid of the pain.
 I'm afraid to die' — afraid of everything of every sort.
 These are the characters that fool us into fear, making the mind apprehensive,
 making it give up its efforts and lose.
 Is it good to lose? Even children playing games have a sense of shame when
 they lose, and try to make up their losses.
 As for meditators who lose out to defilement, who lose out to pain: If
 they don't feel embarrassed in the presence of the defilements, the pains
 and themselves, then they're simply too shameless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Know that vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana are simply individual conditions
 displayed by the mind.
 They appear and vanish.
 'Sañña anatta' — see? They too are not-self, so how can you hold to them?
 How can you believe them to be you, to be yours, to be true? Keep track
 of them so that you can know them clearly with mindfulness and discernment:
 audacious, undaunted, diamond-hearted, decisive in the face of defilement
 and pain of every sort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sankharas, mental formations: They form — blip, blip, blip — in the heart.
 The heart ripples for a moment: blip, blip, blip.
 The moment they arise, they vanish.
 So what substance or truth can you find in these saññas and sankharas?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viññana, cognizance: As soon as anything comes into contact, this takes
 note and vanishes, takes note and vanishes.
 So ultimately, the khandhas are full of nothing but appearing and vanishing.
 There's nothing lasting about them that can give us any real sustenance
 or nourishment.
 There's not even the least bit of substance to them.
 So use your discernment to investigate until you see clearly in this way,
 and you will come to see the real Dhamma taught by the Buddha, which has
 not been otherwise from time immemorial and by the same token will never
 be otherwise at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we've investigated to this extent, how can the mind not withdraw into
 stillness until it is plainly apparent? It has to be still.
 It has to stand out.
 The mind's awareness of itself has to be prominent because it has withdrawn
 inwardly from having seen the truth of these things.
 The mind has to be prominent.
 Pain, no matter how horribly severe, will dissolve away through investigation,
 through the mind's having clearly seen its truth.
 Or if it doesn't go away, then the pain and the mind will each have their
 own separate reality.
 The heart will be inwardly majestic.
 Undaunted.
 Unfearing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the time comes for death, let it happen.
 There is no more fear, because death is entirely a matter of rupa, vedana,
 sañña, sankhara, and viññana.
 It's not a matter of the 'knower' — the heart — breaking apart.
 It's not the knower — the heart — that dies.
 Only those other things die.
 The mind's labels and assumptions have simply fooled it into fear.
 If we can catch sight of the fact that these labels and assumptions are
 illusions and not worthy of credence, the mind will withdraw inwardly,
 no longer believing them, but believing the truth instead, believing the
 discernment that has investigated things thoroughly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, when the mind has investigated time and again, ceaselessly, relentlessly,
 it will develop expertise in the affairs of the khandhas.
 The physical khandha will be the first to be relinquished through discernment.
 In the beginning stage of the investigation, discernment will see through
 the physical khandha before seeing through the others and will be able
 to let it go.
 From there, the mind will gradually be able to let go of vedana, sañña,
 sankhara, and viññana at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To put the matter simply, once discernment sees through them, it lets go.
 If it has yet to see through them, it holds on.
 Once we see through them with discernment, we let them go — let them go
 completely — because we see that they are simply ripplings in the mind
 — blip, blip, blip — without any substance at all.
 A good thought appears and vanishes.
 A bad thought appears and vanishes.
 Whatever kind of thought appears, it's simply a formation and as such it
 vanishes.
 If a hundred formations appear, all hundred of them vanish.
 There is no permanence to them substantial enough for us to trust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then.
 What is it that keeps supplying us with these things or keeps forcing them
 out on us? What is it that keeps forcing this thing and that out to fool
 us? This is where we come to what the Buddha calls the pabhassara-citta:
 the original, radiant mind.
 'But monks, because of the admixture of defilement,' or 'because of the
 defilements that come passing through' — from sights, sound, smells, tastes,
 tactile sensations; from rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana, that
 our labels and assumptions haul in to burn us — 'the mind becomes defiled.'
 It's defiled with just these very things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus investigation is for the sake of removing these things so as to reveal
 the mind through clear discernment.
 We can then see that as long as the mind is at the stage where it hasn't
 ventured out to become engaged in any object — inasmuch as its instruments,
 the senses, are still weak and undeveloped — it is quiet and radiant, as
 in the saying, 'The original mind is the radiant mind.' But this is the
 original mind of the round of rebirth — for example, the mind of a newborn
 child whose activities are still too undeveloped to take any objects on
 fully.
 It's not the original mind freed from the cycle and fully pure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So while we investigate around us stage by stage, the symptoms of defilement
 that used to run all over the place will be gathered into this single point,
 becoming a radiance within the mind.
 And this radiance: Even the tools of super-mindfulness and super-discernment
 will have to fall for it when they first meet with it, because it's something
 we have never seen before, never met before, from the beginning of our
 practice or from the day of our birth.
 We thus become awed and amazed.
 It seems for the moment that nothing can compare to it in magnificence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And why shouldn't it be magnificent? It has been the king of the round of
 rebirth in all three worlds — the world of sensuality, the world of form,
 and the world of formlessness — since way back when, for countless aeons.
 It's the one who has wielded power over the mind and ruled the mind all
 along.
 As long as the mind doesn't possess the mindfulness and discernment to
 pull itself out from under this power, how can it not be magnificent? This
 is why it has been able to drive the mind into experiencing birth on various
 levels without limit, in dependence on the fruits of the different actions
 it has performed under the orders of the ephemeral defilements.
 The fact that living beings wander and stray, taking birth and dying unceasingl
y, is because this nature leads them to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This being the case, we have to investigate it so as to see it plainly.
 Actually, radiance and defilement are two sides of the same coin because
 they are both conventional realities.
 The radiance that comes from the convergence of the various defilements
 will form a point, a center, so that we can clearly perceive that 'This
 is the center of the radiance.' When any defilement appears, in correspondence
 with that state or level of the mind, a very refined stress will arise
 in the center we call radiant.
 Thus radiance, defilement, and stress — all three — are companions.
 They go together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, the mind possessing this radiance must worry over it, guard
 it, protect it, maintain it, for fear that something may come to disturb
 it, jar it, obscure its radiance.
 Even the most refined adulteration is still an affair of defilement, about
 which we as meditators should not be complacent.
 We must investigate it with unflagging discernment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to cut through the burden of your concerns once and for all, you
 should ask yourself, 'What is this radiance?' Fix your attention on it
 until you know.
 There's no need to fear that once this radiance is destroyed, the 'real
 you' will be destroyed along with it.
 Focus your investigation right at that center to see clearly that this
 radiance has the characteristics of inconstancy, stress, and not-self just
 like all the other phenomena you have already examined.
 It's not different in any way, aside from the difference in its subtlety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus nothing should be taken for granted.
 If anything has the nature of conventional reality, let discernment slash
 away at it.
 Focus right down on the mind itself.
 All the really counterfeit things lie in the mind.
 This radiance is the ultimate counterfeit and at that moment it's the most
 conspicuous point.
 You hardly want to touch it at all, because you love it and cherish it
 more than anything else.
 In the entire body there is nothing more outstanding than this radiance,
 which is why you are amazed at it, love it, cherish it, dawdle over it,
 want nothing to touch it.
 But it's the enemy king: unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have you ever seen it? If you haven't, then when you reach this stage in
 your practice you'll fall for it of your own accord.
 And then you'll know it of your own accord — no one will have to tell you
 — when mindfulness and discernment are ready.
 It's called avijja — unawareness.
 Right here is the true unawareness.
 Nothing else is true unawareness.
 Don't go imagining avijja as a tiger, a leopard, a demon, or a beast.
 Actually, it's the most beautiful, most alluring Miss Universe the world
 has ever seen.
 Genuine unawareness is very different from what we expect it to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we reach genuine unawareness, we don't know what unawareness is and
 so we get stuck right there.
 If there's no one to advise us, no one to suggest an approach, we are sure
 to stay stuck there a long time before we can understand and work ourselves
 free.
 But if there is someone to suggest an approach, we can begin to understand
 it and strike right at that center, without trusting it, by investigating
 it in the same way we have dealt with all other phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we've investigated it with sharp discernment until we know it clearly,
 this phenomenon will dissolve away in a completely unexpected way.
 At the same time, you could call it Awakening, or closing down the cemeteries
 of the round of rebirth, the round of the mind, under the shade of the
 Bodhi tree.
 Once this phenomenon has dissolved away, something even more amazing that
 has been concealed by unawareness will be revealed in all its fullness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is what is said to be like the quaking of the cosmos within the heart.
 This is a very crucial mental moment: when the heart breaks away from conventio
ns.
 This moment, when release and conventional reality break away from each
 other, is more awesome than can be expressed.
 The phrase, 'the path of arahantship giving way to the fruition of arahantship'
 refers to precisely this mental moment, the moment in which unawareness
 vanishes.
 As we are taught, when the path is fully developed, it steps onward to
 the fruition of arahantship, which is the Dhamma — the mind — at its most
 complete.
 From that moment on, there are no more problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The phrase, 'the one nibbana,'1 is fully realized in this heart in the moment
 unawareness is dissolving.
 We are taught that this is the moment when the path and the fruition —
 which are a pair — come together and meet.
 If we were to make a comparison with climbing the stairs to a house, one
 foot is on the last step, the other foot is on the floor of the house.
 We haven't yet reached the house with both feet.
 When both feet are on the floor of the house, we've 'reached the house.'
 As for the mind, it is said to reach the Dhamma or to attain the ultimate
 Dhamma, and from the moment of attainment it's called 'the one nibbana.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, the mind is completely free.
 It displays no further activity for the removal of defilement.
 This is called the one nibbana.
 If you want, you can call it the fruition of arahantship, for at this stage
 there are no more defilements to quibble.
 Or you can call it the one nibbana.
 But if you want to give it the conventional label most appropriate to the
 actual principle, so that nothing is deficient in conventional terms, you
 have to say 'the one nibbana' so as to be completely fitting with conventional
 reality and release in the final phase of wiping out the cemeteries of
 the mind of unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
n'atthi santi param sukham:There is no ease other than peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This refers to the stage of those who have no more defilements, who have
 attained sa-upadisesa-nibbana alive, such as the arahants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To practice the religion means to attend to your own heart and mind.
 Who is it that suffers pain and difficulty? Who is the suspect, forever
 imprisoned? Who else, if not the mind? And who has it imprisoned, if not
 all the defilements and mental effluents? To deal with the situation, you
 have to deal directly with the enemies of the heart, using your discernment,
 for only sharp discernment is capable of dealing with the defilements until
 they dissolve away of their own accord, as I have already mentioned.
 From that point on, there are no more problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana, they're simply conditions
 — just conditions — no longer capable of affecting or provoking the mind.
 The same with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations: Each
 has its separate reality.
 To each one we say, 'If it exists, it exists.
 If not, no matter.' The only problem has been the mind that makes labels
 and assumptions through its own stupidity.
 Once it gains enough intelligence, it becomes real.
 All phenomena within and without are real.
 Each has its own separate reality, with no more of the conflicts or issues
 that used to occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we reach the stage where 'each has its own separate reality,' we can
 say that the war between the mind and defilement is over.
 When the time comes to part, we part.
 If not, we live together, like everyone else in the world, but we don't
 take issue with each other like everyone else in the world, because we've
 made our investigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the words 'inconstancy, stress, and not-self' don't refer to the khandhas
 for which we are responsible, what do they refer to? So now we have completed
 our studies — our study of the three characteristics (tilakkhana), rather
 than of the three divisions (tipitaka) of the Pali canon, although actually
 the three divisions are nothing other than the three characteristics, in
 that the three divisions are a description of the three characteristics
 throughout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inconstancy: the process of change.
 Stress.
 Not-self: The khandhas are not us — not us while we are living, so when
 we die what is there to latch onto? When you see the truth in this way,
 you don't worry or feel apprehensive over the life or death of the khandhas.
 The mind simply perceives the modes in which the khandhas behave and break
 apart, but by its nature it doesn't disband along with the khandhas, so
 there's nothing to fear.
 If death comes, you don't try to prevent it.
 It life continues, you don't try to prevent it, for each is a truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In completing your study of death, you become the ultimate person — the
 ultimate you.
 When you have completed your study of death, you don't fear death — 'If
 life continues, let it continue; if death comes, let it die' — for you
 have spread a net around yourself with your discernment.
 You don't tremble over the truths of which the heart is fully aware at
 all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 That's enough for now.
 As it happens, we're at the end of the tape...

A talk given to the monks at Wat Pa Baan Taad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ordinary mind — no matter whose — when it doesn't yet have any standards
 and meets up with things that drag it here and there in the wrong directions,
 will tend to go rolling after those preoccupations without let-up, to the
 point where it can't find any foundation for sustaining its peace and calm.
 In terms of the Dhamma, these preoccupations are called defilements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see them when we begin to practice: The mind stumbles and crawls
 along, not at all willing to follow the Dhamma, because the defilements
 are strong.
 This is something I haven't forgotten, from the time I first set out to
 practice up until now, because it's a truth that lies embedded in the heart.
 How could I forget?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the very start of my practice, I was really in earnest — because that's
 the sort of person I was.
 I wouldn't just play around.
 Wherever I would take my stance, that's how it would have to be.
 When I set out to practice, I had only one book — the Patimokkha — in my
 shoulder bag.
 Now I was going for the full path and the full results.
 I was going to give it my all — give it my life.
 I wasn't going to hope for anything else.
 I was going to hope for nothing but release from suffering.
 I was sure that I would attain release from suffering in this lifetime.
 All I asked was that there be someone who could show me that the paths,
 fruitions, and nibbana were for real.
 I would give my life to that person and to the Dhamma through the practice,
 without holding anything back.
 If I was to die, I'd die with the practice.
 I wouldn't die with retreat.
 My heart was set like a stone post.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first rains after I had set out to practice, I spent in Cakkaraad District,
 Korat Province, because I hadn't been able to catch up with Venerable Acariya
 Mun.
 I began accelerating my efforts as soon as I got there, and it wasn't long
 before my mind attained stillness, because I was practicing both day and
 night.
 I wasn't willing to do any other work aside from the work of concentration
 practice — sitting and walking meditation — in my own stumbling and crawling
 way.
 My mind was able to quiet down, so I really accelerated my efforts; but
 then, as I've told you before, it regressed when I was making a klod.2 Up
 to that point, I was no mean hand at concentration.
 It was really solid.
 I was sure that the paths, fruitions, and nibbana were for real, because
 the mind was really solid.
 It wasn't affected by anything at all.
 But even then it still managed to regress just because I made a single
 klod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I reached Venerable Acariya Mun, he taught me the Dhamma as if it came
 straight out of his heart.
 He would never use the words, 'It seems to be...,' because it really came
 right out of his heart — how he had practiced, what he had known and seen.
 It was as if he kept saying, 'Right here.
 Right here.' So did he see or didn't he? Did he know or didn't he? 'Right
 here.' Where were the paths, fruitions, and nibbana? 'Right here.
 Right here.' My mind was convinced, really convinced.
 From that point on I made a resolution: As long as he was still alive,
 I wouldn't leave him until either he died or I did.
 As for going off from time to time to practice on my own, I'd ask to do
 that as a matter of course, but I'd take him as my base, as if my home
 were with him.
 No matter where I'd go, I'd have to return to him.
 So then I stepped up my efforts full speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That dream I had — I'll never forget it.
 I've told you all this dream before, but it had such an impact on me that
 it bears telling again.
 I had come to stay with him and made my resolution with full conviction,
 with complete faith in him.
 There was no point on which you could fault him.
 Whatever he did, inwardly or outwardly, was right in line with the principles
 of the Dhamma and Vinaya.
 There was nothing roundabout or evasive about him.
 That was why I had made up my mind to stay with him.
 If he were alive today, I still wouldn't leave him.
 I'd have to stay with him, although as a matter of course I'd still go
 here or there from time to time, as I had told myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was only around the fourth or fifth night after I had gone to stay with
 him...
 this dream, you know, was really amazing.
 I dreamed that I was fully robed, carrying my bowl and klod, following
 an overgrown trail through the jungle.
 There were no side paths on either side.
 Both sides were full of thorns and brambles.
 All I could do was to keep trying to follow the trail, which was just barely
 a path, all overgrown, just enough to give a hint of where to go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally I reached a point where a thick clump of bamboo had fallen across
 the trail.
 I couldn't see which way to go.
 There was no way around it on either side.
 How was I going to get past it? I peered here and there until finally I
 saw an opening — a tiny opening, right along the path, just enough for
 me to force my way through together with my bowl.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there was no other way, I removed my outer robe — that's how clear
 the dream was, as if I weren't dreaming at all — I removed my outer robe
 and folded it away, just as we keep our robes folded here.
 I removed my bowl strap from my shoulder and crawled through the opening,
 dragging my bowl by its strap and pulling my klod just within reach behind
 me.
 I was able to force my way through, dragging my bowl, my klod and my robe
 behind me, but it was really difficult.
 I kept at it for a long time until finally I worked my way free.
 I pulled my bowl, and my bowl came free.
 I pulled my klod, and my klod came free.
 I pulled my robe, and my robe came free.
 As soon as I was entirely free, I put on my robe again — that's how clear
 the dream was — I put on my robe, slung my bowl over my shoulder, and told
 myself, 'Now I can go on.' I kept following that trail-it was really overgrown
 — for about another 40 meters, wearing my robe, carrying my bowl and klod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking ahead, there was wide open space.
 In front of me was the ocean.
 Looking across, there was no further shore.
 All I could see was the shore on which I was standing and a tiny island,
 way out in the distance, a black speck on the edge of the horizon.
 I was going to that island.
 As soon as I walked down to the water's edge, a boat — I don't know where
 it came from and I didn't notice whether it was a speedboat or a rowboat
 or whatever — a boat came up to the shore and I got in.
 The boatsman didn't say anything to me.
 As soon as I sat down in the boat and got my bowl and other things in,
 the boat sped out to the island, without my having to say a word.
 I don't know how it happened.
 It kept speeding, speeding out to the island.
 There didn't seem to be any dangers or waves or anything at all.
 We went silently and in no time at all we arrived — because, after all,
 it was a dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as I reached the island, I got my things out of the boat and went
 ashore.
 The boat disappeared completely, without my saying even a word to the boatsman.
 I slung my bowl over my shoulder and climbed up the island.
 I kept climbing until I saw Venerable Acariya Mun sitting on a small bench,
 pounding his betel nut and watching me climb up towards him.
 'Maha,' he said, 'how did you get here? Since when has anyone come that
 way? How were you able to make it here?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'I came by boat.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Oho.
 That trail is really difficult.
 Nobody dares risk his life coming that way.
 Very well then, now that you're here, pound my betel for me.' He handed
 me his betel pounder, and so I pounded away — chock, chock, chock.
 After the second or third chock, I woke up.
 I felt really disappointed.
 I wished I could have continued with the dream to see at least how it ended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That morning I went to tell my dream to Venerable Acariya Mun.
 He interpreted it very well.
 'This dream, you know,' he said, 'is very auspicious.
 It shows the pattern for your practice without any deviations.
 Follow the practice in the way that you've dreamed.
 In the beginning, it'll be extremely difficult.' That's what he said.
 'You have to give it your best.
 Don't retreat.
 The beginning will be difficult.
 The part where you made it through the clump of bamboo: That's the difficult
 part.
 So give it your best.
 Don't you ever retreat.
 Once you get past that, it's all wide open.
 You'll get to the island without any trouble.
 That's not the hard point.
 The hard point is right here.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I listened to him, really listened to him, and it went straight to the heart.
 'Even if it kills you, don't retreat at this point.
 Here at the beginning is the hardest part — where the mind advances and
 regresses.
 This part is so hard that you'll want to go smash your head against that
 mountain over there out of frustration.
 The mind advances and regresses, over and over again.
 Once you get past this point, though, you'll make progress easily, without
 any obstacles at all.
 That's all there is to it.
 Give it your best at the beginning and don't retreat.
 Understand?' That's what he said.
 'If you retreat here, you won't get anywhere.
 So give it your life.
 Strike your way through right here.
 After all, your vision says you can make it.
 No matter how difficult it gets, you can make it.
 So don't retreat.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remembered his words and took them to heart — happy and pleased.
 I kept practicing until that following April in line with what he had said.
 The mind had regressed ever since December the previous year until December
 of that year and then on into April.
 It still hadn't advanced.
 It would advance to full strength and then deteriorate, again and again,
 for a year.
 It wasn't until April that I found a new approach, focusing on my meditation
 theme in a new way so that it was really solid.
 From that point on I was able to sit in meditation all night long.
 The mind was able to settle down in full measure, which is why I accelerated
 my efforts from then on.
 Speaking of the difficulty, that's how difficult it really was for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From there on in, the mind was centered and never regressed.
 The way it had regressed before was an excellent teacher.
 I'd absolutely refuse to let it regress again: That was how I felt.
 If it regressed again, I'd die.
 I couldn't stand to stay in the world bearing the mass of suffering that
 would come if it regressed again, because I had already been through it
 once — more than a year of the most acute suffering.
 There's no suffering that burns more than the suffering that comes when
 the mind regresses.
 If it were to regress again, it'd kill me, which was why I was really meticulou
s in keeping watch over myself from then on.
 I wouldn't let the mind regress, and so it kept on progressing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time I saw the marvelousness of the mind was when I began sitting
 in meditation all night — right from the very first night.
 I was investigating pain, and was it ever severe! At first I hadn't planned
 on sitting until dawn, you know.
 I was simply sitting along, and the pain began to grow.
 No matter how I contemplated it, I didn't get anywhere at all.
 'Eh.
 What is this? Okay, if I'm going to die today, let me die.' So I made resolution
 in that moment: 'From this moment on, I won't get up until dawn.
 So.
 If I survive, so be it.
 If not, so be it.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I struck right into the pain, to the point where the mind, which had never
 examined anything in that way...
 Discernment had never moved into action that way, you know, but when it
 was really cornered, at the end of its rope, discernment stirred itself
 into action, keeping up with events from every angle until it was fully
 alert to the pain, alert to the body, and understood the affairs of the
 mind.
 Each was a separate reality.
 They then split away from one another and disappeared completely, even
 though nothing like that had ever happened to me before.
 The body disappeared from my sense of awareness.
 The pain completely vanished.
 All that was left was an awareness that was simply aware.
 It wasn't the sort of outstanding awareness we might imagine it to be.
 It was just simple awareness, but very subtle, very refined, and very amazing
 in that moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I retreated from that state, I renewed my investigation, but when I
 used the strategies I had used before, I didn't get any results, because
 they were now allusions to the past.
 I had to come up with new strategies to keep up with the events of the
 moment.
 The mind then settled down again.
 That night, it settled down three times, and then dawn came.
 Was I ever amazed at myself!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That morning when I got the chance, I went to tell Venerable Acariya Mun.
 Normally, I'd be very intimidated by him, but that morning I wasn't intimidated
 at all.
 I wanted to tell him the truth, so that he could see the results of my
 being true — how I had practiced so that things had occurred that way.
 I spoke with audacity, even though I had never spoken that way with him
 before.
 I really told it to him straight — crash! bang! — and after he had listened,
 he said, 'That's the way it's got to be.' That's just what he said! He really
 let me have it.
 He explained things to my complete satisfaction.
 It was as if I were a dog: As soon as he praised and spurred me on, this
 stupid dog I was, was all raring to bark and bite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After one or two more days, I sat up in meditation all night again.
 After another two or three more days, I did it again, until the mind was
 thoroughly amazed.
 The affairs of death, you know, disappear when the mind really knows.
 When you separate the elements (dhatu) and khandhas to look at life and
 death, the four elements of earth, water, wind, and fire dissolve down
 into their original properties as earth, water, wind, and fire.
 Space returns to its original property as space.
 The mind that used to fear death becomes even more prominent.
 So what is there to die? When it knows so prominently in this way, how
 can it die? The mind doesn't die.
 So what does it fear? We've been lied to.
 The world of defilements has been lying to us.
 ('Lying,' here, means that defilement has lied to the living beings of
 the world, making them fear death, even though actually nothing dies.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I'd investigate one day, I'd get one approach; another day, I'd get
 another approach, but they were all hard-hitting and amazing.
 The mind was more and more amazing and brave, to the point where I felt,
 'When the time comes to die, what sort of pain do they think they're going
 to bring out to fool me? Every facet of today's pain is complete in every
 way.
 Beyond this, there's simply death.
 I've seen all these pains, understood them all, and dealt with them all.
 So when the time comes to die, what sort of pain are they going to bring
 out to deceive me? There's no way they can deceive me.
 The pain will have to be just this sort of pain.
 As for death, nothing dies.
 So what is there to fear aside from the defilements that lie to us, making
 us fall for their fake tricks and deceits? From this point on, I'll never
 fall for their tricks again.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's the way the mind is when it knows, and it knew clearly right from
 the very first night.
 As for the mental state that had progressed and regressed, up to that first
 night it hadn't regressed.
 Beginning that previous April, it hadn't regressed but it still wasn't
 clear.
 That first night, though, it became clear: 'Oh.
 This is how it's supposed to be, the mind that doesn't regress.' It was
 as if it had been climbing up and falling down, climbing up and falling
 down, until finally it climbed up and grabbed hold tight, 100 per cent
 sure that it wouldn't regress.
 This was why I stepped up my efforts full speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During that Rains Retreat (vassa), I sat up all night in meditation nine
 or ten times, but never two nights in a row.
 Sometimes I'd skip two or three nights, sometimes six or seven.
 I got to the point where I was completely sure about pain — heavy or light,
 big or small.
 I understood how to deal with pain, how to sidestep it, how to cure it
 right in time, without being shaken by it.
 I wasn't even afraid of death, because I had investigated it with the most
 completely adroit strategies.
 Mindfulness and discernment were completely up on death in every way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of effort in the practice, my tenth rains — beginning from the
 April after my ninth rains — was when I made the most all-out effort.
 In all my life, I have never made a more vigorous effort, in terms of the
 body, than I did during my tenth rains.
 The mind went all out, and so did the body.
 From that point on, I kept making progress until the mind was like rock.
 In other words, I was skilled enough in the solidity and stability of my
 concentration that the mind was like a slab of rock.
 It couldn't easily be affected by anything at all — and then I was stuck
 on that concentration for five full years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once I was able to get past that concentration, thanks to the hard-hitting
 Dhamma of Venerable Acariya Mun, I set out to investigate.
 When I began to investigate with discernment, things went quickly and easily
 because my concentration was fully prepared.
 It was as if all the materials for building a house were right at hand,
 but I hadn't yet put them together into a house, and so they were just
 useless pieces of wood.
 My concentration simply stopped at concentration that way.
 When I didn't put it together into mindfulness and discernment, it couldn't
 support anything at all, which is why I had to set out investigating in
 the way with which Venerable Acariya Mun hit me over the head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as he hit me, I set out; and no sooner had I set out than I began
 to know what was what.
 I was able to kill off that defilement, cut this one down, step by step.
 I began to wake up: 'Here I've been lying in concentration as if I were
 dead — for all these months, all these years — and it hasn't accomplished
 a thing!' So now I stepped up my efforts at discernment, making it spin
 day and night without anything to put a brake on it at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, you know, I'm the sort of person who goes to extremes.
 Whatever tack I set out on, that's the only tack I take.
 When I began following the path of discernment, I started criticizing concentra
tion as being like lying down dead.
 Actually, concentration is a means for resting the mind.
 If you practice just right, that's the way it is.
 But instead, I criticized concentration as being like lying down dead.
 'All these years, and it hasn't given rise to discernment.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I stepped up my efforts at discernment, beginning first with the body.
 When I contemplated unattractiveness, it was remarkable, you know.
 Really remarkable.
 The mind, when it contemplated, was adroit and audacious.
 I could perceive right through whatever I looked at — man, woman, no matter
 how young.
 To tell you frankly how really audacious the mind was (and here I have
 to ask the forgiveness of both the men and women involved if it's wrong
 to speak too frankly), it wouldn't have to be a question of old women,
 you know.
 If the gathering was full of young women, I could march right in without
 any sign of lust appearing at all.
 That's how daring the mind was because of its contemplation of unattractiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at a person, there would just be the bones wrapped up in skin, nothing
 but flesh all glaring and red.
 So where could I see any beauty? The power of the unattractiveness was
 really strong.
 No matter whose body I looked at, that's how I'd perceive it.
 So where would there be any beauty to make me feel desire? This was why
 I'd dare march right in...
 really beautiful young women, you know.
 (I'll have to keep asking forgiveness until I've finished with this 'forest
 madness.') I could march right in with no trouble at all when I felt daring
 like this, because I was sure of my strength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this daring wasn't right, in terms of the point at which the mind really
 had its fill of lust, which is why I criticized myself afterwards, after
 the mind had passed this point.
 This daring was a kind of madness, but while I was following the path,
 it was right, because that was how I had to follow it through.
 This is like criticizing food after you've eaten your fill.
 Right or wrong, it's the same sort of thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I contemplated unattractiveness until no physical desire appeared at all.
 It gradually faded away, all on its own, without giving any reason at any
 specific time or place.
 It didn't give me any assurance that lust or passion for the male or female
 body had disappeared at this or that point in time and place, so I had
 to deliberate again.
 I wouldn't go along with this simple fading away on its own.
 That is, my mind wouldn't accept it.
 If lust had been wiped out at any particular point, there should have been
 some sort of indication, so that I could know clearly that it was all gone
 for this or that reason, at this or that moment, this or that place.
 It should have had its moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now the mind had to back up and contemplate to find various approaches
 to remedy the situation.
 If it were really all gone, why hadn't there been a clear indication that
 it had been wiped out at this or that moment? As soon as I saw a person's
 body, I would perceive right through it.
 There would be nothing but flesh and bones in that body.
 It wouldn't be a beautiful woman or a beautiful person or anything, because
 the power of my contemplation of unattractiveness was so strong that I'd
 perceive everyone as a pile of bones.
 What would there be to make the mind feel attraction or desire when it's
 in a state like that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now had to turn around and take a new approach.
 If physical desire had ended without leaving a trace at a particular moment,
 using a particular strategy, why hadn't there been a clear indication?
 I turned around and contemplated another way.
 I brought attractiveness in to force out the unattractiveness — the pile
 of bones — covering it with skin to make it beautiful.
 I had to force the mind, you know.
 Otherwise it would immediately break through to unattractiveness, because
 it was so adept that way.
 I forced the mind to visualize the bones covered with skin so that they'd
 be beautiful, and then had that beautiful body cling right to mine.
 That was how I contemplated.
 I'd do walking meditation visualizing the beauty of that body clinging
 to mine, clinging right to mine as I walked back and forth.
 So.
 How much time would it take? If there was any desire still left, it would
 have to show.
 If not, then let me know that it was gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I practiced this way for four full days without any physical attraction
 or desire appearing at all.
 Even though it was an extremely beautiful body, nothing appeared.
 The image kept trying to change into a pile of bones wrapped in skin, but
 I forced the mind to stay just at the skin level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth night, tears began to flow.
 'I've had enough.
 I give in.' In other words, the mind wasn't feeling any pleasure.
 It said that it had had enough, so I tested it again: 'Enough of what?
 If you admit that there's no more desire, then let me know.
 I won't accept your giving in like this.
 To give in like this is just a ruse.
 I won't go along with it.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kept on contemplating every facet to find which facet would make the mind
 feel desire, to see at which moment the desire would arise, so that I could
 then take whatever might appear and focus on it as the object to be contemplate
d and uprooted.
 The night got later and later, and I kept on focusing in — but I wasn't
 focused on contemplating unattractiveness at that point.
 I was contemplating nothing but attractiveness for those entire four days,
 because I was determined to find an approach to test and learn the truth
 of the situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After about 9 or 10 p.m.
 the night of the fourth day, there was a flickering, as if the mind was
 going to feel lust for that beautiful body that had been clinging to me
 constantly during that period.
 It was a peculiar sort of flickering.
 Mindfulness was alert to it, because mindfulness was there all the time.
 As soon as the flickering appeared, I kept encouraging it.
 'See that flickering? We've caught the criminal who has been in hiding.
 See? So how can it be gone? If it's gone, why does it have to behave like
 this?' I focused in on it.
 That flickering was simply a condition of the mind that appeared only slightly,
 with no effect on the body at all.
 It was inside the mind.
 When I encouraged it, it would flicker again, which proved that it wasn't
 all gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now that it wasn't all gone, what was I supposed to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now had to take a new approach, by alternating my tactics.
 Since this was a path I had never taken before, something I had never known
 before, it was very difficult to proceed.
 As soon as I'd focus on unattractiveness, attractiveness would vanish in
 the flash of an eye.
 It would vanish extremely fast because I was already adept at unattractiveness.
 As soon as I'd focus on unattractiveness, the body would turn immediately
 into a pile of bones, so I would have to focus on attractiveness to make
 it beautiful again.
 I kept changing back and forth between the two this way.
 This took a long time because it was a path I had never trod.
 I didn't understand, so I had to try out different methods until I could
 be sure and settle on one path or another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I finally came to the truth when I was sitting visualizing an image of unattract
iveness right in front of me.
 The mind focused on unattractiveness standing still right there.
 I wouldn't let it move or change in any way.
 I had it stay right there like that.
 If it was an image of bones wrapped in skin or a pile of bones with the
 skin removed, I had it stay right there in front of me.
 The mind stared right at it, with mindfulness focused, waiting to learn
 the truth from that image of unattractiveness, to see what it would do,
 how this pile of unattractiveness would move or change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However I stared at it, that's how it would stay, because of the adeptness
 of the mind.
 If I wouldn't have it destroy the image, it wouldn't destroy it.
 I forced it not to destroy it.
 If I had focused on destroying it, it would have been demolished in an
 instant because of the speed of discernment.
 But I didn't let the mind destroy it.
 I had it stay right there in front of me in order to exercise and experiment
 to find the truth of which I could be certain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I kept focusing in, the image of unattractiveness standing there before
 me was gradually sucked into the mind, absorbed into the mind, so that
 I finally realized that unattractiveness was a matter of the mind itself.
 The state of mind that had fixed on the idea of unattractiveness sucked
 it in — which meant that attractiveness and unattractiveness were simply
 a matter of the mind deceiving itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind then let go in a flash.
 It let go of external unattractiveness.
 It understood now because it had made the break.
 'This is how it's supposed to be.
 It's been simply a matter of the mind painting pictures to deceive itself,
 getting excited over its shadows.
 Those external things aren't passion, aversion, and delusion The mind is
 what has passion, aversion, and delusion.' As soon as the mind knew this
 clearly, it extricated itself from external affairs and came inward.
 As soon as the mind would 'blip' outward, it knew that these inner affairs
 were displaying themselves.
 So now the image of unattractiveness appeared exclusively within the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I then focused and investigated within the mind.
 But now it wasn't a matter of that sort of passion.
 It was something very different.
 The affairs of worldly passion now were all gone.
 The mind understood clearly that things had to make the break that way.
 It had passed its verdict.
 It had understood.
 So now that there was the image appearing within, the mind focused within.
 As soon as it focused within, it knew clearly that this internal image
 came from the mind.
 When it disappeared, it disappeared here and didn't go anywhere else.
 The instant after I'd focus on making it appear, it would vanish.
 Before I had focused on it for long, it would vanish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that, it was just like a lightning flash: As soon as I focused on
 making an image, it would vanish immediately, so there was no time to elaborate
 on its being attractive or anything at all, because of the speed of the
 arising and disappearing.
 The instant it would appear — blip! — it would vanish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From that point on, there were no more images in the mind.
 The mind became a completely empty mind.
 As for external unattractiveness, that problem had already been taken care
 of.
 I had understood it from the moment it was sucked in toward the mind, and
 the mind had immediately let go of external unattractiveness.
 It let go of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, everything external — because
 the mind was what had been the deceiver.
 Once I understood this point clearly, those other things were no longer
 a problem.
 The mind had understood immediately and let go of external things once
 and for all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the internal images had all disappeared, the mind was empty.
 Completely empty.
 Whatever I focused on was completely empty.
 I'd look at trees, mountains, buildings, and see them simply as shades,
 as shadows.
 The major part — the mind — was empty all through.
 Even when I'd look at my own body, I'd see it simply as a shadow.
 As for the mind itself, it was empty clear through — to the point where
 I exclaimed to myself, 'Is the mind really this empty?' It was empty at
 all times.
 Nothing passed into it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though it was that empty, I would form mental pictures as a way of
 exercising it.
 Whatever image I'd form would be a means of exercising the mind to make
 it even more adept at emptiness, to the point where after a single blip
 it'd be empty — a single blip and it'd be empty.
 The moment anything was formed — blip! — it'd be empty right then.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point — the point where the mind was empty in full measure — this
 awareness was also prominent in full measure.
 It fully comprehended rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara and viññana.
 It fully let go of them on its own, without anything left.
 All that was left was awareness.
 There was a feeling of relatedness and intimacy, a very subtle sensitivity
 for this awareness that is hard to describe in line with its reality.
 There was a feeling of absorption exclusively for this awareness.
 Any other condition that arose would vanish in the same instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kept watch over it.
 Mindfulness and discernment on this level: If this were the time of the
 Buddha, we would call them super-mindfulness and super-discernment, but
 in our day and age we shouldn't reach for those labels.
 It's enough for our purposes to call them automatic mindfulness and discernment.
 That's appropriate enough for them.
 There's no need to call them anything more exalted than that, for this
 doesn't deviate at all from the truth as it exists.
 This is why the mind was prominent, and this prominence made it bright
 all the way through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day I was doing walking meditation on the western side of Wat Doi Dhammached
i.
 I had gone without food for three or four days, and that day was the lunar
 sabbath, so people were coming to the monastery to give alms.
 I went off to do walking meditation from daybreak and came back only when
 it was time to receive alms in front of the main hall.
 When I was standing in contemplation on the meditation path, an uncanny
 feeling of wonder arose, to the point where I exclaimed, 'Why is it that
 this mind is so amazing? Whatever I look at — even the earth on which I'm
 treading and see clearly with my eyes — why is it that the mind, which
 is the major part, is completely empty? There are no trees or mountains
 in the mind.
 It's completely empty, with nothing left.
 There's nothing but emptiness filling the heart.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stood there contemplating for a moment, when a kind of realization appeared:
 'If there is a point or a center of the knower anywhere, that is the essence
 of a level of being.' That's what it said, and I was bewildered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, the word 'point' referred to that point of the knower.
 If I had understood this problem in terms of the truth that appeared to
 warn me, things would have been able to disband right then and there.
 But instead of understanding, I was bewildered — because it was something
 I had never before known or seen.
 If there was a point, it would be the point of the knower.
 If there was a center, it would mean the center of the knower.
 Where was it? There in that knowing mind.
 That was the essence of a level of being.
 The statement that appeared in the mind already said so clearly.
 There was nothing at all wrong about it, but I was simply bewildered —
 'What is this?' — so for the time being I didn't get any benefit from it
 at all.
 I let more than three months pass by in vain, even though the problem was
 still weighing on the mind.
 I couldn't set it down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the time came for me to know, I was contemplating just the mind — nothing
 wide-ranging or anything — because the mind had already known everything
 on the blatant level.
 Whatever sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations there might
 be throughout the cosmos, the mind had already known, understood and let
 go.
 It wasn't interested in investigating them.
 It wasn't even willing to investigate rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, or
 viññana at all.
 It was interested only in that conspicuous awareness, together with the
 subtle feelings within the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness and discernment kept making contact with that awareness, examining
 it back and forth.
 But you should know that the 'point' I referred to was still a conventional
 reality.
 No matter how magnificent it might be, it was still magnificence in the
 realm of convention.
 No matter how radiant or splendid it might be, it was still radiance and
 splendor in the realm of convention, because there was still unawareness
 (avijja) within it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unawareness forms the essence of conventional reality.
 The point of that prominence eventually began to show its ups and downs
 — in keeping with the very refined level of the mind — so that I was able
 to catch sight of them.
 Sometimes it was a little tarnished, sometimes radiant, sometimes stressful,
 sometimes at ease, in line with the refinement of the mind on this level,
 enough for me to detect its irregularities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mindfulness and discernment on this level were very meticulous guardians
 of this state of mind, you know.
 Instead of aiming my guns — mindfulness and discernment — in on the mind,
 I had aimed them outside, as unawareness had deceived me into doing.
 This is why unawareness is said to be really cunning.
 There is nothing more cunning than unawareness, which is the final point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Greed, for example, is something blatant, easy to understand and plainly
 harmful, and yet world is still content to feel greed.
 Think about it! Anger is also blatant, and yet the world is still content
 to feel anger.
 Infatuation, love, hate: All these things are blatant, easy to understand
 and plainly harmful, and yet the world is still content to feel them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this was not the same sort of thing at all.
 It had gone way beyond.
 It had let go of all those other things, but why was it still attached
 to this radiance, this marvel? Now that it was inside, it would become
 tarnished, just a little.
 It would display stress, just a little — which was a form of change and
 nothing constant or trustworthy — so that I could catch sight of it, using
 mindfulness and discernment that were continually focused there at all
 times without letup, trying to know and see how this state of mind would
 behave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, there was no escaping it: I had to see that this state of mind
 was nothing to be trusted, so I came to reflect, 'Why is it that this state
 of mind can be so changeable? Now it's defiled, now it's radiant, now it's
 easeful, now it's stressful.
 It's not always constant and true.
 Why is it that a mind as refined as this can still show such a variety
 of conditions?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as mindfulness and discernment had turned to take an interest in
 investigating this state of mind, a totally unexpected realization sprang
 up within the mind: 'Defilement, radiance, ease, and stress: These are
 all conventional realities.
 They're all anatta — not-self.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was enough.
 Mindfulness and discernment realized that that state of mind immersed in
 unawareness was a conventional reality that should simply be let go.
 It shouldn't be held to.
 A moment after this realization arose to warn mindfulness and discernment,
 which were acting as the sentinels at that moment, it was as if the mind,
 mindfulness, and discernment each became impartial and impassive, not stirring
 themselves to perform any duty at all.
 At that moment the mind was neutral, not focused on anything, not alluding
 absentmindedly to anything anywhere.
 Discernment didn't do any work.
 Mindfulness was alert in its normal way, without being focused on anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That moment — when the mind, mindfulness, and discernment were each impassiveand
 impartial — was the moment when the cosmos in the mind over which unawareness
 held sway trembled and quaked.
 Unawareness was thrown down from its throne on the heart.
 In its place, the pure mind appeared at the same moment that unawareness
 was toppled, smashed, and eradicated through the power of triumphant mindfulnes
s and discernment — the moment when the sky came crashing down and the cosmos
 (within) trembled and quaked, showing its final marvel on the border between
 convention and release.
 Judgment was passed in the court of justice, with knowledge and vision
 of release acting as judge.
 The middle way, the truth of the path, was declared absolute winner, while
 the truth of the origin of stress was knocked out and carried off on a
 stretcher, with no way of reviving ever again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was utterly astounded and exclaimed, 'Isn't it amazing? Isn't it amazing?
 Where has this Dhamma been hiding? How is it that the genuine Dhamma, this
 amazing Dhamma, exceeding all expectations — exceeding all the world —
 has now appeared in the mind and is one with the mind? And before where
 were the Buddha and Noble Sangha? How is it that these tremendously amazing
 refuges have now become one with the heart? Is this what the true Buddha,
 Dhamma, and Sangha are like?' They didn't fit in with any guesses or speculatio
ns at all, but were simply a pure truth dwelling with a pure truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I reflected with discouragement back on my fellow living beings with
 regard to the Dhamma that was in my heart: 'Since this is what the genuine
 Dhamma is like, how could it be brought out and taught so that others would
 know and understand? Wouldn't it be more appropriate to live alone until
 the day the body breaks apart, rather than try to teach anyone?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as I considered this, a kind of realization suddenly appeared to
 me: 'The Lord Buddha knew this amazing Dhamma all by himself but was able
 to become the Teacher of living beings throughout the three levels of the
 cosmos.
 How is it that I have been able to teach myself and yet get discouraged
 at the thought of being able to teach others? The way to teach, the way
 to know isn't hidden or mysterious.' When I realized this, my discouragement
 at the thought of teaching my friends gradually faded away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This event made me think of the first moments after the Buddha's Awakening,
 when he wearied at the thought of taking the excellent Dhamma in his heart
 and teaching it to the world because he felt that it lay beyond the capability
 of other people to realize it.
 Even though he had aspired to be a Teacher, to instruct the world, he felt
 that the Dhamma he had realized was a Dhamma beyond reach, that it would
 be hopeless to encourage the world to accept it and practice so as to know
 it.
 But when he reflected on the path he had followed to Awakening, he realized
 that the Dhamma wasn't beyond reach or beyond hope, that there would be
 infinite benefits for the world if he were to teach the way of the Dhamma
 whose results he had come to see beyond a doubt.
 This was why he made up his mind to teach the world from that point on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason I had felt the same way was because it was a Dhamma I had never
 before seen or known, and it was a Dhamma utterly amazing.
 When I looked solely at the results in the present, without reflecting
 back on the causes — the path I had followed — I felt disheartened and
 abandoned the idea of telling or teaching anyone about this Dhamma.
 But since reflecting back on the path I had followed, I have felt more
 like speaking and acting out the various facets of the Dhamma, in line
 with the various levels of people who have become involved with me, who
 have studied and trained with me ever since, to the point where I have
 become a sham Acariya as decreed by monks, novices and people in general.
 This being the case, I've had to speak, teach, preach, and scold, heavily
 or lightly as events may call for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have to beg the forgiveness of my listeners and readers for speaking in
 an uncouth way to the point of being ugly, but when this scrap of a monk
 was hiding out in the forest and mountains, he suffered mightily while
 training himself by struggling in various ways on the verge of death —
 because of all sorts of sufferings — without anyone to provide him with
 a funeral.
 No one knew or was interested, except for a few of those people in the
 forest and mountains on whom I depended to keep my life going from one
 day to the next, who may have known of some aspects of some of my sufferings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, the statement that the Buddha practiced to the point of
 losing consciousness before gaining Awakening is a truth that those who
 practice wholeheartedly for the sake of the Dhamma, the paths, fruitions,
 and nibbana, have to believe wholeheartedly without any doubt.
 Only those who have never practiced or had any interest in practice, or
 who practice by tying pillows to the backs of their heads and waiting for
 defilement to die, or dig graves for defilement by lying down and waiting
 to rake in the paths, fruitions and nibbana, won't believe in the difficulty
 with which the Buddha and his Noble Disciples practiced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially at present, when people are very clever: Whatever would fly in
 the face of their already being wise and all-knowing, no matter how right
 or good or fantastic that thing might be, they aren't willing to use it
 to take the measure of their own wisdom.
 As a result, their wisdom can't escape creating a lot of foolishness for
 themselves and the common good.
 For this reason, the path leading to depravity for the mind and the path
 leading to Dhamma within the mind are very different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who practice, the Dhamma says, are those who investigate and reflect
 on every facet of the world and the Dhamma without being complacent.
 No matter what posture we are in, no matter where, we should always use
 mindfulness and discernment to look after ourselves.
 We shouldn't be concerned with the deficient or developed manners, the
 good or bad behavior of other people, the points they give us or take away,
 more than we are concerned with our own deficient or developed manners,
 our own good or bad behavior and the points we give or take away from ourselves.
 This is the path of the Dhamma for those who practice the Dhamma, who are
 always embued with Dhamma.
 The opposite way is the low path for those with low minds, with no righteousnes
s infiltrating them at all.
 This is a warning for all those meditators who have come here for training
 to understand and take to heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma I have related today is mostly personal and isn't appropriate
 to be made public to people at large whose sensitivities may vary.
 I myself might be open to criticism, and it might be harmful to the attitudes
 of those who hear or read when the tape is transcribed onto paper — except
 for restricted circles of people who would understand.
 To make this talk public thus goes against the grain with me, but the extent
 to which I have made it public is out of sympathy for those who have come
 for training in all rectitude and who have pleaded with me to make it public
 as an example that those who practice may follow for a long time to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this is wrong in any way, I ask the forgiveness of all my readers.
 It's with the thought that there will be many people endowed with rectitude
 in the practice of meditation, both now and the future, who might get some
 benefit from this outlandish talk, that I put up with the embarrassment
 of having exposed my own stupidity in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unawareness Converges, Concealing The True Dhamma, the True Mind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Dhamma talk was given as an answer to a question posed by one of the
 more important senior monks of our day and age.
 The gist is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was when I began to investigate into the converging point of the cycle
 of defilement — namely, unawareness.
 While I was investigating, I didn't know that I was investigating unawareness.
 I was simply thinking, 'What is this?' There was an uncertainty right there,
 so I focused the mind there, directed my attention to investigate what
 it was, where it came from, where it was going.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It so happened I hit the right spot: I say this because I didn't know that
 it was called, or what unawareness was.
 Actually, unawareness and its name are very different.
 We see its currents spreading out all over the world, but those are only
 its branches.
 It's like trying to catch an outlaw: At first all we can catch are his
 henchmen.
 Whoever we catch is just a henchman.
 We don't know where the chief outlaw is, or what he looks like, because
 we have never seen him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We catch lots of his henchmen, closing in on him, encircling him.
 This is called laying siege to the outlaw.
 Our police force is very large and very strong.
 Each person on the force helps the others, so they have a lot of strength,
 surrounding the spot where the outlaw lies, catching this person, tying
 up that one.
 Ordinarily when they're asked, outlaws won't tell who their chief is.
 Whenever we catch an outlaw, we tie him up until no one is left inside
 our siege line.
 The last person left is the chief outlaw.
 The last person lies in a strategic place, because his henchmen have to
 guard him well on all sides so that no one can easily slip in to see him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The henchmen keep getting captured one after another until we reach the
 cave in which the chief outlaw is hiding, and then we kill everyone in
 there.
 This is when we know clearly that the wily outlaw has been wiped out for
 good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is simply an analogy.
 To put it in other words, the mind's involvement with anything is a branch
 of delusion.
 Regardless of whether the delusion leads in a good or a bad direction,
 it's nothing but an affair of unawareness and the branches of unawareness,
 but actual unawareness itself doesn't lie there.
 So the tactics for investigating it, if we were to use another analogy,
 are like bailing water out of a pond to catch the fish in it.
 If there's a lot of water, we don't know how many fish it contains.
 So we keep bailing out the water until it starts receding lower and lower.
 The fish gather together.
 Each fish, wherever it is, swims down deeper into the water.
 The water keeps getting bailed out, and the fish keep gathering together.
 We can see where each fish is going, because the water keeps receding until
 at last, when the water is dry, the fish have nowhere to hide, and so we
 can catch them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations, together with the
 mental acts that intermingle with them: These are like the water in which
 the fish live.
 To investigate these things is not for the purpose of taking possession
 of them but for the purpose of killing defilement, in the same way that
 a person bails out the water, not because he wants the water but because
 he wants the fish.
 To investigate these things is not for the purpose of taking possession
 of them but for the purpose of knowing them, stage by stage.
 As soon as we know to a certain point, we are no longer concerned with
 that point.
 We know the things with which we are involved, as well as the fact that
 we are the one at fault for being involved, that our own misunderstanding
 is what deludes us into loving and hating these things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, the scope of our investigation keeps narrowing in, narrowing
 in, just as the water keeps receding.
 Whatever elements or khandhas we investigate, they are just like external
 things in general.
 There are no differences.
 On the material side, the elements are the same elements.
 The difference lies in the acts of the mind that display themselves — but
 we aren't yet aware of them, so we go labeling things in line with them,
 which is still one of the branches of unawareness.
 But as our investigation seeps deeper and deeper into the central area,
 the more clearly we see the things that come to be involved with us, the
 more clearly we see the mind as it goes out to become involved each time
 — in the same way that the more the water recedes, the more clearly we
 see the fish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we investigate, the more clearly we see phenomena outside and inside
 the body, as well as our own mental concomitants (cetasika), then the more
 clearly we see the point where the chief culprit lies.
 As our investigation keeps closing in, the mind's focus grows narrower
 and narrower.
 Its concerns grow less and less.
 The currents sent out by the mind grow shorter.
 As soon as it stirs itself to become involved with any object, we investigate
 both that object and the stirring of the mind as it goes out to act.
 We see both aspects.
 We see the causes and results on both sides, namely (1) the side with which
 the mind involves itself, the things with which it is involved; and (2)
 the one who becomes involved.
 Discernment keeps moving in, step by step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it moves in and reaches unawareness itself, meditators for the most
 part — if no teacher has warned them in advance — are bound to hold to
 that as their real self.
 This is because they have investigated and seen all things clearly in the
 heart, so that they are fully wise to those things and have let them go,
 with nothing remaining — but what is it that knows those things? This is
 what they take and cherish.
 This is termed unawareness converging, but it turns into their 'self' without
 their realizing it.
 The mind gets deluded there.
 The term 'unawareness' refers to this very delusion about oneself.
 Delusions about outside things are not matters of actual unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of our delusion about this, because of our delusion about that which
 knows all other things, we forget to investigate and pass judgment on what
 it is — because when the scope of the mind narrows, it gathers itself into
 a point.
 The point of the mind that appears at this stage is a radiant mind, bright,
 cheerful, and bold.
 All happiness seems to be gathered right there.
 What do these things come from? If you were to call them results, I'd have
 to admit that they are results.
 We could say that they're results of the practice — if we aren't deluded
 about this point.
 If we're still deluded, these things are still the origin of stress.
 This is the central point of the origin of stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if we're meditators who are always interested in investigating whatever
 comes our way, we won't overlook this.
 No matter what, we can't help but become interested in investigating this
 point — because we have already investigated and understood all things
 of every sort to the point where the mind won't make contact with them.
 If we take the mind out to investigate anything, it won't make contact,
 because it has already had enough of that thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, every mental act that arises, arises from this point.
 Thoughts that form, form from this point.
 The happiness that appears, appears here.
 The happiness that appears undergoes changes we can see: This is what makes
 us begin investigating again, because this is a level in which we are very
 observant.
 When we observe the happiness, we see that it isn't steady, for the happiness
 produced by unawareness is a conventional reality.
 Sometimes it gets tarnished a little — just a little — enough for us to
 know that it isn't uniform.
 It keeps changing in that way, in line with its status as a refined phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the point that we trust and believe in.
 Even those who practice with intensity and extreme interest will fall for
 this point and become attached to it if no one has explained it to them
 in advance.
 But even though we trust in it, we can't help observing it if we are interested
, because that's all there is that attracts the heart.
 This is what causes us to be attracted to it, to be content with what appears.
 As long as we have been investigating, that's the way it has been — to
 the extent that we don't know what unawareness is — and so we believe that
 this will be nibbana, this point that is bright and clear all the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'All the time' here means all the time for those meditators who are persistent
 in cleansing it and who aren't entirely complacent in their trust for it,
 who are very protective of this point and won't let anything touch it.
 Such people use a great deal of caution.
 As soon as anything touches that point, they will rectify it immediately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they don't know what it is that they love and cherish.
 Even though that love and cherishing is clearly a burden, they don't realize
 the fact at that moment.
 Only when enough time has passed for them to be ready to know will they
 become interested in investigating this point.
 'What is this? We've investigated everything of every sort, but what is
 this?' Now the mind focuses in on that point.
 Discernment probes in.
 'What is this, for sure? Is it true yet or not? Is it awareness or unawareness?
' These doubts keep nagging at the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we keep on investigating and contemplating, using discernment without
 ceasing — because this is something we have never seen, never met with
 before — to see why we love it, why we are protective of it.
 If it's something true, why do we have to love and protect it? Why do we
 have to care for it? To care for something is a burden, in which case this
 must be a hazard for the person who cherishes and cares for it, or something
 that shouldn't be trusted — even though at that moment we still don't know
 what it is, whether it's really unawareness or not, because we have never
 seen how true awareness differs from unawareness, or how release differs
 from conventional reality.
 This is where discernment becomes interested in investigating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, I'd say that this is something very elaborate and involved.
 If I were to describe it in line with how I investigated it, or to condense
 it so as to give the gist in a reasonable amount of time, I'd summarize
 quickly by saying whatever makes an appearance, investigate it.
 Whatever makes an appearance is a matter of conventional reality — I'm
 referring here to the refined phenomena that appear in the heart.
 Ultimately, even that very point with its brightness is the point of genuine
 unawareness.
 Focus down on it, using discernment.
 Just as all phenomena in general are simply phenomena, this nature is also
 simply a phenomenon in exactly the same way.
 We can't latch onto it as being 'us' or 'ours' — but our protectiveness
 shows that we hold to it as being us or ours, which is a mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment probes inward to see just what this is, as if we were to turn
 around to look at ourselves.
 We look outside and see the earth, the sky, the air.
 Whatever passes into our range of vision, we see.
 But if we don't look back at ourselves, we won't see ourselves.
 Discernment at this stage is very quick.
 It looks back and forth, back and forth, to see this last point or this
 last stage, and its investigation is just like its investigation of things
 in general.
 It investigates not to take possession of its object but simply to know
 its object for what it truly is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this disbands, it's not like other things disbanding.
 When other things disband, they go with a feeling that we understand them.
 But this isn't like that.
 When it disbands, it disintegrates in an instant, like a lightning flash.
 There's an instant where it acts of its own accord — or you could say that
 it flips over.
 It flips over and disappears completely.
 When it disappears, that's when we know that it was genuine unawareness
 — because once this has disappeared, nothing more appears for us to doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What remains is nothing like it at all.
 It's a pure nature.
 Even though we have never seen it before, when it appears in that moment,
 there is nothing to doubt — and that's how the burden is all gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 'I' refers to this genuine unawareness.
 It means that this unawareness is still standing.
 Whatever we have been investigating has been for its sake.
 Whatever we say we know, this 'I' is what knows.
 Radiant? 'I'm' radiant.
 Light? 'I'm' light.
 Happy? 'I'm' happy.
 'Me,' 'I,' they refer to this.
 This is genuine unawareness.
 Whatever we do is for its sake.
 Once it disintegrates, there is nothing more for anything's sake.
 It's all gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to make an analogy, it's like a water jar whose bottom has been
 smashed.
 No matter how much water we may pour into it, nothing stays in the jar.
 Everything that may be formed in line with the nature of the khandhas can
 still be formed, but nothing sticks because the vessel — unawareness, the
 chief culprit — has disintegrated.
 As soon as sankharas form — blip! — they vanish.
 They simply pass by, disappearing, disappearing, because there's no place
 to keep them, no one who owns them.
 The nature that realizes that nothing is its owner is a nature that has
 reached itsfullness.
 It is thus a genuinely pure nature and no longer a burden that needs to
 be watched over or protected from danger ever again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This unawareness is what has been concealing the true Dhamma, the true mind,
 all along.
 This is why we haven't seen the true, natural marvelousness of the mind.
 For this reason, meditators who reach the stage of this pitfall latch onto
 it as something marvelous, love it, cherish it, are protective of it, and
 regard it as 'me' or 'mine': 'My mind is radiant.
 My mind is courageous and brave.
 My mind is happy.
 My mind knows everything of every sort' — but this nature doesn't know
 itself, which is why the Buddha called it genuine unawareness.
 Once we turn around and know it, it disintegrates.
 Once it disintegrates, it's just like opening the lid of a pot: Whatever
 is in the pot, we can see it all.
 Only unawareness keeps the mind concealed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This purity is a truth that lies beyond the truths of stress, its origin,
 its cessation and the path.
 It's a truth beyond the four Noble Truths.
 Of the four truths, one pair binds, the other unbinds and stops.
 What do they bind and unbind? They bind the heart, or keep it covered;
 and they unbind the heart, or uncover it.
 They open up the things that cover it so as to reveal its purity in line
 with its truth.
 Its truth is already there, but the two truths of stress and its origin
 keep it concealed, just as the lid of a pot conceals whatever is in the
 pot so that we can't see it.
 The path — the practice — opens it.
 The path and the cessation of stress open the pot so that we can see clearly
 what's inside.
 Even though the purity is already there, it's concealed by the first two
 truths and revealed by the truths that unbind.
 This is what is bound, this is what is revealed.
 Once it's revealed, there are no more problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both pairs of truths are activities.
 Both are conventional realities.
 The path and the cessation of stress are conventional realities.
 Once they have performed their duties, they pass.
 Stress and the origin of stress are also conventional realities.
 Once the two conventional realities remedy the two conventional realities,
 that pure nature is a nature that stays fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we see at that point is called release.
 Things are opened so that we see release, or natural purity.
 The burden of the task is ended right here.
 When the mind is pure, it doesn't confer any titles on itself.
 As for external things, the worldly phenomena (loka-dhamma) connected with
 external things, they're far away.
 The worldly phenomena that we used to say were good or bad, pleasant or
 painful in the heart, are no longer a problem once that point has disintegrated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we investigate to this level, it's not wide-ranging.
 If we can derive an approach from the explanations given by a meditation
 master who has known and passed this stage, we can make quick progress
 — but it's important that we not set up any expectations.
 Expectations are not the path.
 Whatever appears, keep investigating and understanding that point — each
 successive thing as it appears.
 That's the correct path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'Unawareness' refers to the nature I have just explained.
 That's genuine unawareness.
 All other things are just its branches.
 Like a vine whose stem grows in one place but that creeps to who-knows-where:
 No matter how long it is, it keeps creeping and climbing.
 When we catch hold of it, we follow it in, follow it in, until we reach
 its stem.
 Here's the stem.
 Here's the root.
 Once we pull up the root, the whole thing dies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same way, the branches of unawareness are many and long, so that
 when we actually reach unawareness, we don't know what it is.
 But we investigate it.
 Discernment probes on in.
 Even though we don't know that this is unawareness, our investigation is
 on the right path, and so unawareness opens up of its own accord, in the
 same way as when we eat: Fullness appears clearly for us to see step by
 step all on its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So to summarize the issue of whether unawareness is a factor of rebirth
 or a factor of kamma: It creates levels of being, it creates kamma relentlessly.
 These are both matters of the same cycle.
 It keeps creating levels of being within itself.
 The mind can't lie still.
 It simply keeps creating being and birth all the time.
 It works at accumulating these things for itself, but for the most part
 it accumulates things that weigh it down constantly, making it sink to
 lower levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When people talk about destroying the wheel of kamma, this unawareness is
 what's destroyed.
 Once this is destroyed, there are no more connections to create further
 levels of being and birth.
 Even though the things that used to be involved with us continue to become
 involved as they normally did, they pass by.
 They don't seep in.
 They don't set up house and move into this spot the way they used to.
 They simply pass by.
 And we know that this pure nature doesn't connect with anything.
 We have seen the connections of the mind, step by step, and when we reach
 the level where it doesn't connect with anything, we know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for knowing the question of levels of being and birth, as to whether
 or not we'll be reborn, there is no need to speculate, because the present
 already tells us clearly that when there are no connections to levels of
 being and birth inside us, as we plainly see, there are no levels of being
 or birth to continue into the future.
 The factory has been destroyed, and there is no way it can rebuild itself.
 There is no way it can produce issues as it used to.
 The factory that produced suffering has been destroyed once and for all.

The phrase 'khandhas pure and simple' refers to this stage.
 The khandhas are khandhas pure and simple, without any defilements.
 If the mind isn't defiled, the khandhas aren't defiled.
 They are simply tools.
 If the central part — the mind — is defiled, each khandha follows it in
 being defiled.
 The body becomes a means for increasing defilement in the heart.
 Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana all become means for increasing defilement
 in the heart.
 If the mind is pure, the khandhas for their part are also pure.
 Nothing is defiled.
 But if the mind is defiled, the khandhas are defiled all the livelong day.
 This is the way the truth is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The creation of being and birth is a matter of the mind that keeps producing
 itself.
 It can't stay still.
 A mind that has the cycle in charge of its work or supervising its work
 will have to keep itself spinning all the time.
 Whatever thoughts it spins are for the sake of creating being and birth.
 As soon as the cycle disintegrates, there is nothing to create being and
 birth any more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those whose minds have attained realization exclaim spontaneously in the
 heart to proclaim the Dhamma unabashedly to the world, saying that there
 are no more levels of being in which they
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
are to be reborn — as when the Buddha exclaimed, 'aneka-jati-samsaram...'3
 because he knew right in the present that there was nothing creating itself.
 Goodness stayed in its own territory and didn't seep in, didn't mingle.
 Evil stayed in its own territory and didn't seep in or mingle.
 They didn't come running in.
 When we say that they didn't come running in, it's not that he forced them
 not to.
 It was simply their own nature.
 When these things come running in we don't force them to.
 There's simply a medium along which they run.
 When there's no more medium, they disconnect of their own accord.

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed to me when I was investigating this — when unawareness disappeared
 — that there was a moment that let me know very clearly.
 It was a moment — an instant I hadn't anticipated or expected.
 It was an instant that grabbed my attention.
 The instant unawareness disappeared was an instant in which it displayed
 itself, as if it flipped itself over into a new world (if you were to call
 it a world).
 It flipped in the flash of an eye and vanished in the same instant, although
 this wasn't anything I had anticipated.
 I hadn't intended for it to flip.
 It happened of its own accord.
 This is something very subtle that is impossible for me to describe correctly
 in line with the truth of that instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practicing the religion, if we practice it really to gain release from
 suffering, there are two intricate points.
 To separate the attachments between the mind and the body: This is one
 intricate point; and then this second intricate point that was the final
 point of my ability.
 Other than that there's nothing devious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once, when I went to practice at Wat Doi Dhammachedi, the problem of unawareness
 had me bewildered for quite some time.
 At that stage the mind was so radiant that I came to marvel at its radiance.
 Everything of every sort that could make me marvel seemed to have gathered
 there in the mind, to the point where I began to marvel at myself, 'Why
 is it that my mind is so marvelous?' Looking at the body, I couldn't see
 it at all.
 It was all space — empty.
 The mind was radiant in full force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But luckily, as soon as I began to marvel at myself to the point of exclaiming
 deludedly in the heart without being conscious of it — if we speak on the
 level of refined Dhamma, it was a kind of delusion; it was amazed at itself,
 'Why has my mind come so far?' — at that moment, a statement of Dhamma
 spontaneously arose.
 This too I hadn't anticipated.
 It suddenly appeared, as if someone were speaking in the heart, although
 there was no one there speaking.
 It simply appeared as a statement: 'If there is a point or a center of
 the knower anywhere, that is the essence of a level of being.' That's what
 it said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That phenomenon actually was a point: the point of knowledge, the point
 of radiance.
 It really was a point, just as the statement had said.
 But I didn't take into consideration what the 'point' was and so I was
 bewildered.
 Instead of gaining an approach from the warning that had appeared, I took
 the problem to chew over until I came to consider the part about the 'point.'
 That was what ended the problem.
 I then came back to understand clearly the matter of, 'If there is a point
 or a center of the knower anywhere, that is the essence of a level of being.'
 That was when I understood, 'Oh — I see.
 The words "point" and "center" refer to just this.' Before, I hadn't understood.
 It really was a point.
 No matter how marvelous, it was the point of the marvelousness.
 It was a point there to be known.
 Once that disintegrated, there were no more points, because every point
 is a conventional reality.
 No matter how refined, each is a conventional reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why I am always teaching my fellow meditators: 'Once you've reached
 that point, don't be protective of anything.
 Investigate on in.
 Even if the mind should actually be demolished by that investigation, let
 it be demolished.
 Whatever is left to be aware of the purity, let it be aware — or if everything
 is going to be demolished so that there is nothing left to be aware of
 purity, then at least find out.
 Don't be protective of anything at all.' I say this out of fear that they'll
 be protective of this thing.
 If they aren't warned that forcefully, then no matter what, they're bound
 to get stuck.
 All I ask is that they find out: 'Whatever is going to vanish, let it vanish.
 Even if the mind is going to vanish from the power of the investigation,
 let it vanish.
 There's no need to protect it.' When investigating, you have to take it
 that far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there's no escaping the truth: Whatever arises has to vanish; whatever
 is true, whatever is a natural principle in and of itself, won't vanish.
 In other words, the pure mind won't vanish.
 Everything of every sort may vanish, but that which knows their vanishing
 doesn't vanish.
 This vanishes, that vanishes, but the one that knows their vanishing doesn't
 vanish.
 Whether or not we try to leave it untouched, it keeps on knowing.
 But to try to protect it is tantamount to protecting unawareness, because
 unawareness is subtle.
 It's there in the mind.
 To be protective of the mind is tantamount to being protective of unawareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then.
 If the mind is going to be destroyed along with it, let it be destroyed.
 To make a comparison with slashing, slash right on down.
 Don't let there be anything left.
 Let everything in there close up shop and leave.
 To take it that far is just right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're hesitant, then you are sure to get stuck at this level.
 That's why you can't let yourself be hesitant.
 You have to take the defilements all out.
 Whatever is going to vanish, let it all vanish.
 As for that which is in no position to vanish, it won't vanish no matter
 what.
 To put it simply, it's as if bandits had gotten into this house.
 If you're protective of the house where the bandits are, then — Bang! —
 they'll shoot you dead.
 So if you should burn the whole house down, then burn it down.
 If you let the bandits stay there, they'll go on to destroy things that
 have more value than the house.
 So be willing to sacrifice the house.
 Set fire to it.
 This is called setting fire to unawareness.
 If the mind is really going to vanish, let it vanish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But actually the mind doesn't vanish.
 Only when you have burned that thing will you know: 'Oh — the thing of
 value has been lying beneath the power of unawareness.
 Unawareness has had it covered.' The instant unawareness vanishes, this
 other thing is revealed.
 Instead of vanishing too, it doesn't vanish, but if you're protective of
 it you'll be stuck and will never get free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The period when I was investigating this point was after Venerable Acariya
 Mun had passed away.
 I really felt at the end of my rope.
 I couldn't stay with my fellow meditators.
 I couldn't stay with anyone at all.
 They'd get in the way.
 They'd spoil the fun of my internal efforts at investigation — because
 at that time the mind was really spinning.
 It had reached the level where it would spin and spin without stopping.
 At the time, I called it 'spinning as a wheel of Dhamma (dhamma-cakka),
 not as a wheel of rebirth (vatta-cakka).' It spun to release itself.
 It spun all the time.
 And as soon as it fully reached a state of enough, it stopped — completely
 and unexpectedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a while, at first, I had been getting annoyed.
 'The more I've investigated this mind — and the more refined it has become
 — why has the burden, instead of growing lighter, become so heavy like
 this? And it doesn't have any sense of day or night — why is it?' I was
 getting a little concerned and annoyed.
 But even though I was annoyed, the mind didn't let up.
 It kept spinning there, right before my eyes.
 It kept spinning, scratching, and digging, looking for things that I hadn't
 yet known or seen.
 Wherever I was caught up at any point, it would keep digging and scratching
 its way away.
 As soon as it made contact, it would immediately latch on and stick with
 it.
 As soon as it understood, the matter would pass and disappear.
 The mind would then continue probing.
 Had Venerable Acariya Mun been alive at that point, things would have gone
 more quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why I have taught my fellow meditators that I'll give them my all.
 If I can't solve their problems, I'll take them to a teacher who can.
 Those are the lengths I'll go to — so that my fellow meditators can put
 their minds to rest.
 And for this reason, I'm not willing to have some of my talks recorded,
 because I let everything out.
 As soon as I've finished, the sound vanishes.
 I talk just for those who are there.
 People who didn't understand those matters would think I was bragging.
 Actually, I speak in line with the truth and to encourage my students:
 'It has to be like this.
 You have to slash into it like this.' That's just how I put it.
 It's as if I give myself as a guarantee so that my students can be confident
 that what I say isn't wrong and so that they'll feel inspired to apply
 themselves to the effort with strength and resilience.
 Other people, though, who didn't understand my motives or anything, would
 think I was bragging.
 Instead of benefiting, they'd be harmed.
 Even if I weren't harmed, they might be, so I have to be careful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, on some occasions and with some people where I should really
 pull out all the stops, that's what I do.
 Otherwise I can't put my mind to rest about them.
 We really have to give and take.
 It's as if we both open up and give it our all to the point where we keep
 nothing back, not even a cent.
 This is the way it sometimes is, on some occasions, but not always.
 It depends on the situation, how far we should go.
 If we go that far, then if other people listened in, they'd think we were
 crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I myself, when listening to Venerable Acariya Mun talk: If he'd take it
 that far, it'd go straight to the heart.
 For three days afterwards I would feel as if the leaves on the trees weren't
 moving.
 The atmosphere would seem absolutely still.
 The power of his Dhamma blanketed everything — because the people listening
 were really intent on listening, the person speaking was really intent
 on speaking, and so they reached each other.
 As for us, even when we're told, 'This.
 This.
 It's like this,' we still don't see.
 It's like pointing out things to the blind — pitiful, when you think about
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, wherever I am, if I haven't bowed down to Venerable Acariya
 Mun, I can't lie down to sleep, no matter where I am.
 Even if I'm about to do walking meditation, I first face in his direction
 and pay him homage.
 If there's a picture of him as a conventional focus, I pay homage to his
 picture.
 If there's nothing, I take his virtues and form them into a convention
 to which I pay respect.
 His virtues will never fade for me.
 It's as if he hadn't passed away: a nature that stays like that, as if
 he were watching me all the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why all the Noble Disciples who have seen the principles of the
 truth of the Lord Buddha with their full hearts submit to him.
 That is, they submit to the principles of the truth that are principles
 of nature; they don't submit to his person or anything like that.
 They submit in that the principles of the truth are now the same for them
 and will never fade.
 No matter how far they may be from him, that truth will never fade, because
 the truth is the same for all of them.
 Even though the Buddha may have entered total nibbana more than 2,500 years
 ago, this is not a problem that has an impact on the truth appearing in
 our hearts.
 It's simply the passage of conventional time or of the body — that's all
 — but the principle of that truth is unmoving: always one who is pure.
 Whether alive or totally nibbana-ed, it's one who is pure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a truth that is fixed.
 Those who know this principle of the truth all trust it in the same way,
 because the true Buddha, the true Dhamma, and the true Sangha lie in the
 heart.
 The heart truly pure is the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha in full
 measure, untouched and undisturbed by time or place, unlike conventional
 realities in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Conventional Mind, The Mind Released
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the mind has been well-cleansed so that it's constantly radiant, then
 when we're in a quiet place, without any sounds — for instance, late in
 the still of the night — even if the mind hasn't gathered in concentration,
 we find that when we focus on that center of awareness, it is so exceedingly
 delicate and refined that it's hard to describe.
 This refinement then becomes like a radiance that spreads all around us
 in every direction.
 Nothing appears to be making contact with the senses of sight, hearing,
 smell, taste, and feeling at that moment, even though the mind hasn't gathered
 into the factors of concentration.
 Instead, this is the firm foundation of the mind that has been well-cleansed
 and displays a striking awareness, magnificence, and sensitivity within
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this type of awareness, it's as if we weren't dwelling in a body at
 all.
 This is a very refined awareness, pronounced within itself.
 Even though the mind hasn't gathered in concentration, still — because
 of the refinement of the mind, because of the pronounced nature of the
 mind — it becomes a pronounced awareness, without any visions or images
 appearing at all.
 This awareness is preeminent exclusively in itself.
 This is one stage of the mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another stage is when this well-cleansed mind gathers into stillness, not
 thinking, not forming any thoughts at all.
 It rests from its activity — its rippling.
 All thought-formations within the mind rest completely.
 All that remains is simple awareness — which is called the mind entering
 into stillness.
 Here even more so, nothing appears at all.
 All that appears is awareness, as if it were blanketing the entire cosmos
 — because the currents of the mind aren't like the currents of light.
 The currents of light have their end, near or far, depending on the strength
 of the light.
 For example, with electric light, if the candle power is high, it will
 shine for a long distance.
 If low, it will shine for a short distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the currents of the mind aren't like that.
 They have no 'near' or 'far.' To put it simply, there is no time or place.
 The mind can blanket everything.
 Far is like near.
 'Near,' 'far': They don't really apply.
 All that appears is that awareness blanketing everything to the ends of
 the universe.
 It's as if all that appears in the entire world is this single awareness,
 as if there were nothing in our consciousness at all, even though everything
 still exists as it always has.
 This is what it's like: the power of the mind, the current of the mind
 that has been cleansed of things that cloud and obscure it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more so when the mind is completely pure: This is even harder to describe.
 I wouldn't know how to label it, because it's not something to be labeled.
 It's not something that can be expressed like conventional things in general,
 because it's not a conventional reality.
 It lies solely within the range of those who are non-conventional, who
 know their own non-conventionality.
 For this reason, it can't be described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, the world is full of conventions.
 Whatever we say, we need to use a conventional picture, a supposition,
 to make comparisons in every case.
 'It seems like this.
 It seems like that.' Or, 'It's like this.
 It's like that.
 It's similar to that.' For example, take the word, 'nibbana.' Ordinary defilement
 — our ordinary mind — requires that we think of nibbana as broad and spacious,
 with nothing appearing in it.
 But we forget that the word nibbana, which is a conventional word, still
 has some conventionality to it.
 We might even think that there's nothing in nibbana but pure people milling
 around — both men and women, because they both can reach purity: Nibbana
 has nothing but those who are pure, milling around to and fro, or sitting
 around in comfort and peace without being disturbed by sadness, discontent,
 or loneliness as we are in our conventional world so full of turmoil and
 stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, we don't realize that this picture — of pure men and women milling
 or sitting around happily at their leisure without anything disturbing
 them — is simply a convention that can't have anything to do with the release
 of actual nibbana at all.
 When we talk about things that are beyond the range of convention — even
 though they may not be beyond the range of the speaker's awareness, even
 though they may be well within that person's range — they can't be expressed
 in conventional terms.
 Whatever is expressed is bound to be interpreted wrongly, because ordinarily
 the mind is always ready to be wrong, or continues to be wrong within itself.
 As soon as anything comes flashing out, we have to speculate and guess
 in line with our incorrect and uncertain understanding — like Ven.
 Yamaka saying to Ven.
 Sariputta that an arahant no longer exists after death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ven.
 Yamaka was still an ordinary, run-of-the-mill person, but even though Ven.
 Sariputta, who was an arahant, tried to explain things to him, he still
 wouldn't understand, until the Lord Buddha had to come and explain things
 himself.
 Even then — if I'm not mistaken — Ven.
 Yamaka still didn't understand in line with the truth the Buddha explained
 to him.
 As I remember, the texts say that Ven.
 Yamaka didn't attain any of the paths and fruitions or nibbana or anything.
 Still, there must have been a reason for the Buddha's explanation.
 If there were nothing to be gained by teaching, the Buddha wouldn't teach.
 In some cases, even when the person being taught didn't benefit much from
 the Dhamma, other people involved would.
 This is one of the traits of the Lord Buddha.
 There had to be a reason for everything he'd say.
 If there was something that would benefit his listeners, he'd speak.
 If not, he wouldn't.
 This is the nature of the Buddha: fully reasonable, fully accomplished
 in everything of every sort.
 He wouldn't make empty pronouncements in the way of the rest of the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when he spoke to Ven.
 Yamaka, I'm afraid I've forgotten the details 4 — because it's been so
 long since I read it — to the point where I've forgotten who benefited
 on that occasion, or maybe Ven.
 Yamaka did benefit.
 I'm not really sure.
 At any rate, let's focus on the statement, 'An arahant doesn't exist after
 death,' as the important point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha asked, 'Is the arahant his body, so that when he dies he is annihilat
ed with the body? Is he vedana? Sañña? Sankhara? Viññana? Is he earth, water,
 wind, or fire, so that when he dies he's annihilated with these things?'
 He kept asking in this way, until he reached the conclusion that the body
 is inconstant and so disbands.
 Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana are inconstant and so disband.
 Whatever is a matter of convention follows these conventional ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But whatever is a matter of release — of purity — cannot be made to follow
 those ways, because it is not the same sort of thing.
 To take release or a released mind and confuse or compound it with the
 five khandhas, which are an affair of conventional reality, is wrong.
 It can't be done.
 The five khandhas are one level of conventional reality; the ordinary mind
 is also a level of conventional reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The refinement of the mind — so refined that it is marvelous even when there
 are still things entangling it — displays its marvelousness in line with
 its level for us to see clearly.
 Even more so when the things entangling it are entirely gone, the mind
 becomes Dhamma.
 The Dhamma is the mind.
 The mind is Dhamma.
 The entire Dhamma is the entire mind.
 The entire mind is the entire Dhamma.
 At this point, no conventions can be supposed, because the mind is pure
 Dhamma.
 Even though such people may still be alive, directing their khandhas, that
 nature stays that way in full measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their khandhas are khandhas just like ours.
 Their appearance, manners, and traits appear in line with their characteristics
, in line with the affairs of conventional reality that appear in those
 ways, which is why these things cannot be mixed together to become one
 with that nature.
 When the mind is released, the nature of release is one thing; the world
 of the khandhas is another world entirely.
 Even though the pure heart may dwell in the midst of the world of the khandhas,
 it is still always a mind released.
 To call it a transcendent mind wouldn't be wrong, because it lies above
 conventional reality — above the elements and khandhas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transcendent Dhamma is a Dhamma above the world.
 This is why people of this sort can know the issue of connection in the
 mind.
 Once the mind is cleansed stage by stage, they can see its beginning points
 and end points.
 They can see the mind's behavior, the direction towards which it tends
 most heavily, and whether there is anything left that involves the mind
 or acts as a means of connection.
 These things they know, and they know them clearly.
 When they know clearly, they find a way to cut, to remove from the mind
 the things that lead to connection, step by step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the defilements come thick and fast, there is total darkness in the
 mind.
 When this happens, we don't know what the mind is or what the things entangling
 it are, and so we assume them to be one and the same.
 The things that come to entangle the mind, and the mind itself, become
 mixed into one, so there's no way to know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But once the mind is cleansed step by step, we come to know in stages until
 we can know clearly exactly how much there is still remaining in the mind.
 Even if there's just a bit, we know there's a bit, because the act of connectio
n lets us see plainly that, 'This is the seed that will cause us to be reborn
 in one place or another.' We can tell this clearly within the mind.
 When we know this clearly, we have to try to rectify the situation, using
 the various methods of mindfulness and discernment until that thing is
 cut away from the mind with no more connections.
 The mind will then become an entirely pure mind, with no more means of
 connection or continuation.
 We can see this clearly.
 This is the one who is released.
 This is the one who doesn't die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our Lord Buddha — from having practiced truly, from having truly known in
 line with the principles of the truth, seeing them clearly in the heart
 — spoke truly, acted truly, and knew truly.
 He taught what he had truly known and truly seen — and so how could he
 be wrong? At first, he didn't know how many times he had been born, or
 what various things he had been born as.
 Even concerning the present, he didn't know what his mind was attached
 to or involved with, because he had many, many defilements at that stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But after he had striven and gained Awakening, so that the entire Dhamma
 appeared in his heart, he knew clearly.
 When he knew clearly, he took that truth to proclaim the Dhamma to the
 world and with intuitive insight knew who would be able to comprehend this
 sort of Dhamma quickly, as when he knew that the two hermits and the five
 brethren were already in a position to attain the Dhamma.
 He then went to teach the five brethren and attained the aim he foresaw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All five of them attained the Dhamma stage by stage to the level of arahantship.
 Since the Buddha was teaching the truth to those aiming at the truth with
 their full hearts, they were able to communicate easily.
 They, looking for the truth, and he, teaching the truth, were right for
 each other.
 When he taught in line with the principles of the truth, they were able
 to comprehend quickly and to know step by step following him until they
 penetrated the truth clear through.
 Their defilements, however many or few they had, all dissolved completely
 away.
 The cycle of rebirth was overturned to their complete relief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how it is when a person who truly knows and truly sees explains
 the Dhamma.
 Whether it's an aspect of the Dhamma dealing with the world or with the
 Dhamma itself, what he says is bound to be certain because he has seen
 it directly with his own eyes, heard it with his own ears, touched it with
 his own heart.
 So when he remembers it and teaches it, how can he be wrong? He can't be
 wrong.
 For example, the taste of salt: Once we have known with our tongue that
 it's salty and we speak directly from the saltiness of the salt, how can
 we be wrong? Or the taste of hot peppers: The pepper is hot.
 It touches our tongue and we know, 'This pepper is hot.' When we speak with
 the truth — 'This pepper is hot' — just where can we be wrong?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it is with knowing the Dhamma.
 When we practice to the stage where we should know, we have to know, step
 by step.
 Knowing the Dhamma happens at the same moment as abandoning defilement.
 When defilement dissolves away, the brightness that has been obscured will
 appear in that very instant.
 The truth appears clearly.
 Defilement, which is a truth, we know clearly.
 We then cut it away with the path — mindfulness and discernment — which
 is a principle of the truth, and then we take the truth and teach it so
 that those who are intent on listening will be sure to understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught the Dhamma in 84,000 sections (khandha), but they aren't
 in excess of our five khandhas with the mind in charge, responsible for
 good and evil and for dealing with everything that makes contact.
 Even though there may be as many as 84,000 sections to the Dhamma, they
 were taught in line with the attributes of the mind, of defilement, and
 of the Dhamma itself for the sake of living beings with their differing
 temperaments.
 The Buddha taught extensively — 84,000 sections of the Dhamma — so that
 those of differing temperaments could put them into practice and straighten
 out their defilements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And we should make ourselves realize that those who listen to the Dhamma
 from those who have truly known and truly seen — from the mouth of the
 Buddha, the arahants, or meditation masters — should be able to straighten
 out their defilements and mental effluents at the same time they are listening.
 This is a point that doesn't depend on time or place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the Dhamma comes down to the mind.
 The mind is a highly appropriate vessel for each level of the Dhamma.
 In teaching the Dhamma, what are the things entangling and embroiling the
 mind that are necessary to describe so that those who listen can understand
 and let go? There are elements, khandhas, and the unlimited sights, sounds,
 smells, tastes, and tactile sensations outside us, which make contact with
 the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and heart within us.
 Thus it is necessary to teach both about things outside and about things
 inside, because the mind can become deluded and attached both outside and
 inside.
 It can love and hate both the outside and the inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we teach in line with the causes and effects both inside and out, in
 accordance with the principles of the truth, the mind that contemplates
 or investigates exclusively in line with the principles of truth has to
 know, step by step, and be able to let go.
 Once we know something, we can let it go.
 That puts an end to our problem of having to prove or investigate the matter
 again.
 Whatever we understand is no longer a problem because once we have understood,
 we let go.
 We keep letting go, because our understanding has reached the truth of
 those various things in full measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation of the Dhamma, on the levels in which it should be narrow,
 has to be narrow.
 On the levels in which it should be wide-ranging, it has to be wide-ranging
 in line with the full level of the mind and the Dhamma.
 So when the heart of the meditator should stay in a restricted range, it
 has to be kept in that range.
 For example, in the beginning stages of the training, the mind is filled
 with nothing but cloudiness and confusion at all times and can't find any
 peace or contentment.
 We thus have to force it to stay in a restricted range — for example, with
 the meditation word, 'buddho,' or with the in-and-out breath — so as to
 gain a footing with its meditation theme, so that stillness can form a
 basis or a foundation for the heart, so that it can set itself up for the
 practice that is to follow.
 We first have to teach the mind to withdraw itself from its various preoccupati
ons, using whichever meditation theme it finds appealing, so that it can
 find a place of rest and relaxation through the stillness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have obtained enough stillness from our meditation theme to form
 an opening onto the way, we begin to investigate.
 Discernment and awareness begin to branch out in stages or to widen their
 scope until they have no limit.
 When we reach an appropriate time to rest the mind through the development
 of concentration, we focus on tranquillity using our meditation theme as
 we have done before, without having to pay attention to discernment in
 any way at that moment.
 We set our sights on giving rise to stillness with the meditation theme
 that has previously been coupled with the heart or that we have previously
 practiced for the sake of stillness.
 We focus in on that theme step by step with mindfulness in charge until
 stillness appears, giving peace and contentment.
 This is called resting the mind by developing concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mind withdraws from its resting place, discernment has to unravel
 and investigate things.
 Let it investigate whatever it should at that particular time or stage,
 until it understands the matter.
 When discernment begins to move into action as a result of its being reinforced
 by the strength of concentration, its investigations have to grow more
 and more wide-ranging, step by step.
 This is where discernment is wide-ranging.
 This is where the Dhamma is wide-ranging.
 The more resourceful our discernment, the more its investigations spread
 until it knows the causes and effects of phenomena as they truly are.
 Its doubts then disappear, and it lets go in stages, in line with the levels
 of mindfulness and discernment suited to removing the various kinds of
 defilement step by step from the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind then gradually retreats into a more restricted range, as it sees
 necessary, all on its own without needing to be forced as before — because
 once it has investigated and known in line with the way things really are,
 what is there left to be entangled with? To be concerned about? The extent
 to which it is concerned or troubled is because of its lack of understanding.
 When it understands with the discernment that investigates and unravels
 to see the truth of each particular thing, the mind withdraws and lets
 go of its concerns.
 It goes further and further inward until its scope grows more and more
 restricted — to the elements, the khandhas, and then exclusively to the
 mind itself.
 At this stage, the mind works in a restricted scope because it has cut
 away its burdens in stages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is there in the elements and the khandhas? Analyze them down into their
 parts — body, feelings, sañña, sankhara, and viññana — until you have removed
 your doubts about any one of them.
 For example, when you investigate the body, an understanding of feeling
 automatically follows.
 Or when you investigate feelings, this leads straight to the body, to sañña,
 sankhara, and viññana, which have the same sorts of characteristics — because
 they come from the same current of the mind.
 To put it briefly, the Buddha taught that each of the five khandhas is
 a complete treasury or complete heap of the three characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do they have that's worth holding on to? The physical elements, the
 physical heap, all physical forms, are simply heaps of the elements.
 Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana are all mere mental phenomena.
 They appear — blip, blip, blip — and disappear in an instant.
 What value or substance can you get from them? Discernment penetrates further
 and further in.
 It knows the truth, which goes straight to the heart, and it lets go with
 that straight-to-the-heart knowledge.
 In other words, it lets go straight from the heart.
 When the knowledge goes straight to the heart, it lets go straight from
 the heart.
 Our job narrows in, narrows in, as the work of discernment dictates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the way it is when investigating and knowing the path of the mind
 that involves itself with various preoccupations.
 We come in knowing, we come in letting go step by step, cutting off the
 paths of the tigers that used to roam about looking for food — as in the
 phrase from the Dhamma textbooks: 'Cutting off the paths of the tigers
 that roam about looking for food.' We cut them out from the paths of the
 eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body along which they used to roam, involving
 themselves with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations,
 gathering up poisonous food and bringing it in to burn the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discernment thus has to roam about investigating the body, feelings, sañña,
 sankhara, and viññana by probing inward, probing inward along the paths
 that the tigers and leopards like to follow, so as to cut off the paths
 along which they used to go looking for food.
 The Buddha teaches us to probe inward, cutting off the paths until we have
 the tigers caged.
 In other words, unawareness, which is like a tiger, converges in at the
 one mind.
 All defilements and mental effluents converge in at the one mind.
 They can't go out roaming freely looking for food as they did before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mind of unawareness: You could say that it's like a football, because
 discernment unravels it — stomps on it, kicks it back and forth — until
 it is smashed to bits: until the defilement of unawareness is smashed inside.
 This is the level of the mind where defilement converges, so when discernment
 unravels it, it's just like a football that is stomped and kicked.
 It gets kicked back and forth among the khandhas until it's smashed apart
 by discernment.
 When the conventional mind is smashed apart, the mind released is fully
 revealed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do we say the 'conventional mind' and the 'mind released'? Do they become
 two separate minds? Not at all.
 It's still the same mind.
 When conventional realities — defilements and mental effluents — rule it,
 that's one state of the mind; but when it's washed and wrung out by discernment
 until that state of mind is smashed apart, then the true mind, the true
 Dhamma, which can stand the test, doesn't disappear with it.
 The only things that disappear are the things inconstant, stressful, and
 not-self that had infiltrated the mind — because defilements and mental
 effluents, no matter how refined, are simply conventions: inconstant, stressful
, and not-self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When these things disappear, the true mind, above and beyond convention,
 can then appear to its full extent.
 This is what's called the mind released.
 This is what's called the pure mind, completely cut off from all connections
 and continuations.
 All that remains is simple awareness, utterly pure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can't say at what point in our body this simple awareness is centered.
 Before, it was a prominent point that we could know and see clearly.
 For example, in concentration we knew that it was centered in the middle
 of the chest.
 Our awareness was pronounced right there.
 The stillness was pronounced right there.
 The brightness, the radiance of the mind was pronounced right there.
 We could see it clearly without having to ask anyone.
 All those whose minds have centered into the foundation of concentration
 find that the center of 'what knows' is really pronounced right here in
 the middle of the chest.
 They won't argue that it's in the brain or whatever, as those who have
 never experienced the practice of concentration are always saying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when the mind becomes a pure mind, that center disappears, and so we
 can't say that the mind is above or below or in any particular spot, because
 it's an awareness that is pure, an awareness that is subtle and profound
 above and beyond any and all conventions.
 Even so, we are still veering off into conventions when we say that it's
 'extremely refined,' which doesn't really fit the truth, because of course
 the notion of extreme refinement is a convention.
 We can't say that this awareness lies high or low, or where it has a point
 or a center — because it doesn't have one at all.
 All there is, is awareness with nothing else infiltrating it.
 Even though it's in the midst of the elements and khandhas with which it
 used to be mixed, it's not that way any more.
 It now lies world apart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now can know clearly that the khandhas are khandhas, the mind is the
 mind, the body is the body; vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana are each
 separate khandhas.
 But as for feelings in that mind, they no longer exist, ever since the
 mind gained release from all defilement.
 Therefore the three characteristics, which are convention incarnate, don't
 exist in that mind.
 The mind doesn't partake of feeling, apart from the ultimate ease (paramam
 sukham) that is its own nature — and the ultimate ease here is not a feeling
 of ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Buddha teaches that nibbana is the ultimate ease, the term 'ultimate
 ease' is not a feeling of ease like the feelings or moods of the mind still
 defiled, or the feelings of the body that are constantly appearing as stress
 and ease.
 The ultimate ease is not a feeling like that.
 Those who practice should take this point to heart and practice so as to
 know it for themselves.
 That will be the end of the question, in line with the Dhamma that the
 Buddha says is sanditthiko — to be seen for oneself — and on which he lays
 no exclusive claims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we cannot say that the mind absolutely pure has any feeling.
 This mind has no feeling.
 The term 'ultimate ease' refers to an ease by the very nature of purity,
 and so there can't be anything inconstant, stressful, or not-self found
 infiltrating that ultimate ease at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nibbana is constant.
 The ultimate ease is constant.
 They are one and the same.
 The Buddha says that nibbana is constant, the ultimate ease is constant,
 the ultimate void is constant.
 They're all the same thing — but the void of nibbana lies beyond convention.
 It's not void in the way the world supposes it to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we know clearly, we can describe and analyze anything at all.
 If we don't understand, we can talk from morning till night and be wrong
 from morning till night.
 There is no way we can be right, because the mind isn't right.
 No matter how much we may speak in line with what we understand to be right
 in accordance with the Dhamma, if the mind that is acting isn't right,
 how can we be right? It's as if we were to say, 'Nibbana is the ultimate
 ease; nibbana is the ultimate void,' to the point where the words are always
 in our mouth and in our heart: If the mind is a mind with defilements,
 it can't be right.
 When the mind isn't right, nothing can be right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the mind is right, though, then even when we don't say anything, we're
 right — because that nature is already right.
 Whether or not we speak, we're right.
 Once we reach the level where we're right, there's no wrong.
 This is the marvel that comes from the practice of the religion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha taught only as far as this level and didn't teach anything further.
 It's in every way the end of conventions, the end of formulations, the
 end of defilement, the end of suffering and stress.
 This is why he didn't teach anything further, because this is the point
 at which he fully aimed: the full level of the mind and of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before he totally entered nibbana, his last instructions were, 'Monks, I
 exhort you.
 Formations are constantly arising and ceasing.
 Investigate formations that are arising and disbanding, or arising and
 ceasing, with non-complacency.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was all.
 He closed his mouth and never said anything again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this teaching, which has the rank of a final instruction, how should
 we understand or interpret the word 'formation' (sankhara)? What kind of
 formations does it refer to? We could take it as referring to outer formations
 or inner formations and we wouldn't be wrong.
 But at that moment, we can be fairly certain that those who had come to
 listen to the Buddha's final instructions at the final hour were practicing
 monks with high levels of mental attainment, from arahants on down.
 So I would think that the main point to which the Buddha was referring
 was inner formations that form thoughts in the mind and disrupt the mind
 at all times.
 He taught to investigate the arising and ceasing of these formations with
 non-complacency — in other words, to investigate with mindfulness and discernme
nt at all times.
 These formations cover the cosmos!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could, if we wanted to, analyze the word 'formations' as outer formations
 — trees, mountains, animals, people — but this wouldn't be in keeping with
 the level of the monks gathered there, nor would it be in keeping with
 the occasion: the Buddha's last moments before total nibbana in which he
 gave his exhortation to the Sangha: the ultimate teaching at the final
 hour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His final exhortation dealing with formations, given as he was about to
 enter total nibbana, must thus refer specifically to the most refined formation
s in the heart.
 Once we comprehend these inner formations, how can we help but understand
 their basis — what they arise from.
 We'll have to penetrate into the well-spring of the cycle of rebirth: the
 mind of unawareness.
 This is the way to penetrate to the important point.
 Those who have reached this level have to know this.
 Those who are approaching it in stages, who haven't fully reached it, still
 know this clearly because they are investigating the matter, which is what
 the Buddha's instructions — given in the midst of that important stage
 of events — were all about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, I think, would be in keeping with the occasion in which the Buddha
 spoke.
 Why? Because ordinarily when the mind has investigated to higher and higher
 levels, these inner formations — the various thoughts that form in the
 mind — are very crucial to the investigation because they appear day and
 night, and are at work every moment inside the mind.
 A mind reaching the level where it should investigate inner phenomena must
 thus take these inner formations as the focal point of its investigation.
 This is a matter directly related to the Buddha's final instructions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to overthrow unawareness must follow on an investigation focused
 primarily on inner formations.
 Once we have focused in, focused in, down to the root of defilement and
 have then destroyed it, these formations no longer play any role in giving
 rise to defilement again.
 Their only function is to serve the purposes of the Dhamma.
 We use them to formulate Dhamma for the benefit of the world.
 In teaching Dhamma we have to use thought-formations, and so formations
 of this sort become tools of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have given the khandhas a new ruler, the thought-formations
 which were forced into service by unawareness have now become tools of
 the Dhamma — tools of a pure heart.
 The Buddha used these thought-formations to teach the world, to formulate
 various expressions of the Dhamma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dhamma we have mentioned here doesn't exist solely in the past, in the
 time of the Buddha, or solely in the future in a way that would deny hope
 to whose who practice rightly and properly.
 It lies among our own khandhas and mind, in our body and mind.
 It doesn't lie anywhere else other than in the bodies and minds of human
 beings, women and men.
 The defilements, the path, and purity all lie right here in the heart.
 They don't lie in that time or period way back when, or with that person
 or this.
 They lie with the person who practices, who is using mindfulness and discernmen
t to investigate right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why? Because we are all aiming at the Dhamma.
 We are aiming at the truth, just like the Dhamma, the truth, that the Buddha
 taught then and that always holds to the principle of being 'majjhima'
 — in the center — not leaning toward that time or this, not leaning toward
 that period or this place.
 It's a Dhamma always keeping to an even keel because it lies in the center
 of our elements and khandhas.Majjhima: in the center, or always just right
 for curing defilement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So please practice correctly in line with this Dhamma.
 You will see the results of 'majjhima' — a Dhamma just right, always and
 everywhere — appearing as I have said.
 Nibbana, the ultimate ease, will not in any way lie beyond this knowing
 heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so I'll ask to stop here.

\begin_layout Standard
An excerpt from a letter written by Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa to Mrs.
 Pow Phanga Vathanakul, dated February 26, 1976.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practice of the Dhamma in keeping with the Dhamma that he gave with
 utter compassion unequaled by that of anyone else in the world: This is
 the true homage to the Buddha.
 The seeing of the truth that lies within you, using discernment step by
 step at all times: This is the seeing of the Buddha step by step.
 The seeing of the truth with the full heart using discernment: This is
 the seeing of the Buddha in full.
 The true Buddha, the true Dhamma, lie with the heart.
 To attend to your own heart is to attend to the Buddha.
 To watch over your own heart with mindfulness and discernment is truly
 to see the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The king of death warns and assaults the bodies of the world's living beings
 in line with the principles of his truth.
 You have to greet his warnings and assaults with mindfulness, discernment,
 conviction, and unflagging persistence, and take out your treasures — the
 paths, fruitions, and nibbana — to flaunt in his face, braving death in
 the course of persistent effort.
 You and he, who have regarded each other as enemies for such a long time,
 will then become true friends — neither of you to take advantage of the
 other ever again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The body and the khandhas are things that the world must relinquish in spite
 of its regrets.
 You should relinquish them with mindfulness and discernment before the
 time comes to relinquish them in the way of the world.
 This is the supreme letting-go, second to nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please take this to heart, because it is written straight from the heart.

Glossary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acariya:Teacher; mentor.Anatta:Not-self; ownerless.Aniccam:Inconstant; unsteady;
 impermanent.Arahant:A person whose heart is free of mental effluents (see
 asava) and who is thus not destined for future rebirth.
 An epithet for the Buddha and the highest level of his Noble Disciples.arammana:
Preoccupation; mental object.Asava:Mental effluent, pollutant, or fermentation
 — sensuality, states of being, views, and unawareness.Avijja:Unawareness;
 ignorance; obscured awareness; delusion about the nature of the mind.Ayatana:Sen
se medium.
 The inner sense media are the sense organs — eyes, ears, nose, tongue,
 body, and mind.
 The outer sense media are their respective objects.Brahma:'Great One' —
 an inhabitant of the heavens of form or formlessness.Brahman:Used in the
 Buddha sense, this term is synonymous with arahant.Buddho:Awake; enlightened.
 An epithet for the Buddha.Cetasika:Mental concomitant (see vedana, sañña,
 and sankhara).Dhamma (dharma):Event; phenomenon; the way things are in and
 of themselves; their inherent qualities; the basic principles underlying
 their behavior.
 Also, principles of behavior that human beings ought to follow so as to
 fit in with the right natural order of things; qualities of mind they should
 develop so as to realize the inherent quality of the mind in and of itself.
 By extension, 'Dhamma' is used also to denote any doctrine that teaches
 such things.
 Thus the Dhamma of the Buddha denotes both his teachings and the direct
 experience of nibbana, the quality at which those teachings are aimed.Dhatu:Elem
ent; property, impersonal condition.
 The four physical elements or properties are earth (solidity), water (liquidity
), wind (motion), and fire (heat).
 The six elements include the above four plus space and cognizance.Dukkha(m):Stre
ss; suffering; pain; distress; discontent.Evam:Thus; in this way.
 This term is used in Thailand as a formal closing to a sermon.Kamma (karma):Inte
ntional acts that result in states of being and birth.Kayagata-sati:Mindfulness
 immersed in the body.
 This is a blanket term covering several meditation themes: keeping the
 breath in mind; being mindful of the body's posture; being mindful of one's
 activities; analyzing the body into its parts; analyzing the body into
 its physical properties (see dhatu); contemplating the fact that the body
 is inevitably subject to death and disintegration.Khandha:Heap; group; aggregate.
 Physical and mental components of the personality and of sensory experience
 in general (see rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana).Kilesa:Defilement
 — passion, aversion, and delusion in their various forms, which include
 such things as greed, malevolence, anger, rancor, hypocrisy, arrogance,
 envy, miserliness, dishonesty, boastfulness, obstinacy, violence, pride,
 conceit, intoxication, and complacency.Loka-dhamma:Worldly phenomenon —
 fortune, loss of fortune, status, disgrace, praise, censure, pleasure,
 and pain.Lokuttara:Transcendent; supramundane (see magga, phala, and nibbana).Mag
ga:Path.
 Specifically, the path to the cessation of suffering and stress.
 The four transcendent paths — or rather, one path with four levels of refinemen
t — are the path to stream-entry (entering the stream to nibbana, which
 ensures that one will be reborn at most only seven more times), the path
 to once-returning, the path to non-returning, and the path to arahantship.Mara:T
emptation; mortality personified.Nibbana (nirvana):Liberation; the unbinding
 of the mind from mental effluents, defilements, and the round of rebirth
 (see asava, kilesa, and vatta).
 As this term is used to denote also the extinguishing of fire, it carries
 the connotations of stilling, cooling, and peace.
 (According to the physics taught at the time of the Buddha, a burning fire
 seizes or adheres to its fuel; when extinguished, it is unbound.)Pañña:Discernme
nt; insight; wisdom; intelligence; common sense; ingenuity.Parami:Perfection
 of the character — generosity, virtue, renunciation, discernment, persistence,
 forbearance, truthfulness, determination, good will, and equanimity.Parisa:Follo
wing; assembly.
 The four groups of the Buddha's following are monks, nuns, laymen, and
 laywomen.Patimokkha:The basic code of 227 precepts observed by Buddhist
 monks, chanted every half-month in each assembly of monks numbering four
 or more.Phala:Fruition.
 Specifically, the fruition of any of the four transcendent paths (see magga).Puñ
ña:Merit; worth; the inner sense of well-being that comes from having acted
 rightly or well.Rupa:Body; physical phenomenon; sense datum.Sabhava-dhamma:Phenom
enon; an event, property, or quality as experienced in and of itself.Sallekha-dha
mma:Topics of effacement (effacing defilement) — having few wants, being
 content with what one has, seclusion, uninvolvement in companionship, persisten
ce, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the direct knowing
 and seeing of release.Samadhi:Concentration; the practice of centering the
 mind in a single sensation or preoccupation.Sammati:Conventional reality;
 convention; relative truth; supposition; anything conjured into being by
 the mind.Sanditthiko:Self-evident, visible here and now.Sangha:The community
 of the Buddha's disciples.
 On the conventional level, this refers to the Buddhist monkhood.
 On the ideal level, it refers to those of the Buddha's followers, whether
 lay or ordained, who have attained at least the first of the transcendent
 paths (see magga) culminating in nibbana.Sankhara:Formation.
 This can denote anything formed or fashioned by conditions, or — as one
 of the five khandhas — specifically thought-formations within the mind.Sañña:Lab
el; perception; allusion; act of memory or recognition; interpretation.Sati:Mindf
ulness; alertness; self-collectedness; powers of reference and retention.Satipatt
hana:Foundation of mindfulness; frame of reference — body, feelings, mind,
 and mental events, viewed in and of themselves as they occur.Sa-upadisesa-nibban
a:Nibbana with fuel remaining (the analogy is to an extinguished fire whose
 embers are still glowing) — liberation as experienced in this lifetime
 by an arahant.Sugato:Well-faring; going (or gone) to a good destination.
 An epithet for the Buddha.Tanha:Craving, the cause of stress, which takes
 three forms — craving for sensuality, for being, and for not-being.Tathagata:One
 who has become true.
 A title for the Buddha.Tilakkhana:Three characteristics inherent in all
 conditioned phenomena — being inconstant, stressful, and not-self.Tipitaka
 (tripitaka):The Buddhist Cannon; literally, the three 'baskets' — disciplinary
 rules, discourses, and abstract philosophical treatises.Uposatha:Observance
 day, corresponding to the phases of the moon, on which Buddhist lay people
 gather to listen to the Dhamma and to observe special precepts.
 Monks assemble to hear the Patimokkha on the new-moon and full-moon uposatha
 days.Vassa:Rains Retreat.
 A period from July to October, corresponding roughly to the rainy season,
 in which each monk is required to live settled in a single place and not
 wander freely about.Vatta:The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
 This denotes both the death and rebirth of living beings and the death
 and rebirth of defilement within the mind.Vedana:Feeling — pleasure (ease),
 pain (stress), or neither pleasure nor pain.Vijja:Clear knowledge; genuine
 awareness; science (specifically, the cognitive powers developed through
 the practice of concentration and discernment).Vimutti:Release; freedom
 from the fabrications and conventions of the mind.Vinaya:The disciplinary
 rules of the monastic order.Viññana:Cognizance; consciousness; the act of
 taking note of sense data and ideas as they occur.

\begin_layout Section
Karma and Rebirth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wheel of life, or "samsara", is an ancient symbol that has the same
 meaning in Buddhism and Hinduism.
 It is symbolises the cycle of birth, life, and death.
 When one revolution of the wheel is completed, life begins again with rebirth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is karma?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Karma is a Sanskrit word that literally means "action".
 The word is used to refer to volitional acts as well as the forces that
 arise from these acts.
 The idea of karma had existed in ancient Indian philosophy before the time
 of Siddhartha Gautama, and it became an important element of Buddhist philosoph
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hindu and Buddhist concepts of karma are quite similar, although Hinduism
 makes a further distinction between different types of karma, such as present
 karma, latent karma, and future karma.
 In the understanding of both thought systems, the law of karma describes
 the connection between actions and the resulting forces, as follows: wholesome
 actions lead to wholesome states while unwholesome actions lead to unwholesome
 states, individually as well as collectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ethical dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make this more intelligible, one has to account for (un)wholesome actions
 and (un)wholesome states and their respective meaning in Buddhism.
 The former is outlined in the Noble Eightfold Path.
 Action springs from volition, which springs from intention, which springs
 from thought, and so forth.
 The quality of actions can be described in ethical terms, simply as either
 good or bad, or both good and bad, or indifferent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various grades of ethical qualities; and most people have an intuitive
 understanding that enables them to discern between good and bad, although
 the discerning ability depends on the person's state of mental development.
 A wise person at a high level of mental development can clearly discern
 mental activities and actions in an ethical dimension, while a deluded
 person has difficulties or is even unable to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good and bad vs.
 skilful and unskilful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wherever the three defilements - delusion, greed, and aversion - are present,
 they blur the view and increase the level of confusion in the individual
 or group.
 Consequently, if the defilements are present, there is a low level of skill
 in distinguishing between good and bad actions.
 Thus it makes sense to say that we have skilful (good) and unskilful (bad)
 thoughts, we speak skilful (good) and unskilful (bad) words, and we act
 either in a skilful (good) or in an unskilful (bad) way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddhist Precepts and the Ten Perfections give concrete meaning to good
 and bad and explain skilful and unskilful volitional acts in detail.
 Since everything in Buddhism is interrelated, the Eightfold Path must be
 seen in connection with the Four Noble Truths, the concept of karma, and
 the tenet of rebirth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moral quality of volitional acts determines karma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The law of karma states that there is a connection between the moral quality,
 the level of skill in volitional actions, and the resulting states.
 What we are is determined largely by what we thought, said and did in the
 past, while what we are thinking, saying, and doing now will form our future.
 The karma of past, present, and future events are connected by the law
 of cause and effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, if one generates bad karma by hurting or killing sentient
 beings, one will have to endure the negative consequences of these deeds
 in this or another lifetime.
 Similarly, if one generates good karma by observing the precepts, positive
 consequences will follow inevitably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddhists understand karma as a natural law.
 There is no higher instance, no judgement, no divine intervention, and
 no gods that steer man's destiny, but only the law of karma itself, which
 works on a global time frame.
 Deeds yield consequences either in the next second, in the next hour, day,
 month, year, decade, or even in the next lifetime, or in another distant
 lifetime.
 To illustrate this, consider the following example describing a sequence
 of volitional acts, which yield instant karmic results:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: The arising of volition and karma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An unpleasant sensation occurs.
 A thought arises that the source of the unpleasantness was a person.
 This thought is a delusion; any decisions based upon it will therefore
 be unskilful.
 A thought arises that some past sensations of unpleasantness issued from
 this same person.
 This thought is a further delusion.
 This is followed by a wilful decision to speak words that will produce
 an unpleasant sensation in that which is perceived as a person.
 This decision is an act of hostility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all the events described so far, only this is called karma.
 Words are carefully chosen in the hopes that when heard they will cause
 pain.
 The words are pronounced aloud.
 This is the execution of the decision to be hostile.
 It may also be classed as a kind of karma, although technically it is after-kar
ma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a visual sensation of a furrowed brow and turned down mouth.
 The thought arises that the other person's face is frowning.
 The thought arises that the other person's feelings were hurt.
 There is a fleeting joyful feeling of success in knowing that one has scored
 a damaging verbal blow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually, perhaps much later, there is an unpleasant sensation of regret,
 perhaps taking the form of a sensation of fear that the perceived enemy
 may retaliate, or perhaps taking the form of remorse on having acted impetuousl
y, like an immature child, and hoping that no one will remember this childish
 action.
 This regret or fear is the unpleasant ripening of the karma, the unskilful
 decision to inflict pain through words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rebirth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddhists hold that the retributive process of karma can span more than
 one lifetime.
 Rebirth, or reincarnation, has always been an important tenet in Buddhism;
 and it is often referred to as walking the wheel of life (samsara).
 It is the process of being born over and over again in different times
 and different situations, possibly for many thousand times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as there is delusion, greed, and aversion, and as long as passions
 are not extinguished, we generate karma.
 Because we eventually accumulate unmaterialised karma in this or in a past
 lifetime, there is a next lifetime in which the accumulated karma will
 take form.
 Only when all accumulated karma is realised and the generation of new karma
 is calmed, one can enter the stream that leads to Nirvana.
 This process continues until Nirvana is reached, which signifies the cessation
 of rebirth and, hence, suffering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is notable that this also entails the avoidance of "good karma".
 Once the stream that leads to Nirvana is entered, creating wholesome karma
 is not an object anymore.
 Although wholesome karma leads to entering the stream, it does not necessarily
 lead to Nirvana, only the extinguishment of all karmic forces will lead
 to Nirvana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Non-Self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of rebirth is unfamiliar to most Western people.
 Its philosophical and traditional foundation is found in India, where the
 theory of transmigration of souls had presumably existed long before it
 was written down in the Upanishads around 300 BC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddhist concept is subtly different from the classical Indian understanding
, because it denies the existence of a self.
 In Buddhism, the idea of self is merely an illusion.
 Man wrongly identifies perception, consciousness, mind and body with what
 he calls self.
 In reality there is no abiding entity that could be identified with a self,
 because the states of perception, consciousness, and mind constantly change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The body is mortal and when it dies, consciousness and all mental activities
 cease.
 That is why there is no soul.
 The idea of soul is simply an extension of the self.
 Soul is the immortal version of the self that supposedly survives physical
 death.
 Since we know that consciousness is a function of our nervous system, it
 seems difficult to believe that the conscious self survives death.
 Hence, Buddhists deny the reality of both self and soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of an abiding self is deceptive, because it is derived from unenlighten
ed reasoning.
 The word self simply provides a reference frame for the mind-body phenomena
 of sentient beings.
 We usually identify it with our body and the stream of consciousness induced
 by sense perceptions and thoughts.
 In reality, what we call self is neither abiding nor detached from the
 rest of the world and other beings.
 Buddhists call this the "neither self nor non-self".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is reborn if not the "self"?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the idea of non-self sounds odd, then it must sound even more curious
 that non-self can be reborn.
 There is a seeming contradiction between the canon of rebirth and that
 of the non-self, which even many dedicated Buddhists find difficult to
 understand.
 The contradiction is, however, only on the surface and can be solved if
 one pictures the self as the result of karmic formation.
 This can be put into less abstract words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we imagine the world as an ocean, we are like the ripples on the ocean.
 Formations like ripples and waves occur, because of wind, tides, and other
 kinetic forces.
 In the Buddhist analogy, the universe is in motion due to karmic forces.
 A ripple, a wave, or a billow may seem as an individual entity for a moment,
 creating the illusion that it has a self, but it is gone in the next moment.
 The truth is that all individuals are one.
 A ripple is a temporary phenomenon; it is just water in motion.
 We know that kinetic energy causes wave forms on a body of water and it
 would be ridiculous to say that a single ripple or wave has a self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, in case of beings, the process of coming into life and being
 conditioned in a particular way is caused by karmic forces.
 The up and down of the ocean's waves corresponds with the rotation of the
 wheel of life.
 The sea that surges, falls, and resurges, is the life that is born, dies,
 and is reborn again.
 It is therefore obvious that we should not focus on the temporary phenomenon
 of the wave, but on the force that causes, forms, and drives it.
 Nothing else is said, although in more practical terms, in the Eightfold
 Path.

\begin_layout Standard
The Digha Nikaya, or "Collection of Long Discourses" (Pali digha = "long")
 is the first division of the Sutta Pitaka, and consists of thirty-four
 suttas, grouped into three vaggas, or divisions:

An excellent modern translation of the complete Digha Nikaya is Maurice
 Walshe's The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha
 Nikaya (formerly titled: Thus Have I Heard) (Boston: Wisdom Publications,

 [Thanissaro].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
King Ajatasattu asks the Buddha, "What are the fruits of the contemplative
 life, visible in the here and now?" The Buddha replies by painting a comprehens
ive portrait of the Buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of
 the training with vivid similes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DN 9: Potthapada Sutta — About Potthapada {D i 178} [Thanissaro].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wandering ascetic Potthapada brings to the Buddha a tangle of questions
 concerning the nature of perception.
 The Buddha clears up the matter by reviewing the fundamentals of concentration
 meditation and showing how it can lead to the ultimate cessation of perception.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DN 11: Kevatta (Kevaddha) Sutta — To Kevatta (Kevaddha) {D i 211} [Thanissaro].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly
 beings as a possible basis for faith and belief.
 The Buddha does not deny the reality of such experiences, but he points
 out that — of all possible miracles — the only reliable one is the miracle
 of instruction in the proper training of the mind.
 As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion,
 and so the information they give — especially with regard to the miracle
 of instruction — is not necessarily trustworthy.
 Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed,
 brings about the end of one's own mental defilements.
 The tale that concludes the discourse is one of the finest examples of
 the early Buddhist sense of humor.

\begin_layout Standard
DN 12: Lohicca Sutta — To Lohicca {D i 224} [Thanissaro].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-Buddhist poses some good questions: If Dhamma is something that one
 must realize for oneself, then what is the role of a teacher? Are there
 any teachers who don't deserve some sort of criticism? The Buddha's reply
 includes a sweeping summary of the entire path of practice.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This wide-ranging sutta, the longest one in the Pali canon, describes the
 events leading up to, during, and immediately following the death and final
 release (parinibbana) of the Buddha.
 This colorful narrative contains a wealth of Dhamma teachings, including
 the Buddha's final instructions that defined how Buddhism would be lived
 and practiced long after the Buddha's death — even to this day.
 But this sutta also depicts, in simple language, the poignant human drama
 that unfolds among the Buddha's many devoted followers around the time
 of the death of their beloved teacher.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sakka, the deva-king, asks the Buddha about the sources of conflict, and
 about the path of practice that can bring it to an end.
 This discourse ends with a humorous account about Sakka's frustration in
 trying to learn the Dhamma from other contemplatives.
 It's hard to find a teacher when you're a king.

 Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness) {D ii 290} [Thanissaro].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sutta offers comprehensive practical instructions on the development
 of mindfulness in meditation.
 The Buddha describes how the development of continuous mindfulness of the
 four satipatthana ("foundations of mindfulness" or "frames of reference")
 — mindfulness of the body, of feelings, of the mind, and of mind-objects
 — can lead ultimately to full Awakening.
 [The text of this sutta is identical to that of the Satipatthana Sutta

The Precepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The precepts are a condensed form of Buddhist ethical practice.
 They are often compared with the ten commandments of Christianity, however,
 the precepts are different in two respects: First, they are to be taken
 as recommendations, not commandments.
 This means the individual is encouraged to use his/her own intelligence
 to apply these rules in the best possible way.
 Second, it is the spirit of the precepts -not the text- that counts, hence,
 the guidelines for ethical conduct must be seen in the larger context of
 the Eightfold Path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first five precepts are mandatory for every Buddhist, although the fifth
 precept is often not observed, because it bans the consumption of alcohol.
 Precepts no.
 six to ten are laid out for those in preparation for monastic life and
 for devoted lay people unattached to families.
 The eight precepts put together number eight and nine and omit the tenth.
 Lay people may observe the eight precepts on Buddhist festival days.
 Ordained Theravada monks undertake no less than 227 precepts, which are
 not listed here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I undertake to observe the precept to abstain from ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...harming living beings.

\begin_layout Standard
(adapted from The Word of the Buddha, Niyamatolika, The Buddhist Publication
 Society, 1971, p xii)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above phrasing of the precepts is very concise and leaves much open
 to interpretation.
 One might ask, for example, what exactly constitutes false speech, what
 are untimely meals, what constitutes sexual misconduct, or whether a glass
 of wine causes heedlessness.
 And, the grotesque mime watching of the seventh precept sounds perhaps
 a bit outdated.
 The Buddhist master Thich Nath Hanh has formulated The Five Mindfulness
 Trainings, which are an adaptation of the first five Buddhist precepts.
 These are practised by Buddhists of the Lam Te Dhyana school.
 By virtue of their sensible phrasing and their relevance to modern lifestyle,
 these "trainings" provide a valuable foundation of ethics for all of humanity.

 and to prevent couples and families from being broken by sexual misconduct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
-Fourth Training-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech and the inability to listen
 to others, I am committed to cultivate loving speech and deep listening
 in order to bring joy and happiness to others and relieve others of their
 suffering.
 Knowing that words can create happiness or suffering, I am committed to
 learn to speak truthfully, with words that inspire self-confidence, joy,
 and hope.
 I am determined not to spread news that I do not know to be certain and
 not to criticise or condemn things of which I am not sure.

 joy in my body, in my consciousness, and in the collective body and consciousne
ss of my family and society.
 I am determined not to use alcohol or any other intoxicant or to ingest
 foods or other items that contain toxins, such as certain TV programs,
 magazines, books, films, and conversations.
 I am aware that to damage my body or my consciousness with these poisons
 is to betray my ancestors, my parents, my society, and future generations.
 I will work to transform violence, fear, anger, and confusion in myself
 and in society by practising a diet for myself and for society.
 I understand that a proper diet is crucial for self-transformation and
 for the transformation of society.

 Sariputta, this discourse teaches two lessons in heedfulness.
 (1) If you're engaging in wrong livelihood, don't expect to escape the

\begin_layout Standard
The Buddha refutes a Jain theory of kamma, which claims that one's present
 experience is determined solely by one's actions in past lives, and that
 the only way to undo the effects of past unskillful actions is to "burn
 them away" through severe practices of austerity.
 The Buddha here outlines one of his most important teachings on kamma:
 that it is both the results of past deeds and present actions that shape
 one's experience of the present.
 It is precisely this interaction of present and past that opens up the
 very possibility of Awakening.

 orders after surgery, who knowingly drinks a cup of poison, or who deliberately
 extends a hand toward a deadly snake.

 clinging and so gaining release.
