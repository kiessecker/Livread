<!--l. 46615--><p class="indent" >   Preface
<!--l. 46617--><p class="indent" >   If we contemplate even a minute sector of the vast range of life, we are faced with
such a tremendous variety of life&#8217;s manifestations that it defeats description. And yet
three basic statements can be made that are valid for all animate existence, from the
microbe up to the creative mind of a human genius. These features common to all life
were first found and formulated over 2500 years ago by the Buddha, who
was rightly called "Knower of the Worlds" (loka-vidu). They are the Three
Characteristics (ti-lakkha.na) of all that is conditioned, i.e., dependently
arisen. In English renderings, they are also sometimes called Signs, Signata, or
Marks.
<!--l. 46628--><p class="indent" >   These three basic facts of all existence are:
<!--l. 46630--><p class="indent" >   Impermanence or Change (anicca)
<!--l. 46632--><p class="indent" >   Suffering or Unsatisfactoriness (dukkha)
<!--l. 46634--><p class="indent" >   Not-self or Insubstantiality (anattaa).
<!--l. 46636--><p class="indent" >   The first and the third apply to inanimate existence as well, while the second
(suffering) is, of course, only an experience of the animate. The inanimate, however,
can be, and very often is, a cause of suffering for living beings: for instance, a falling
stone may cause injury or loss of property may cause mental pain. In that sense, the
three are common to all that is conditioned, even to what is below or beyond the
normal range of human perception.

<!--l. 46644--><p class="indent" >   Existence can be understood only if these three basic facts are comprehended,
and this not only logically, but in confrontation with one&#8217;s own experience.
Insight-wisdom (vipassanaa-pa~n~naa) which is the ultimate liberating factor in
Buddhism, consists just of this experience of the three characteristics applied
to one&#8217;s own bodily and mental processes, and deepened and matured in
meditation.
<!--l. 46651--><p class="indent" >   To "see things as they really are" means seeing them consistently in the light of
the three characteristics. Ignorance of these three, or self-deception about
them, is by itself a potent cause for suffering &#8212; by knitting, as it were, the
net of false hopes, of unrealistic and harmful desires, of false ideologies,
false values and aims of life, in which man is caught. Ignoring or distorting
these three basic facts can only lead to frustration, disappointment, and
despair.
<!--l. 46660--><p class="indent" >   Hence, from a positive as well as a negative angle, this teaching on the Three
Basic Facts of Existence is of such vital importance that it was thought desirable to
add here more material to those brief expositions that had already appeared in this
series.
<!--l. 46665--><p class="indent" >   Beginning with the present volume on Impermanence, each of the Three
Characteristics will receive separate treatment by different authors and from different
angles, with a great variety of approach.
<!--l. 46669--><p class="indent" >   Each of these three publications will be concluded by an essay of the late
Venerable 혀namoli Thera, in which all important canonical source material on the
respective Characteristic is collected, systematized, and discussed. These
tersely written articles merit close study and will be found very helpful in the
analytical as well as meditative approach to the subject. Regrettably, the
premature death of the venerable author prevented him from writing a fourth
article planned by him, which was to deal with the interrelation of the Three
Characteristics.
<!--l. 46678--><p class="indent" >   These three articles of the Venerable 혀namoli were originally written for the
Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, and the first one, on Anicca, appeared in Volume I, p.
657ff., of that work. For kind permission to reproduce these articles, the Buddhist
Publication Society is much obliged to the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopaedia, Dr.
G. P. Malalasekera, and to the publishers, the Department of Cultural Affairs,
Colombo.

<!--l. 46693--><p class="indent" >   The decisively characteristic thing about this world is its transience.
In this sense, centuries have no advantage over the present moment. Thus
the continuity of transience cannot give any consolation; the fact that life
blossoms among ruins proves not so much the tenacity of life as that of
death.

<!--l. 46703--><p class="indent" >   The perceiving of impermanence, bhikkhus, developed and frequently practiced,

removes all sensual passion, removes all passion for material existence, removes all
passion for becoming, removes all ignorance, removes and abolishes all conceit of "I
am."
<!--l. 46708--><p class="indent" >   Just as in the autumn a farmer, plowing with a large plow, cuts through all the
spreading rootlets as he plows; in the same way, bhikkhus, the perceiving of
impermanence, developed and frequently practiced, removes all sensual passion...
removes and abolishes all conceit of "I am."

<!--l. 46716--><p class="indent" >   It would be better, bhikkhus, if an uninstructed ordinary person regarded this
body, made of the four great elements, as himself rather than the mind. For what
reason? This body is seen to continue for a year, for two years, five years, ten years,
twenty years, fifty years, a hundred years, and even more. But of that which is called
mind, is called thought, is called consciousness, one moment arises and ceases as
another continually both day and night.

<!--l. 46730--><p class="indent" >   "Impermanent, subject to change, are component things. Strive on with
heedfulness!" This was the final admonition of the Buddha Gotama to his
disciples.
<!--l. 46734--><p class="indent" >   And when the Buddha had passed away, Sakka, the chief of the deities, uttered
the following:
<!--l. 46737--><p class="indent" >   Impermanent are all component things, They arise and cease, that is their nature:
They come into being and pass away, Release from them is bliss supreme. Aniccaa

<!--l. 46743--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Mahaa-Parinibbaana Sutta (DN 16)1
<!--l. 46745--><p class="indent" >   Even up to present times, at every Buddhist funeral in Theravada countries, this
very Pali verse is recited by the Buddhist monks who perform the obsequies, thus
reminding the congregation of the evanescent nature of life.
<!--l. 46750--><p class="indent" >   It is a common sight in Buddhist lands to see the devotees offer flowers and light
oil lamps before a Buddha image. They are not praying to the Buddha or to any
"supernatural being." The flowers that fade and the flames that die down, speak to
them of the impermanency of all conditioned things.
<!--l. 46756--><p class="indent" >   It is this single and simple word Impermanence (anicca) which is the very core of
the Buddha&#8217;s teaching, being also the basis for the other two characteristics of
existence, Suffering and No-self. The fact of Impermanence means that reality is
never static but is dynamic throughout, and this the modern scientists are
realizing to be the basic nature of the world without any exception. In his
teaching of dynamic reality, the Buddha gave us the master key to open any
door we wish. The modern world is using the same master key, but only
for material achievements, and is opening door after door with amazing
success.
<!--l. 46767--><p class="indent" >   Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal
existence. We cannot say of anything, animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic,
"this is lasting"; for even while we are saying this, it would be undergoing change. All

is fleeting; the beauty of flowers, the bird&#8217;s melody, the bee&#8217;s hum, and a sunset&#8217;s
glory.
<!--l. 46774--><p class="indent" >   Suppose yourself gazing on a gorgeous sunset. The whole western heavens are
glowing with roseate hues; but you are aware that within half an hour all these
glorious tints will have faded away into a dull ashen gray. You see them even now
melting away before your eyes, although your eyes cannot place before you the
conclusion which your reason draws. And what conclusion is that? That conclusion is
that you never, even for the shortest time that can be named or conceived, see
any abiding color, any color which truly is. Within the millionth part of a
second the whole glory of the painted heavens has undergone an incalculable
series of mutations. One shade is supplanted by another with a rapidity
which sets all measurements at defiance, but because the process is one
to which no measurements apply,... reason refuses to lay an arrestment on
any period of the passing scene, or to declare that it is, because in the very
act of being it is not; it has given place to something else. It is a series of
fleeting colors, no one of which is, because each of them continually vanishes in
another.
<!--l. 46791--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Ferrier&#8217;s Lectures and Remains Vol. I, p. 119, quoted in Sarva-dorsana-Sangraha,
London, p. 15
<!--l. 46794--><p class="indent" >   All component things &#8212; that is, all things which arise as the effect of causes, and
which in turn give rise to effects &#8212; can be crystallized in the single word anicca,
impermanence. All tones, therefore, are just variations struck on the chord which is
made up of impermanence, suffering (unsatisfactoriness), and no-self nor soul &#8212;
anicca, dukkha, and anattaa.
<!--l. 46801--><p class="indent" >   Camouflaged, these three characteristics of life prevail in this world until a
supremely Enlightened One reveals their true nature. It is to proclaim these three
characteristics &#8212; and how through complete realization of them, one attains to
deliverance of mind &#8212; that a Buddha appears. This is the quintessence, the sum
total of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching.
<!--l. 46808--><p class="indent" >   Although the concept of anicca applies to all compounded and conditioned things,
the Buddha is more concerned with the so-called being; for the problem is with man
and not with dead things. Like an anatomist who resolves a limb into tissues and
tissues into cells, the Buddha, the Analyzer (Vibhajjavaadi), analyzed the so-called
being, the sankhaara pu~nja, the heap of processes, into five ever-changing
aggregates, and made it clear that there is nothing abiding, nothing eternally
conserved, in this conflux of aggregates (khandhaa santati). They are: &#8212; &#8212;
material form or body; feeling or sensation; perception; mental formations;
consciousness.
<!--l. 46819--><p class="indent" >   The Enlightened One explains:
<!--l. 46821--><p class="indent" >   The five aggregates, monks, are anicca, impermanent; whatever is impermanent,
that is dukkha, unsatisfactory; whatever is dukkha, that is without attaa, self. What
is without self, that is not mine, that I am not, that is not my self. Thus should it be
seen by perfect wisdom (sammappa~n~naaya) as it really is. Who sees by perfect
wisdom, as it really is, his mind, not grasping, is detached from taints; he is
liberated.
<!--l. 46828--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 22.45

<!--l. 46830--><p class="indent" >   Naagarjuna only echoes the words of the Buddha when he says: When the
notion of an Aatman, Self or Soul cease, the notion of &#8217;mine&#8217; also ceases
and one becomes free from the idea of I and mine (Maadhyamika-Kaarikaa,
xviii.2)
<!--l. 46835--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha gives five very striking similes to illustrate the ephemeral nature of
the five aggregates. He compares material form to a lump of foam, feeling to a
bubble, perception to a mirage, mental formations to a plantain trunk (which is
pithless, without heartwood), and consciousness to an illusion, and asks: "What
essence, monks, could there be in a lump of foam, in a bubble, in a mirage, in a
plantain trunk, in an illusion?"
<!--l. 46843--><p class="indent" >   Continuing, the Buddha says:
<!--l. 46845--><p class="indent" >   Whatever material form there be: whether past, future, or present; internal or
external; gross or subtle; low or lofty; far or near; that material form the monk sees,
meditates upon, examines with systematic attention, he thus seeing, meditating
upon, and examining with systematic attention, would find it empty, he would find it
insubstantial and without essence. What essence, monks, could there be in material
form?
<!--l. 46852--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha speaks in the same manner of the remaining aggregates and
asks:
<!--l. 46855--><p class="indent" >   What essence, monks, could there be in feeling, in perception, in mental
formations and in consciousness?
<!--l. 46858--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 22.95
<!--l. 46860--><p class="indent" >   Thus we see that a more advanced range of thought comes with the analysis
of the five aggregates. It is at this stage that right understanding known
as insight (vipassanaa) begins to work. It is through this insight that the
true nature of the aggregates is grasped and seen in the light of the three
characteristics (ti-lakkhana), namely: impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and
no-self.
<!--l. 46867--><p class="indent" >   It is not only the five aggregates that are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and
without self, but the causes and conditions that produce the aggregates are also
impermanent, unsatisfactory, and without self. This point the Buddha makes very
clear:
<!--l. 46872--><p class="indent" >   Material form, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness, monks,
are impermanent (anicca). Whatever causes and conditions there are for the arising
of these aggregates, they, too, are impermanent. How monks, could aggregates arisen
from what is impermanent, be permanent?
<!--l. 46877--><p class="indent" >   Material form... and consciousness, monks, are unsatisfactory (dukkha); whatever
causes and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates, they too are
unsatisfactory. How, monks, could aggregates arise from what is unsatisfactory be
pleasant or pleasurable?
<!--l. 46882--><p class="indent" >   Material form... and consciousness, monks, are without a self (anattaa); whatever
causes and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates, they, too are
without self. How, monks, could aggregates arise from what is without self be self
(attaa)?
<!--l. 46887--><p class="indent" >   The instructed noble disciple (sutavaa ariyasaavako), monks, seeing thus
becomes dispassionate towards material form, feeling, perception, mental

formations and consciousness: Through dispassion he is detached; through
detachment he is liberated; in liberation the knowledge comes to be that he is
liberated, and he understands: Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity,
done is what was to be done, there is no more of this to come [meaning that
there is no more continuity of the aggregates, that is, no more becoming or
rebirth].
<!--l. 46896--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 22.7-9, abridged
<!--l. 46898--><p class="indent" >   It is always when we fail to see the true nature of things that our views become
clouded; because of our preconceived notions, our greed and aversion, our likes and
dislikes, we fail to see the sense organs and sense objects in their respective and
objective natures, (aayatanaana.m aayatana.t.ta.m) and go after mirages and
deceptions. The sense organs delude and mislead us and then we fail to see things in
their true light, so that our way of seeing things becomes perverted (vipariita
dassana).
<!--l. 46907--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha speaks of three kinds of illusion or perversions (vipallaasa, Skt.
viparyaasa) that grip man&#8217;s mind, namely: the illusions of perception, thought,
and view (sa~n~naa vipallaasa; citta vipallaasa; di.t.thi vipallaasa).2 Now
when a man is caught up in these illusions he perceives, thinks, and views
incorrectly.
<!--l. 46913--><p class="indent" >   He perceives permanence in the impermanent; satisfactoriness in the
unsatisfactory (ease and happiness in suffering); self in what is not self (a soul in the
soulless); beauty in the repulsive.
<!--l. 46917--><p class="indent" >   He thinks and views in the same erroneous manner. Thus each illusion works in
four ways (AN 4.49), and leads man astray, clouds his vision, and confuses him. This
is due to unwise reflections, to unsystematic attention (ayoniso manasikaara). Right
understanding (or insight meditation &#8212; vipassanaa) alone removes these illusions
and helps man to cognize the real nature that underlies all appearance. It is only
when man comes out of this cloud of illusions and perversions that he shines with
true wisdom like the full moon that emerges brilliant from behind a black
cloud.
<!--l. 46927--><p class="indent" >   The aggregates of mind and body, being ever subject to cause and effect, as we
saw above, pass through the inconceivably rapid moments of arising, presently
existing, and ceasing (uppaada, .thiti, bha"nga), just as the unending waves of the
sea or as a river in flood sweeps to a climax and subsides. Indeed, human life is
compared to a mountain stream that flows and rushes on, changing incessantly (AN
7.70) "nadisoto viya," like a flowing stream.
<!--l. 46935--><p class="indent" >   Heraclitus, that renowned Greek philosopher, was the first Western writer to
speak about the fluid nature of things. He taught the Panta Rhei doctrine, the flux
theory, at Athens, and one wonders if that teaching was transmitted to him from
India.
<!--l. 46940--><p class="indent" >   "There is no static being," says Heraclitus, "no unchanging substratum. Change,
movement, is Lord of the Universe. Everything is in a state of becoming, of continual
flux (Panta Rhei)."
<!--l. 46945--><p class="indent" >   He continues: "You cannot step twice into the same river; for fresh waters are ever
flowing in upon you." Nevertheless one who understands the root of the Dhamma
would go a step further and say: The same man cannot step twice into the same

river; for the so called man who is only a conflux of mind and body, never remains
the same for two consecutive moments."3
<!--l. 46952--><p class="indent" >   It should now be clear that the being whom for all practical purposes we call a
man, woman, or individual, is not something static, but kinetic, being in a state of
constant and continuous change. Now when a person views life and all that
pertains to life in this light, and understands analytically this so-called being
as a mere succession of mental and the bodily aggregates, he sees things
as they really are (yathaabhuutam). He does not hold the wrong view of
"personality belief," belief in a soul or self (sakkaaya di.t.thi), because he
knows through right understanding that all phenomenal existence is causally
dependent (pa.ticca-samuppanna), that each is conditioned by something
else, and that its existence is relative to that condition. He knows that as a
result there is no "I," no persisting psychic entity, no ego principle, no self
or anything pertaining to a self in this life process. He is, therefore, free
from the notion of a microcosmic soul (jiivaatma) or a macrocosmic soul
(paramaatma).
<!--l. 46969--><p class="indent" >   It is said that through insight meditation (vipassanaa) one sees things as they
really are (yathaabhuutam) and not as they appear to be. Viewing things
as they really are implies, as we discussed above, seeing the impermanent,
unsatisfactory, and no-self nature of all conditioned and component things. To such a
meditative disciple of the Buddha the "world" is not the external or the empirical
world, but the human body with its consciousness. It is the world of the five
aggregates of clinging (pa~nca upaadaanakkhandaa). It is this that he tries to
understand as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and without self or soul. It is to
this world of body and mind that the Buddha referred to when he said to
Mogharaaja, "Ever mindful, Mogharaaja, see the world as void (su~n~na); having
given up the notion of a self [underlying it] &#8212; so may one overcome death
(Maara); The King of Death sees not one who thus knows the world" (Sutta
Nipaata).
<!--l. 46985--><p class="indent" >   The sum total of the philosophy of change taught in Buddhism is that all
component things that have conditioned existence are a process and not a group of
abiding entities, but the changes occur in such rapid succession that people regard
mind and body as static entities. They do not see their arising and their breaking up
(udaya-vaya), but regard them unitarily, see them as a lump or whole (ghana
sa~n~naa).
<!--l. 46992--><p class="indent" >   It is very hard, indeed, for people who are accustomed to continually think of
their own mind and body and the external word with mental projections as wholes,
as inseparable units, to get rid of the false appearance of "wholeness." So long as
man fails to see things as processes, as movements, he will never understand the
anatta (no-soul) doctrine of the Buddha. That is why people impertinently and
impatiently put the question:
<!--l. 47000--><p class="indent" >   "If there is no persisting entity, no unchanging principle, like self or soul what is it
that experiences the results of deeds here and hereafter?"
<!--l. 47004--><p class="indent" >   Two different discourses (MN 109; SN 22.82) deal with this burning question. The
Buddha was explaining in detail to his disciples the impermanent nature of the five
aggregates, how they are devoid of self, and how the latent conceits "I am" and

"mine" cease to exist. Then there arose a thought in the mind of a certain monk
thus: "Material body is not self, feeling is not self, perception is not self, mental
formations are not self, consciousness is not self. Then what self do selfless deeds
affect?"
<!--l. 47014--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha, reading the thought of the monk&#8217;s mind, said, "The question was
beside the point" and made the monk understand the impermanent, unsatisfactory,
and non-self nature of the aggregates.
<!--l. 47018--><p class="indent" >   "It is wrong to say that the doer of the deed is the same as the one who
experiences its results. It is equally wrong to say that the doer of the deed and the
one who experiences its results are two different persons,"4 for the simple reason that
what we call life is a flow of psychic and physical processes or energies, arising and
ceasing constantly; it is not possible to say that the doer himself experiences results
because he is changing now, every moment of his life; but at the same time you
must not forget the fact that the continuity of life that is the continuance of
experience, the procession of events is not lost; it continues without a gap. The
child is not the same as an adolescent, the adolescent is not the same as the
adult, they are neither the same nor totally different persons (na ca so na ca
a~n~no, &#8212; Milinda Pa~nho). There is only a flow of bodily and mental
processes.
<!--l. 47034--><p class="indent" >   There are three types of teachers, the first one teaches that the ego or the self is
real now as well as in the future (here and hereafter); the second one teaches that the
ego is real only in this life, not in the future; the third one teaches that the
concept of an ego is an illusion: it is not real either in this life or in the
hereafter.
<!--l. 47040--><p class="indent" >   The first one is the eternalist (sassatavaadi); the second one is the annihilationist
(ucchedavaadi); the third one is the Buddha who teaches the middle way of
avoiding the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism. (Here the middle
way is the doctrine of dependent arising, or causal conditioning &#8212; Paticca
Samuppaada).
<!--l. 47046--><p class="indent" >   All theistic religions teach that the ego survives after death in some way or other,
and is not annihilated. The materialist&#8217;s concept is that the ego is annihilated at
death. The Buddhist view is that there is no ego, or anything substantial, or lasting,
but all things conditioned are subject to change, and they change not remaining the
same for two consecutive moments, and that there is a continuity but no
identity.
<!--l. 47054--><p class="indent" >   So long as man cherishes the idea of the lasting self or ego it will not be possible
for him to conceive the idea that all things are impermanent, that there is, in reality,
an arising and a ceasing of things (samudaya dhamma, vaya dhamma, &#8212;
Satipa.t.thaana sutta). The understanding of the anatta doctrine, which is
exclusively Buddhist, is indispensable in the understanding of the four noble truths
and the other principal tenets of Buddhism.
<!--l. 47062--><p class="indent" >   The people of the world today mark the changing nature of life. Although they
see it, they do not keep it in mind and act with dispassionate discernment. Though
change again and again speaks to them and makes them unhappy, they pursue their
mad career of whirling round the wheel of existence and are twisted and torn between
the spokes of agony. They cherish the belief that it is possible to discover a

way of happiness in this very change, to find a center of security in this
circle of impermanence. They imagine that although the world is uncertain
they can make it certain and give it a solid basis, and so the unrelenting
struggle for worldly improvement goes on with persevering effort and futile
enthusiasm.
<!--l. 47074--><p class="indent" >   History has proved again and again and will continue to prove that nothing in
this world is lasting. All things when clung to fail. Nations and civilizations rise,
flourish, and die away as waves upon the ocean, yielding place to new, and thus the
scrolls of time record the passing pageant, the baseless vision, and the fading flow
that is human history.

<!--l. 47115--><p class="indent" >   Insights and discoveries revealed to human minds 2500 years ago, at the time of
the Buddha (or even several centuries before that time), may have caused deep and
revolutionary effects in the evolution of existing world views, no less important than
the discoveries of Galileo and Copernicus have been for the eventual collapse of the
world-view of medieval Christian civilization. These latter discoveries, which mark
the outset of modern civilization, have become so much a part of commonplace or
general information that they can be imparted to children in the lowest
grades of elementary education, and are normally absorbed by them without
difficulty.
<!--l. 47126--><p class="indent" >   The idea of impermanence and of ceaseless change, due to the never-ending
"chain" of causes and effects (the subject which we are attempting to approach in
its Buddhist version of aniccam) has, in its broad meaning, become one of
our stereotyped and oversimplified truisms, reduced, both in its formal and
substantial significance, to a mere rudiment of conventional word-meaning. As

such, it may still have impressed us on the level of nursery rhymes and even
of some grammar-school classics in the history of literature. (If I had to
choose a deeper adequation33 founded on a modern poet&#8217;s more complex
philosophical intuition, I would not hesitate to select the lines from T.S. Eliot&#8217;s
Quartets;
<!--l. 47138--><p class="indent" >   Ash on an old man&#8217;s sleeve Is all the ash the burnt roses leave ... Water and fire
succeed The town, the pasture and the weed.)
<!--l. 47141--><p class="indent" >   We might hope to rediscover the original significance and historical purport of
such truisms only if we were to look for them purposively, guided by some subjective
impressions of individual or particular cases, and by the consequences of their
concrete application in actual scientific or philosophical theories. This is what I am
about to hint at in a few examples.
<!--l. 47148--><p class="indent" >   One: As a young teacher, when for the first time I tried to explain to children of
about twelve years of age the biological process of growing cabbages and
potatoes, my emphasis on the importance of dung (I did not use the technical
term "fertilizer") happened to be so impressive that the next day a mother
came to complain against my "direct method" and "drastic naturalism" in
visual teaching. Her child had been so affected by my discourse as to develop
an acute loathing against food. Thus I was impressed how easily our most
commonplace truisms about the laws of nature &#8212; whose discovery, once
upon a time, may have been treated and even punished as revolutionary by
respectable and authoritative social institutions &#8212; can still reveal themselves
unexpectedly in their full overpowering force to the fresh and innocent minds of new
generations.
<!--l. 47163--><p class="indent" >   Two: In my own generation of teenagers, between the two wars in Europe, the
deadlock between science and religion was so complete that secondary school
curricula were bound to provoke in our minds an unavoidable crisis of conscience.
Teachers on the whole were totally involved in this struggle of convictions, keen to
win us over to one side or the other. The side of science against religion was
normally the stronger. Since that time religion, defeated in Europe, has
become more and more a prohibited fruit, and has therefore acquired a new
attractive force for juvenile minds. This is true not only in the eastern parts
of Europe, since science is far from being a privilege of Communism. An
anti-scientific tendency in Europe ("continental") philosophy has even become
predominant, on account of the moral catastrophe which still preoccupies the
minds of our generation beyond any other problem of "man&#8217;s position in the
universe."
<!--l. 47178--><p class="indent" >   The central issue in this conflict between science and religion, at least from our
youthful bias at that time, was of course the problem of anattaa ("no-soul"), to
express it by the corresponding Buddhist term. Laws governing processes of causes
and effects were, however, scientifically explained &#8212; or at least so understood
by our unripe minds, under the impression of the open dispute between
science and (Christian) religion. The explanations were not yet in terms of
the scientific equivalent to a pure annica-vaado (theory of impermanence),
which would imply a denial of the underlying material substantiality of the
world. Instead of that, explanations given to us at that time still followed the

classical Greek pattern of mechanistic materialism or static atomism, which was
the closest to the Buddhist understanding of the uccheda-vaado (theory of
destruction), whose believers are described in Pali texts in the following
terms:
<!--l. 47194--><p class="indent" >   ...He then hears the Perfect One expounding the teaching for the removal of
all grounds for "views," of all prejudices, obsessions, dogmas, and biases,
for the stilling of all processes, for the relinquishment of all substrata of
existence, for the extirpation of craving, for dispassion, cessation, extinction. He
then thinks, "I shall be annihilated, I shall be destroyed! No longer shall I
exist!" Hence he grieves, is depressed and laments; beating his breast, he
weeps, and dejection befalls him. Thus, bhikkhus, is there anxiety about
realities.
<!--l. 47204--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; MN 22
<!--l. 47206--><p class="indent" >   To this, the only authentic answer is:
<!--l. 47208--><p class="indent" >   Since in this very life a tathaagata (in this case generally understood as a human
being in the widest sense) is not to be regarded as existing in truth, in reality, is it
proper for you to assert: "as I understand the doctrine taught by the Exalted One,
insofar as a bhikkhu has destroyed the aasavas [life&#8217;s "intoxicants" or passions]
he is broken up and perishes when body is broken up, he exists not after
death."?
<!--l. 47216--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 22.85
<!--l. 47218--><p class="indent" >   The logical possibility of such an answer is excluded by the premise. The same
premise, however, excludes also the opposite, affirmative, possibility. (We shall
return to this problem, as understood by contemporary philosophy, in section
Five.)
<!--l. 47223--><p class="indent" >   Is important to underline here that, on the same premise, uccheda-vaado, or
simply the materialistic belief in a substantial "destruction" of any form of
being, is the extreme opposite of any authentic nihilism in ontology and
epistemology (theory of being and theory of knowledge). Only an explicitly
idealistic philosophy, "looking upon the world as a bubble, as a mirage" (Dhp
170) can be nihilistic in some respect, while uccheda-vaado as a "theory of
destruction" necessarily presupposes an existentially rooted belief in material
substance.
<!--l. 47233--><p class="indent" >   It was just in this sense, in the midst of the battle-ground between science and
religion, and on the eve of a world war, that the children of the first half of the
20th century had to face the fatality of a physical and moral destruction,
scientifically and infallibly precalculated, as experience was about to prove.
Yet just over the edge of our intellectual horizon was dawning a time, for
science at least, of acquiring a completely different position vis-a-vis the
problem of impermanence and relativity as affecting the deepest subatomic
structure of the world &#8212; a position considerably closer to the Buddhist idea of
aniccam.
<!--l. 47243--><p class="indent" >   Three: Since 1927, Bertrand Russell&#8217;s book, An Outline of Philosophy, has been
widely quoted as one of the best popular presentations of the radical change in the
scientific world-view stemming from Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity and of the
resulting development of nuclear physics. I shall try to elicit from Russell&#8217;s

statements, as far as the present draft of pointers to our essential problem may
permit, the rejection of the substance-view by modern science, because it is the
rejection of the substance-view that constitutes the core of the Buddhist anicca-vaado
as a foundation (at least in the ti-lakkha.nam scheme) of both dukkham and
anattaa.
<!--l. 47254--><p class="indent" >   To start with, let us define the idea of physical "substance" by means of its basic
description and philosophical implication has stated in the Sutta-pi.takam sources.
The problem of substance, as defined by scientific (lokaa-yatam) theories at the time
of the Buddha, finds its classical formulation, categorial delimitation and solution in
concise terms in his concluding answer to Kevaddho:
<!--l. 47261--><p class="indent" >   Where do earth, water, fire, and wind; long and short; fine and coarse; pure and
impure, no footing find?
<!--l. 47264--><p class="indent" >   Where is it that both name and form die out, leaving no trace behind?
<!--l. 47266--><p class="indent" >   When intellection (vi~n~naanam) ceases they all cease, too.
<!--l. 47269--><p class="indent" >   DN 11
<!--l. 47271--><p class="indent" >   For the categorical relation of mind and matter (or "name and form," naamaa
ruupam, as implied in the foregoing formulation), the following statement of the
Buddha is the most adequate and also the best-known in connection with our
subject:
<!--l. 47276--><p class="indent" >   It would be better, bhikkhus, for the unlearned worldling to regard this body,
built up of the four elements, as his self rather than the mind. For it is evident that
this body may last for a year, for two years, for three, four, five or ten years... or even
for a hundred years and more. But that which is called thought, or mind, or
consciousness, continuously, during day and night, arises as one thing, and passes
away as another thing.
<!--l. 47284--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 12.61
<!--l. 47286--><p class="indent" >   Now, let us get a few quotations from Bertrand Russell.4 First, as regards
substance-matter, he says:
<!--l. 47289--><p class="indent" >   In former days, you could believe it on a philosophical ground that the soul is a
substance and all substances are indestructible... But the notion of substance, in the
sense of a permanent entity with changing states, is no longer applicable to the
world.
<!--l. 47294--><p class="indent" >   A wave in the sea persists for a longer or shorter time: the waves that I see
dashing themselves to pieces on the Cornish coast may have come all the way from
Brazil, but that does not mean that a "thing" has traveled across the Atlantic; it
means only that a certain process of change has traveled.
<!--l. 47300--><p class="indent" >   [Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity] has philosophical consequences which are, if
possible, even more important. The substitution of space-time for space and time has
made the category of substance less applicable than formerly, since the essence
of substance was persistent through time, and there is now no one cosmic
time.
<!--l. 47306--><p class="indent" >   We found that matter, in modern science, has lost its solidity and substantiality;
it has become a mere ghost haunting the scenes of its former splendor... The
notion of matter, in modern physics, has become absorbed into the notion of
energy.
<!--l. 47311--><p class="indent" >   We cannot say that "matter is the cause of our sensations."... In a word, "matter"

has become no more than a conventional shorthand for stating causal laws concerning
events.
<!--l. 47315--><p class="indent" >   Thus we are committed to causation as an a priori belief without which we should
have no reason for supposing that there is a "real" chair (or any thing) at
all.
<!--l. 47319--><p class="indent" >   Next, as regards the theory of events, we note that the idea of fixed and static
elements of "matter" has been replaced by that of undeterminable "events"
corresponding to the quantum electrodynamic field theory in nuclear physics, which
comes very close to the conception of a non-physical but purely phenomenological
idea of dhammaa, implied in its primitive significance by kha.nika-vaado, or
theory of momentariness, of the Abhidhamma-pi.takam. (This latter aspect,
explicitly philosophical, will be sketched in Five, below.) Of this Russell
writes:
<!--l. 47329--><p class="indent" >   Everything in the world is composed of "events."... An "event" is something
occupying a small finite amount of space-time... Events are not impenetrable, as
matter is supposed to be; on the contrary, every event in space-time is overlapped by
other events.
<!--l. 47335--><p class="indent" >   I assume that every event is contemporaneous with events that are not
contemporaneous with each other; this is what is meant by saying that every event
lasts for a finite time... Time is wholly relational.
<!--l. 47339--><p class="indent" >   Space-time order, as well as space-time points, results from the relations between
events.
<!--l. 47342--><p class="indent" >   Compare with this last statement, and with those that follow, the assertion of
Buddhaghosa in Atthasaalini: "By time the sage described the mind, and by mind
described the time."
<!--l. 47346--><p class="indent" >   Lastly, Russell says of mental events:
<!--l. 47348--><p class="indent" >   An important group of events, namely percepts, may be called "mental."
<!--l. 47350--><p class="indent" >   Mentality is an affair of causal laws, not of the quality of single events, and also,
mentality is a matter of degree.
<!--l. 47353--><p class="indent" >   What is mind?... Mind must be a group of mental events, since we have
rejected the view that it is a single simple entity such as the ego was formerly
supposed to be... Its constitution corresponds however to "the unity of one
&#8217;experience.&#8217;"
<!--l. 47358--><p class="indent" >   As a result of these considerations, Russell concludes that "first of all, you must
cut out the word &#8217;I&#8217;: the person who believes is an inference, not a part of what you
know immediately."
<!--l. 47362--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the logical possibility of an uccheda-vaado (theory of destruction)
"heresy" is explicitly eliminated even on this level of merely scientific considerations:
"Is a mind a structure of material units? I think it is clear that the answer to this
question is in the negative."
<!--l. 47368--><p class="indent" >   We can conclude this survey by accepting without any further reserve Russell&#8217;s
statement: "The problems we have been raising are none of them new, but they
suffice to show that our everyday views of the world and of our relations to it are
unsatisfactory."
<!--l. 47373--><p class="indent" >   Four: Recently, field theory, as a replacement for the abandoned substance theory
in physics, has found increasing application &#8212; at least as a hypothetical analogy &#8212;

in other spheres of scientific thought, and even more in philosophical speculations
limited to possible (and sometimes to impossible) extensions of "special sciences." Its
application to parapsychology is of particular interest, for the extension of the
subject in which we are interested is beyond the strictly physical sphere of
being.
<!--l. 47382--><p class="indent" >   It is Gardner Murphy who has given us the most consequent and exclusive
elaboration of a parapsychological analogy of field theory, as far as I know. A
summarized recapitulation of his thesis is as follows:
<!--l. 47386--><p class="indent" >   The action of living matter on living matter is never a case of single cell acting
only on single cell. The structural whole or field is always involved. The field principle
may hold in psychics as well as in physics, and a psychic field may extend backwards
and forwards in time as well as onwards in space. The question, "Does personality
survive death?" is therefore in Murphy&#8217;s view not a reasonable question to ask. If any
psychical activity survives, it will become an aspect of different fields and will thus
take on new qualities and new structural relationships. It is evident that for him "all
personal activities are constantly changing context and interacting with
those of others, and it may be that each one becomes part of the cosmic
process."5
<!--l. 47399--><p class="indent" >   Another worker in the field of parapsychology, C. G. Broad, investigating The
Mind and Its Place in Nature from the standpoint of a possible "survival" of the
"PSI component," draws the conclusion, from the same basic analogy with physics,
that "we need no longer suppose that, although a surviving PSI component may be
bodiless, it is necessarily unextended and unlocalized, for we are nowadays well
accustomed to such phenomena as electro-magnetic fields which cannot be
called bodies in the ordinary sense but which still have structure and definite
properties and dispositions. We must not think of it (i.e., of the surviving
PSI-component) as something on which an experience makes an impression as a seal
does on a ball of wax. On the contrary, such a substanceless theory implies
a greater degree of survival than the mere persistence of an inactive PSI
component."6
<!--l. 47413--><p class="indent" >   Exponents of the same parapsychological theory also maintain that their
hypothesis might offer a more adequate basis for explanation of subconscious
phenomena investigated by psychoanalysis, particularly Jung&#8217;s archetypes, than the
initial Freudian attempts, which have been characterized since the first as a
scientifically untenable Platonic analogy with "pigeon holes" as the basic structure of
the soul.
<!--l. 47421--><p class="indent" >   All these more or less ad hoc analogies with the field theory in physics can be
brought down as well to an earlier metaphysical hypothesis, formulated on a broader
philosophical basis already by William James, in his Pluralistic Universe (1909).7
Speaking of the structure of "our inner life," James says:
<!--l. 47427--><p class="indent" >   Every bit of us at every moment is part and parcel of a wider self... May not you
and I be confluent in a higher consciousness, and confluently active there, though we
now know it not?... The analogies with... facts of psychical research, so called, and
with those of religious experience, establish... a decidedly formidable probability in
favor [of the following pluralistic hypothesis:]
<!--l. 47434--><p class="indent" >   Why should we envelop our many with the "one" that brings so many poisons in

its train?... [instead of accepting] along with the superhuman consciousness the
notion that it is not all-embracing; the notion, in other words, that there is a
God, but that he is finite, either in power or in knowledge, or in both at
once.
<!--l. 47441--><p class="indent" >   This is exactly the basic distinction between the Vedaantic and the Buddhist
conception of God, or gods, implying also the reason why James, in some respects,
was in favor of a polytheistic conception, as a "result of our criticism of the
absolute," in the same context.
<!--l. 47447--><p class="indent" >   Five: Such adaptation of hypotheses borrowed ad hoc from heterogenous fields of
science could and should be ultimately verified and explained only by proper
philosophical investigation, using autonomous methods and established on its own,
purely anthropological ground. Since the beginning of the 20th century this has
indeed been done, always more clearly and explicitly. The results have been
considerable, at least as far as the problem of our primordial concern is involved: the
human value aspect of aniccam, its fundamental significance in connection with both
dukkham and anattaa.
<!--l. 47457--><p class="indent" >   The proper philosophical attitude was defined, not as pertaining to the physical
but rather to the historical world-view, as early as the end of the 19th century, by
Wilhelm Dilthey, founder of the modern philosophy of culture:
<!--l. 47462--><p class="indent" >   The final pronouncement of the historical world-view is that human accomplishment
of every sort is relative, that everything is moving in process and nothing is
stable.
<!--l. 47466--><p class="indent" >   And yet this historical orientation has not maintained a position of predominant
importance in 20th century European philosophy. The most prominent philosopher of
culture in the middle of this century, Karl Jaspers, in discussing the priority of the
question "What is man?" (As formulated by Kant) points out that this priority "does
not mean that the knowledge of being is to be replaced by the knowledge of man.
Being still remains the essential, but man can approach it only through his existence
as a man," i.e., through his historicity.8
<!--l. 47476--><p class="indent" >   Following Edmund Husserl, who established the most widely adopted logical and
epistemological platform for European or continental philosophy in this century, the
problem of being has acquired and sustained a role of central importance. In
order to avoid its gross misunderstanding it is necessary, especially from our
Buddhist standpoint, to note that Husserl&#8217;s basic postulate, "Back to the
things themselves," does not in any way imply a substantialist meaning of
"things" in the classical, physically oriented ontology or theory of being,
which has been rejected by modern physics. The significance of "being"
has been radically changed with the achievement of a deeper insight into
both its physical and historical structure. This is revealed very clearly in the
analysis of being by Nicolai Hartmann who, more than Husserl and his closer
followers, concentrated on implications of the ontological problem in the natural
sciences.
<!--l. 47492--><p class="indent" >   In this respect the standpoint of A.N. Whitehead in Anglo-American philosophy
comes closest to that of N. Hartmann. Russell&#8217;s theory of infinitesimal "space-time
events" was not much more than an attempt to reduce to a pale rationalized scheme
Whitehead&#8217;s metaphysical conception of "actual occasions" and "throbbing

actualities," understood as "pulsation of experience" whose "drops" or "puffs of
existence" guided by an internal teleology in their "concrescence" (analogous to the
Buddhist sa"nkaaraa in karmic formations) join the "stream of existence"
(bhava"nga-soto).
<!--l. 47504--><p class="indent" >   The core of the abhidhammo conception of the "stream of existence"
consists in its "theory of momentariness" kha.nika-vaado. Its modern analogy
has found its first and best formulation in plain terms in the philosophy of
William James, especially in his essay "Does &#8217;Consciousness&#8217; Exist?," where the
"stream of consciousness" or "stream of thinking" (which, "when scrutinized,
reveals itself to consist chiefly of the stream of my breathing") is elicited from
his basic theory of "pure experience," defined as "the instant field of the
present... this succession of an emptiness and fullness that have reference to
each other and are of one flesh" &#8212; succession "in small enough pulses,"
which "is the essence of the phenomenon." In the same connection, as "the
result of our criticism of the absolute," the metaphysical and metapsychical
idea of a "central self" is reduced by James to "the conscious self of the
moment."9
<!--l. 47523--><p class="indent" >   The well-known Buddhist thesis of "no-self" (anattaa), or of a soul-less
psychology, is based on the same background of the "theory of momentariness."
<!--l. 47527--><p class="indent" >   This is also one of the points &#8212; and the most significant one &#8212; on which the
philosophical conception of James coincides with Bergson. Terminologically at least,
Bergson&#8217;s designation of the same "stream" as "flux du vecu," the word "vecu"
("lived") seems to come closest to the meaning of the Pali bhava"ngo, suggesting the
"articulated" (a"ngo) texture of life-experience.
<!--l. 47536--><p class="indent" >   In Husserl&#8217;s interpretation, "things" are simply taken to mean "whatever
is given," that which we "see" in consciousness, and this "given" is called
phenomenal in the sense that it "appears" to our consciousness. The Greek word
"phenomenon" does not necessarily indicate that there is an unknown thing behind
phenomena (as in Kant&#8217;s philosophy or in the Vedaanta), or a "back-stage" being,
as Nietzsche ironically exposed it. From our standpoint, it is important to
emphasize that Husserl&#8217;s phenomenological method "is neither deductive nor
empirical, but consists in pointing to what is given and elucidating it."10
It claims, in other words, to be yathaa-bhuutam, or "adequate to [actual]
being."
<!--l. 47551--><p class="indent" >   The analysis of the original meaning of the Greek term "phenomenon"
has been performed in masterly fashion by Martin Heidegger.11 The word
"phenomenon" (from the verb phainesthai, "let see," which is similar to the
Pali ehi-passiko) has two meanings relevant for philosophy. The first is "to
show itself," the second, "to seem as." Contemporary phenomenological
philosophy uses it in the first sense, as "merely letting something be seen,
letting entities be perceived." The secondary meaning, indicating something
which seems to "remain hidden, or which relapses or gets covered again, or
shows itself only &#8217;in disguise,&#8217;" points to the historical process of constructing
theories and "views" (Greek doxa, Sanskrit dristi, Pali di.t.thi) by which the
primordially "uncovered" phenomena are rather concealed again, or kept in
disguise.

<!--l. 47567--><p class="indent" >   The same basic idea is adopted by Nicolai Hartmann: "That a being is &#8217;in it-self&#8217;
means to say that it exists actually and not only for us... Being-in-itself does not need
to be proved, it is given as the world itself is given."12 Hartmann&#8217;s most valuable
contribution, however, is his entrance into the profound analysis of what was above
called the secondary meaning of the philosophical term "phenomenon." His
analysis distinguishes "spheres" and "levels" of being: Broadly, there are two
primary spheres, designated as real and ideal being. In the sphere of the
real, four structural levels are distinguished: matter, life, consciousness, and
mind.
<!--l. 47579--><p class="indent" >   In contexts eliciting such statements, it appears more and more obvious, from a
Buddhist standpoint, how closely the meaning of the term phenomenon, as used in
contemporary philosophy, approximates the basic meaning of dhamma in the
abhidhamma theory. (The last instance quoted from Hartmann may remind us even
more specifically of the khandhaa structures.)
<!--l. 47585--><p class="indent" >   However, beyond the possibility of extending this analogy of phenomenon as
disclosure of "being-in-itself" understood as a process, it is felt more and more by
several contemporary European philosophers (just as was the case in the original
Buddhist counterpart) that the ontological purport of being, thus understood as
phenomenon or dhammo, must still be limited by a critical principle of essentially
deeper significance. This principle has found its first &#8212; and until now its clearest &#8212;
logical formulation in the caatu-ko.tikam (tetralemma) rule by the Buddha, as he
regularly applies it to the avyaakataani or "not-designated" problems, or "dialectical
antinomies"13 of speculative thought: "Neither being, nor non-being, nor
both being-and-non-being, nor neither-being-nor-non-being" can express
the existential purport and content of human reality. The word "being," or
any other derivate from the verb "to be," cannot adequately express the
immediate intuition (vipassanaa) of existence, or the essence of actuality (as
paramattho).
<!--l. 47604--><p class="indent" >   This deficiency of the basic ontological term "being" has been subtly analyzed by
Heidegger in his Introduction to Metaphysics. Yet with him the philosophy of
existence (or human actuality) has taken a prevalently ontological direction (as a
phenomenological analysis of being). It has become a philosophy of our human
being-in-the-world, and consequently a philosophy of "anguish" or dukkham, even
though it was soon felt that this ontological turning does not, and cannot,
adequately reflect either the primordial motives or the ultimate scope of
existential thinking. Without entering into the historical background of such
inner divergences in contemporary philosophy, I should like to point out
a few symptomatic objections which can be compared in their radically
anti-ontological attitude with the principle of the Buddha as formulated
above.
<!--l. 47618--><p class="indent" >   According to the Buddha, the person reaping the fruits of good and bad actions
(in a future life) is neither the same one who has committed these actions nor a
different one. The same principle applies to the structural identification of a person in
any other respect and circumstance, in the stream of one single physical
life.
<!--l. 47624--><p class="indent" >   The French philosopher Gabriel Marcel, discussing the problem of the structural

unity of human personality, comes (at least on the basic level) to the conclusion that
"the relation between my body and myself cannot be described as either &#8217;being&#8217; or
&#8217;having&#8217;: I am my body and yet I cannot identify myself with it."14 "Existing" does
not mean being an object. On this supposition, Marcel develops his critical analysis
of the two inadequate extreme terms of existence in his main work, Being and
Having.
<!--l. 47634--><p class="indent" >   Another representative of the same trend in French philosophy, Jean Wahl, seems
to approximate more nearly the actual meaning of the Buddha&#8217;s avyaakataani
(specified above), not from formal logical or even linguistic considerations, but rather
out of an essentially congenial understanding of the deeper problem: "We are
concerned with questions which, strictly speaking, belong to solitary meditation and
cannot be subjects of discourse."15
<!--l. 47642--><p class="indent" >   Nicolas Berdyaev, an explicitly religious philosopher close to the same group, has
given one of the clearest formulations of the point under discussion:
<!--l. 47646--><p class="indent" >   "The problem which faces us is: Is being a product of objectification?
Is not the concept of being concerned with being qua concept, does being
possess existence at all?... Why is ontology impossible? Because it is always
a knowledge of objectifying existence. In an ontology the idea of being is
objectified and an objectification is already an existence which is alienated in the
objectification. So that in ontology &#8212; in every ontology &#8212; existence vanishes... It
is only in subjectivity that one may know existence, not in objectivity. In
my opinion, the central idea has vanished in the ontology of Heidegger and
Sartre."16
<!--l. 47657--><p class="indent" >   In agreement with Dilthey&#8217;s principle, quoted above, establishing the historical
world-view of the cultural sciences independently from the scientific investigation of
essentially objective physical nature, Heidegger has limited his inquiry on "time as
the horizon for all understanding of being." Against that background, he has
criticized and abandoned the old substantialist ontology. For him, "temporality is the
very being of human reality." The relation time-mind, as quoted above from
Buddhaghosa&#8217;s Atthasaalini, is for Heidegger also exhaustive for both terms. And yet
Berdyaev, like the other anti-ontologist philosophers mentioned here, criticizes even
this essential turning in contemporary "anthropological ontology," as at least a
partial failure to understand authentic existential experience: "As a man
Heidegger is deeply troubled by this world of care, fear, death, and daily
dullness." Despite this, and beyond that sincerity, his philosophy "is not
existential philosophy, and the depth of existence does not make itself felt in
it."17
<!--l. 47675--><p class="indent" >   The reason for this was stated clearly and explicitly by Karl Jaspers, who was the
first to criticize and abandon the ontological position in contemporary European
philosophy, at the same time that Heidegger undertook his essential reform of its
fundamental conception. In the view of Jaspers, "the ideal followed by ontologies is
the perfectioning of the rational structure of the objectified world. Technical sciences
have to help us bring about engineered existences." Jaspers was, from the very
beginning of his philosophical critique (about 1930), extremely aware of the danger of
such scientific technicalization of human existence: "As an attempt to bind us to
objectified being, ontology sublates freedom." In his view, it is only "as potential

existence that I am able to lift myself up from bondage. My chains will thus become
the material of being..." The opposite way of an "engineered" civilization
will transform me into a slave of that "material" and this actually is the
typical form of suffering, of dukkham, by which "man in the modern age" is
oppressed.18
<!--l. 47693--><p class="indent" >   In his advanced years, Jaspers has discovered the Buddhist philosopher
Naagaarjuna as one of the most congenial minds,19 while Heidegger, when reading
D.T. Suzuki&#8217;s Essays on Zen Buddhism, confessed that this was exactly what he had
tried to express all his life long.
<!--l. 47698--><p class="indent" >   Six: It was doubt of the material substance of the world which, to a considerable
extent, provoked the problem of verifying the very idea of being, of the "selfhood" of
the world, both in its exterior aspect and in that which is interior to the human
being-in-the-world. What "doubt" was at the outset of critical philosophy
in the period of its substantialist and objectifying orientation (following
Descartes), disappointment, the "unsatisfactoriness" of the world, has become for
the actual, subjectively oriented or introverted, humanistic philosophy of
existence.
<!--l. 47709--><p class="indent" >   One of the best expressions of this turning can be found in some of the statements
of Gabriel Marcel, who, by the way, defines his religious philosophy as a "doctrine
of hope." Its basic postulate is that philosophy must be "transobjective,
personal, dramatic, indeed tragic. &#8217;I am not witnessing a spectacle&#8217;; we should
remind ourselves of this every day."20 The Buddhist implication of this
basic attitude may be pursued still further in the earlier formulation by
Kierkegaard: "Life is a masquerade... Your occupation consists in preserving
your hiding place... In fact you are nothing; you are merely a relation to
others, and what you are, you are by virtue of this relation... When the
enchantment of illusion is broken, when existence begins to totter, then too does
despair manifest itself as that which was at the bottom. Despair itself is a
negativity, unconsciousness of it is a new negativity... This is the sickness unto
death."21
<!--l. 47725--><p class="indent" >   It is only by abandoning the attitude of fascination for the "spectacle" of the
statically staged "Being" of the world that man becomes sufficiently movable that he
is fit to plunge into the stream of existence, no longer attached to some stage-prop or
"remainder." Is only then that he can really start swimming along that stream of
sa.msaaro, realizing that it is pure and simple aniccam or impermanent flux,
and that he can eventually become aware of the advantage of "crossing"
it.
<!--l. 47735--><p class="indent" >   This is the point which contemporary European philosophy seems to
be about to realize. It is essential for this realization that the principles of
aniccam and dukkham be inseparably reconnected through the intuition of
their immediate interaction. In the actual situation, it will no longer even be
necessary to deduce explicitly the idea of anattaa as the dynamic resultant
of the confrontation of the first two principles. Just like aniccam, anattaa
has already become a truism for most Europeans, whom a standardized
mental training, both scientific and philosophical has carried beyond the God
and Soul dogma.22 The phantom of the Western version of a materialistic

uccheda-vaado is likewise about to be dispelled. The critical missing link has only
been between impermanence (aniccam) and suffering (dukkham). Due to the
objectifying nature of scientific thinking, this link could never be revealed
by a philosophy of nature subservient to science, not even of the type of
Russell&#8217;s popular literary criticism quoted above. It is obvious that only an
existential experience of dukkham, suffering or "anguish," could bring about this
realization.
<!--l. 47753--><p class="indent" >   Today we have to thank, for this realization, the catastrophic results and further
consequences, still being suffered, of two world wars in the 20th century. That is why
a new philosophy, already nascent on the eve of the Second World War, has
emerged in Europe explicitly as a philosophy of conscience rather than of mere
consciousness. It should appear equally obvious that in such a philosophy there is no
longer any place for the stubborn false dilemma: philosophy or religion. This
last problem, which concerns "philosophical faith," is more important for
Buddhism than for any other religion. It has found its best diagnostical
expression in several essays of Karl Jaspers, from which we extract a few
hints:
<!--l. 47765--><p class="indent" >   It is questionable whether faith is possible without religion. Philosophy originates
in this question... Man deprived of his faith by the loss of his religion is devoting
more decisive thought to the nature of his own being... No longer does the revealed
Deity upon whom all is dependent come first, and no longer the world that exists
around us; what comes first is man, who, however, cannot make terms with
himself as being, but strives to transcend himself... The unsheltered individual
gives our epoch its physiognomy... [Formerly] the authority of the church
sheltered him and sustained him, gave him peace and happiness... Today
philosophy is the only refuge for those who, in full awareness, are not sheltered by
religion.23
<!--l. 47777--><p class="indent" >   Obviously, "faith" is here no longer understood as a belief in any revelation, but
as reasonable trust in a qualified spiritual guide whose moral and intellectual
capacities have to be carefully tested in each single case by a sound and mature
criterion (apa.n.nako dhammo) such as was established by the Buddha in his critical
discourses on religion, Apa.n.naka-suttam and Ca.nki-suttam (MN 60 and 95), in
order to exclude empty and blind transmission of religious traditions "as a basket
handed over from one to the other," or in "a string of blind men." "One
oneself is the guardian of oneself; what other guardian could there be?" (Dhp
160)
<!--l. 47789--><p class="indent" >   Jean-Paul Sartre is another philosopher who, though himself not religious, realizes
the tremendous importance of the religious problem from the bias of our critical age,
and still more specifically from the bias of the deepest metaphysical implications of
the idea of aniccam, as non-substantiality, undermining the scientific foundation of
19th century materialism: The tragic situation of human reality in the world consists
in the fact that due to his karmic "freedom" man "is not what he is, man is what he
is not." This statement, whose implications have scandalized many conservative
Christian minds, nevertheless corresponds to the gist of St. Augustine&#8217;s
thought as rendered by Jaspers out of a different deeply religious concern
with the undeniable facticity of the same existential situation: "I am myself,

but I can fail myself. I must put my trust in myself, but I cannot rely on
myself."24
<!--l. 47804--><p class="indent" >   As for Sartre, his first deduction from this basic realization of anicca-anattaa is
that as such "man is a useless passion." "Human reality is the pure effort to become
God without there being any given substratum for that effort... Desire expresses this
endeavor... Fundamentally man is the desire to be." As such, he is always only a
"project" &#8212; ceaselessly "catapulted" from the past to the future (as Ortega y Gasset
has formulated it), without a natural possibility of finding poise in his own present.
This is the tragedy of his "temporalization," whose ultimate meaning is aniccam.
This is how "the existence of desire as a human fact is sufficient to prove that
human reality is a lack." How, then, is a possibility of ultimate escape or
"liberation" conceivable? It is because human reality "is a being such that in its
being, its being is in question in the form of a project of being." On this
basis only, "We can ascertain more exactly what is the being of the self: it is
value."25
<!--l. 47823--><p class="indent" >   He who wants to delve deeper into such possibilities, it would seem, should follow
the advice of Gabriel Marcel or of Berdyaev, and try to cross beyond the possibilities
expressed in any philosophy of being. The Buddhist fitting, or "raft," though
considerably larger in its basic frame, is readily adaptable to their explicit
requirements: "Neither being, nor non-being, nor both being-and-non-being, nor
neither-being-nor-non-being."

<!--l. 47882--><p class="indent" >   A Walk in the Woods
<!--l. 47884--><p class="indent" >   by Phra Khantipalo
<!--l. 47886--><p class="indent" >   Come with me for a walk in the woods. It is hot, silent, and nearly midday but
there are patches of shade here and there where we may sit. Around us trees of forty
years are only twenty feet high, so great is the struggle to survive. Many die
young and never mature. You can see their young skeletons being relentlessly
devoured by the termites. Taller trees are scattered here and there, battered
survivors of a continuous fight for life. Many of their limbs have been torn off in
sudden monsoon squalls, or else they have rotted away by fungus and disease
and finally fallen off. You see that "sawdust" about this tree? Its top will
soon fall as some grub is eating away its heartwood. Look over there at that
young tree all askew &#8212; its roots have been attacked by some predator and
so it has been blown over. And there, do you see that large tree, its bark
covered with mud-plaster? The termites are under that gnawing away its
green wood and when they succeed in ringing it all round then, in a single
day, all its leaves will turn yellow and sixty years of growth comes to an
end.
<!--l. 47904--><p class="indent" >   Above us, young leaves of translucent green match their brilliance against the
startling blue sky. Even these young tender leaves are full of holes, delicacies for
the great beetles that bumble about in the evening air. Lower down these
trees, the more mature leaves are ragged and lend to the forest a threadbare
look. Though they must be tough still it seems they are the food of some
insect. Here and there you can see at the base of branches and round the
lower parts of the trees yellow leaves hanging, stiffly awaiting, as it were, the
executioner who will come as a breath of wind and bring them down. Parted,

they are disjoined forever &#8212; one changing process from another changing
process. They fall with a crash among the undergrowth. There they join
hundreds of thousands which fell before them and litter all the ground with a
crackly layer of decay. But they do not just decay slowly at their own speed.
Their decay is quickened by a myriad of ants, termites, worms, and funguses,
all ready for food and fighting to get it, a fearsome underground jungle in
miniature.
<!--l. 47921--><p class="indent" >   A bird calls and is still. Far away the bells on the necks of the water-buffalo at
work in the rice-fields jingle. Insects drone by. You see, insects are always either
looking for food or avoiding becoming the food of others. A breeze sways the
trees and a huge round wasps&#8217; nest at the top of a slender sapling looks
most insecure. Danger! Flies hum and buzz, perching on a bamboo swinging
in constant motion. Cicadas tick, click, and whir far and near as though
they were counting the seconds of their own &#8212; and everyone else&#8217;s &#8212; lives.
Seconds and minutes fly into days and months towards death. A ground lizard
darts for its prey, catches it and chews the living insect with great relish.
Another death in this round where death goes unremarked because it is
everywhere.
<!--l. 47934--><p class="indent" >   Ants swarm everywhere in lines, parties or armies, in all shapes and sizes,
according to their species. They play a great part in the change of this forest for they
are the scavengers. They have only to scent death and they will be there ready to
undertake the dismemberment of the corpse. Sometimes it is still alive. No decay is
uninteresting to them, it is their livelihood and they are always busy for beings never
cease decaying and dying.
<!--l. 47942--><p class="indent" >   Spiders too are found in great variety, all of them ready to pounce on and bite to
death unwary small creatures that become entangled in their shimmering webs. They
hang them, iridescent in the sunlight everywhere and it is a wonder that anything
can fly and yet escape them. But even spiders do not escape death, usually from the
stings of their enemies, the hunting wasps. Though the swaying bough of bamboo
is most graceful it has been marked as part of this menacing world by a
spider&#8217;s web hung among its leaves. And bamboos are cut down by men
for their usefulness. Everything, the beautiful and the ugly is subject to
impermanence.
<!--l. 47953--><p class="indent" >   Clouds pass across the sky bringing coolness to us here below. Their shapes
change from minute to minute. Not even one second the same. They look very solid
yet we know how insubstantial they are. They are just like this present time...
changing... changing...
<!--l. 47958--><p class="indent" >   Look over here in the forest, a pile of ashes and a few burnt-out logs rotting away,
and look: here is another older heap nearly dispersed. And other piles are round
about with occasional carved wooden posts set in the ground, all smoldering. What
are they? These mark the ends of men and women. This forest at the back of
the Wat1 is used for cremation. Some days, if you go in the late afternoon
you will find a group of villagers, and a very simple open-topped coffin.
Everyone can see the body there clothed as he or she died and looking, as
corpses do unless interfered with, quite repulsive. The day of cremation
is the day on which the person died, or the very next day at the latest.

Change sets in fast and hideously in a body kept in the hot countries. A big
pile of logs has been made and without ceremony and with no pretentious
solemnity the coffin is hoisted on top. Bhikkhus having viewed the corpse are
then asked to chant and some gifts are given and dedicated for the good of
the dead man. Then without more ado paraffin is splashed over the pile
and it is set alight. Some stay to see it burn. You can soon see the body
roasting through the flames when the thin-walled coffin has burnt out... until
amidst the embers there are only some charred pieces of bone... "Aniccaa vata
sankaaraa..."
<!--l. 47979--><p class="indent" >   Now the sun, "the eye of the day," has changed his position, or we have changed
ours and our short walk in the woods is nearly over. What have we seen that does
not pass away? Even though I may say that I look out of the windows of my hut
every day and see the same trees, how near to truth is this? How can the trees be the
same? They are steadily changing they are unstable and certain to come to an end in
one way or another. They have had a beginning and they must have an
end.
<!--l. 47988--><p class="indent" >   And what about this "I" who sees these trees, the forest, the burning ground and
so on? Permanent or impermanent? Everyone can answer this question, for we have
seen the answer in the forest. When "I" feel depressed and look at the trees they
seem stark, ugly moth-eaten specimens. But when "I" am glad and look upon them,
see, how beautiful they are! If, while on our walk, we looked only at the
impermanence "out there," now is the time to bring the lesson home to the
heart. Everything that I am is impermanent, unstable, sure to change and
deteriorate.
<!--l. 47999--><p class="indent" >   If impermanence meant change all the time towards better and happier
states how excellent our world would be! But impermanence is allied with
deterioration. All compounds break down, all made things fall to pieces, all
conditioned things pass away with the passing of those conditions. Everything and
everybody &#8212; that includes you and me &#8212; deteriorates, ages, decays, breaks
up, and passes away. And we, living in the forest of desires, are entirely
composed of the impermanent. Yet our desire impels us not to see this, though
impermanence stares us in the face from every single thing around. And it
confronts us when we look within &#8212; mind and body, arising and passing
away.
<!--l. 48011--><p class="indent" >   So don&#8217;t turn on the TV, go to the pictures, read a book, seize some food, or a
hundred other distractions just to avoid seeing this. This is the one thing really worth
seeing, for one who fully sees it in himself is Free.

<!--l. 48022--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhist Doctrine of Anicca (Impermanence)
<!--l. 48024--><p class="indent" >   by Y. Karunadasa, Ph.D. (London)
<!--l. 48026--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhist doctrine of anicca, the transitoriness of all phenomena, finds
classical expression in the oft-recurrent formula: Sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa, and in
the more popular statement: Aniccaa vata sankhaaraa. Both these formulas amount
to saying that all conditioned things or phenomenal processes, mental as well as

material, that go to make up the sa.msaaric plane of existence are transient or
impermanent. This law of impermanence is not the result of any kind of
metaphysical inquiry or of any mystical intuition. It is a straightforward judgment
arrived at by investigation and analysis, and as such its basis is entirely
empirical.
<!--l. 48037--><p class="indent" >   It is in fact for the purpose of showing the insubstantiality and impermanence of
the world of experience that Buddhism analyzes it into a multiplicity of basic factors.
The earliest attempts at explaining this situation are represented in the
analysis into five khandas, twelve aayatanas, and eighteen dhaatus. In the
Abhidhamma we get the most detailed analysis into eighty one basic elements,
which are introduced by the technical term, dhammaa. These are the basic
factors into which the empiric individuality in relation to the external world is
ultimately analyzed. They purport to show that there does not exist a "unity,"
"substance," "atta," or "jiiva." In the ultimate analysis the so-called unity is a
complex of factors, "one" is really "many." This applies to both mind and
matter equally. In the case of living beings there is no soul or self which is
immortal, while in the case of things in general there is no essence which is
ever-perduring.
<!--l. 48054--><p class="indent" >   These basic factors, according to Buddhism, do not imply an absolute unity
(ekatta). They are not fractions of a whole, but a number of co-ordinate ultimates.
Although real they are not permanent. Nor are they mutually unconnected. As such
they do not imply a theory of absolute separateness (puthutta) either. A good
example of this kind of world-view is that of Pakudha Kaccaayana, who seeks to
explain the composition of the world with reference to seven eternally existing and
mutually unconnected substances. This reduces the world to a concatenation of
separate and discrete entities, with no inter-connection, with no inter-dependence.
The Buddhist view of existence does not amount to such an extreme, for according to
Buddhism the basic factors are inter-connected with laws of causation and
conditionality. Thus the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is based both on
analysis and synthesis. It is through analysis that the empirical world is reduced to a
multiplicity of basic factors, and it is through causality that they are again
synthesized.
<!--l. 48071--><p class="indent" >   That existence does not consist of an eternal substance, mental or material, but is
composed of a variety of constantly changing factors is the conclusion that can be
drawn from the analysis into khandhas, aayatanas, dhaatus, and dhammas. On the
impermanence of the five khandhas that make up the empiric individuality,
we find this statement in the Sa.myuttanikaaya: "There is no materiality
whatever, O monks, no feeling, no perception, no formations, no consciousness
whatever that is permanent, ever-lasting, eternal, changeless, identically abiding
for ever." Then the Blessed One took a bit of cowdung in his hand and he
spoke to the monks: "Monks, if even that much of permanent, ever-lasting,
eternal, changeless individual selfhood [attabhaava], identically abiding for
ever, could be found, then this living of a life of purity [brahmacariya] for
the complete eradication of Ill [dukkhakkhaya] would not be feasible" (SN
22.96).
<!--l. 48087--><p class="indent" >   What is revolutionary about the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is that it is

extended to include everything, including consciousness, which is usually taken to be
permanent, as the soul or as one of its qualities. The Majjhima Nikaaya records how
Bhikkhu Saati misunderstood Buddha&#8217;s teaching to mean that consciousness is a
permanent entity, which passes from one existence to another, like the niraasraya
vi~n~naana of the Upanisads. This led the Buddha to formulate the well-known
principle: A~n~natra paccayaa natthi vi~n~naanassa sambhavo &#8212; There is no
arising of consciousness without reference to a condition. This is further explained to
mean that consciousness comes into being (sambhoti) in dependence on a
duality.
<!--l. 48100--><p class="indent" >   What is that duality? It is eye, which is impermanent, changing, becoming-other,
and visible objects, which are impermanent, changing, and becoming-other:
such is the transient, fugitive duality [of eye-cum-visible objects], which
is impermanent, changing, and becoming-other. Eye-consciousness too is
impermanent. For how could eye-consciousness arisen by depending on an
impermanent condition be permanent? The coincidence, concurrence, and
confluence of these three factors which is called contact and those other mental
phenomena arising as a result are also impermanent. (The same formula
is applied to the other sense-organs and the consciousnesses named after
them.)

four-element-made body, rather than citta, to be soul. And why? The body is seen to

for a hundred years or even for longer, while that which is called consciousness, that

night.

<!--l. 48126--><p class="indent" >   Because of its acceptance of this law of universal impermanence, Buddhism stands
in direct opposition to sassatavaada or eternalism, which usually goes hand in hand
with aatmavaada, i.e., belief in some kind of immortal soul. The Brahmajaala Sutta
of the Diighanikaaya alone refers to more than ten varieties of eternalism, only to
refute them as misconceptions of the true nature of the empirical world. But
this refutation of eternalism does not lead to the acceptance, on the part of
Buddhism, of the other extreme, namely ucchedavaada or annihilationism, which
usually goes hand in hand with materialism. The Buddhist refutation of
both these extremes finds classical expression in the following words of the
Buddha:
<!--l. 48138--><p class="indent" >   This world, O Kaccaayana, generally proceeds on a duality, of the "it is" and the
"it is not." But, O Kaccaayana, whoever perceives in truth and wisdom how things
originate in the world, for him there is no "it is not" in this world. Whoever,
Kaccaayana, perceives in truth and wisdom how things pass away in the world, for
him there is no "it is" in this world.
<!--l. 48146--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 12.15
<!--l. 48148--><p class="indent" >   This statement of the Buddha refers to the duality (dvayataa) of existence

(atthitaa) and non-existence (natthitaa). These are the two theories of eternalism
and annihilationism which find expression in many forms in various types of religion
and philosophy. The former implies belief in a permanent and changeless substance or
entity, whether it is conceived as a plurality of individual souls as in Jainism, or as a
monistic world-soul as in Vedaanta, or as a deity of some kind as in most of the
theistic religions. The latter, on the other hand, implies a belief in the temporary
existence of separate souls or personalities which are entirely destroyed or
dissolved after death. A good example of this kind of philosophy is the one
advocated by Ajita Kesakambali which finds mention in the Saama~n~naphala
Sutta.
<!--l. 48162--><p class="indent" >   In contrast, according to Buddhism, everything is the product of antecedent
causes and therefore of dependent origination (pa.ticca-samuppanna). These causes
themselves are not ever-lasting and static, but simply antecedent aspects of the same
ceaseless becoming. Every event is the result of a concatenation of dynamic processes
(sankhaara). Neither Being nor non-Being is the truth. There is only Becoming,
happening by way of cause, continuity without identity, persistence without a
persistent substance. "He who discerns origin by way of cause he discerns
the Dhamma, he who discerns the Dhamma he discerns origin by way of
cause."
<!--l. 48173--><p class="indent" >   Thus by accepting the theory of causation and conditionality, Buddhism
avoids the two extremes of sabba.m atthi (everything is) and sabba.m natthi
(everything is not) and advocates sabba.m bhavati, "everything becomes," i.e.,
happens by way of cause and effect. It is also because of this theory that
Buddhism could avoid the two extremes of niyativaada (determinism) and
ahetu-appaccaya-vaada (indeterminism). According to the former everything is
absolutely pre-determined, according to the latter everything happens without
reference to any cause or condition. According to both there is no room for free will
and as such moral responsibility gets completely ruled out. By its theory of
causation Buddhism avoids both extremes and establishes free will and moral
responsibility.
<!--l. 48186--><p class="indent" >   The second basic characteristic of the world of experience, namely dukkha
(unsatisfactoriness) is but a logical corollary arising from this law of universal
impermanence. For the impermanent nature of everything can but lead to one
inescapable conclusion: As everything is impermanent, they cannot be made the basis
of permanent happiness. Whatever is transient is by that very fact unsatisfactory &#8212;
yad anicca.m ta.m dukkha.m. Since every form of sa.msaaric existence is
impermanent, it is also characterized by unsatisfactoriness. Thus the premise:
"sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa" leads to the conclusion: "sabbe sankhaaraa
dukkhaa."
<!--l. 48197--><p class="indent" >   As indicative of a general characteristic of phenomena, the term dukkha should
not be understood in a narrower sense to mean only pain, suffering, misery, or
sorrow. As a philosophical term it has a wider connotation, as wide as that of the
term anicca. In this wider sense, it includes deeper ideas such as imperfection, unrest,
conflict, in short, unsatisfactoriness. This is precisely why even the states of
jhaana, resulting from the practice of higher meditation and which free from
suffering as ordinarily understood, are also included in dukkha. This is also

why the characterization dukkha is extended even to matter (ruupa). The
Visuddhi-magga of Buddhaghosa recognizes these wider implications of the term
when it explains it as three-fold, namely dukkha-dukkha (dukkha as suffering),
vipari.naama-dukkha (dukkha as change), and sankhaara-dukkha (dukkha as
conditioned state).
<!--l. 48210--><p class="indent" >   As a direct and necessary corollary of this fact of dukkha, we come to the third
basic characteristic of all phenomena, namely anatta, which finds expression in the
well-known statement: Sabbe dhammaa anattaa. For the unsatisfactory nature of
everything should lead to this important conclusion: If everything is characterized by
unsatisfactoriness, nothing can be identified as the self or as a permanent soul
(attaa). What is dukkha (by that very fact) is also anatta. What is not the self
cannot be considered as I am (ahan ti), as mine (maman ti), or as I am that (asmii
ti).
<!--l. 48220--><p class="indent" >   According to Buddhism the idea of self or soul is not only a false and imaginary
belief, with no corresponding objective reality, but is also harmful from an ethical
point of view. For it produces such harmful thoughts of I, me, and mine, selfish
desires, attachments, and all other unwholesome states of mind (akusalaa
dhammaa). It could also be a misery in disguise to one who accepts it as
true:
<!--l. 48227--><p class="indent" >   "Do you see, O bhikkhus, such a soul-theory in the acceptance of which, there
would not arise grief, lamentation, suffering, distress, and tribulation?"
<!--l. 48231--><p class="indent" >   "Certainly not, Sir."
<!--l. 48233--><p class="indent" >   "Good, O bhikkhus, I too, O bhikkhus, do not see a soul-theory, in the acceptance

tribulation."
<!--l. 48237--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; MN 22
<!--l. 48239--><p class="indent" >   This brings into relief the close connection between the Buddhist doctrine of
impermanence and Buddhist ethics: If the world of experience is impermanent, by
that very fact it cannot be made the basis of permanent happiness. What is not
permanent (anicca) and therefore what is characterized by unsatisfactoriness
(dukkha) cannot be considered as the self (anatta). And what is not the self (atta)
cannot be considered as one&#8217;s own (saka) or as a haven of security (taa.na). For the
things that one gets attached to are constantly changing. Hence attachment to
them would only lead to unrest and sorrow. But when one knows things as
they truly are (yathaabhuuta.m), i.e., as anicca, dukkha, and anatta, one
ceases to get agitated by them, one ceases to take refuge in them. Just as
attachment to things is to get fettered by them, even so detachment from
them is to get freed from them. Thus in the context of Buddhist ethics, the
perception of impermanence is only a preliminary step to the eradication
of all cravings, which in turn has the attainment of Nibbaana as its final
goal.
<!--l. 48256--><p class="indent" >   It will thus be seen that the Buddhist doctrine of anicca, on which is also based
the doctrine of dukkha and anatta, can rightly be called the very foundation of the
whole edifice of Buddhist philosophy and ethics. This explains why the Buddha has
declared that the very perception of this fact, namely that whatever comes into
existence is also subject to dissolution (ya.m ki~nci samudaya-dhamma.m sabba.m

ta.m nirodhadhamma.m) is indeed the very arising of the stainless Eye of the
Doctrine (dhamma-cakkhu).
<!--l. 48265--><p class="indent" >   The Theory of Momentariness
<!--l. 48267--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhist doctrine of impermanence, as explained in the canonical texts, does
really amount to a theory of momentariness, in the sense that everything is in a state
of constant flux. This becomes clear from a passage in the Anguttara Nikaaya (AN
3.47), where the three sankhata-lakkha.nas (the characteristics of that which
is compounded) are explained. Here it is said that that which is sankhata
(compounded) has three fundamental characteristics, namely uppaada (origination),
vaya (dissolution), and .thitassa a~n~nathatta (otherwiseness of that which is
existing). From this it follows that the Buddhist doctrine of change should not be
understood in the ordinary sense that something arises, exists for some time in a
more or less static form, and dissolves. On the contrary, the third characteristic,
i.e., .thitassa a~n~nathatta shows that between its arising and cessation, a
thing is all the time changing, with no static phase in between. Thus the
Buddhist doctrine of change does really amount to a theory of universal
flux.
<!--l. 48284--><p class="indent" >   As far as the application of this theory of change is concerned, there is nothing to
suggest that early Buddhism had made any distinction between mind and matter.
However, some schools of Buddhism, notably the Mahaasaanghikas, Vaatsiiputriyas,
and Sammitiiyas, while recognizing the momentary duration of mental elements,
assigned a relative permanence to matter. Others, such as the Sarvaastivaadins,
Mahiisaasakas, and Sautraantikas objected to introducing any such distinction and
declared that all elements of existence, mental as well as material, are of momentary
duration, of instantaneous being.
<!--l. 48294--><p class="indent" >   The Theory of Moment (ksa.na-vaada)
<!--l. 48296--><p class="indent" >   In the various schools of Buddhism the early Buddhist doctrine of change came to
be explained on the basis of a formulated theory of moments. This theory is based on
the three sankhata-lakkha.nas which we referred to earlier. It is in fact on the
interpretation of the third sankhata-lakkha.na, namely .thitassa a~n~nathatta that
the different schools of Buddhism differ widely, as if to justify the very meaning
conveyed by these two words.
<!--l. 48304--><p class="indent" >   The Vaibhaasika School of Buddhism interpret sthityanyathaatva (= .thitassa
a~n~nathatta) as jarataa, postulate another characteristic called sthiti, and thus
increase the number of sankhata-lakkha.nas to four: (i) jaati (origination), (ii) sthitii
(existence), (iii) jarataa (decay), (iv) anityataa (extinction). All elements, mental as
well as material, characterised by them are sa.mskrta (= sankhata). Only aakaasa
(space) and Nirvaana escape from their inexorable sway. At every moment (ksa.na)
all mental and material elements are affected by them. A moment is defined as the
time during which the four characteristics accomplish their operation. The
Vaibhaasikas also maintain that these characteristics are not only distinct from, but
also as real as the things which they characterize &#8212; showing thereby a strong
predilection to naive realism. And in keeping with this theory, it is also
claimed that they are in turn characterized by secondary characteristics
(anulaksa.nas).
<!--l. 48320--><p class="indent" >   The Sautraantika School of Buddhism does not agree with this interpretation of

the Vaibhaasikas. In their view, the four characteristics apply not to one but to a
series of momentary elements: "The series itself is called sthiti (subsistence), its
origin is called jaati, its cessation is vyaya, and the difference in its preceding and
succeeding moments is called sthityanyathaatva" (Abhidharmakosa, III, 78). A
momentary element, so they argue, cannot have a phase called sthiti or jarataa, for
whatever that originates has no time to subsist or decay but to perish. They also
point out that these four characteristics are mere designations with no objective
reality. They criticize the recognition of secondary characteristics on the ground that
this would lead to the fallacy of infinite regress (anavasthaa). For if the four
characteristics require a set of secondary characteristics to account for their
origination, etc., then these secondary characteristics will in turn require another set
of secondary characteristics to account for their origination, etc., and in this manner
the process could be stretched indefinitely. This problem does not arise &#8212; so runs the
argument &#8212; if the characteristics are not recognized as real as the things they
characterize.
<!--l. 48340--><p class="indent" >   How the Theravaadins developed the doctrine of impermanence, and how they
interpreted the sankhata-lakkha.nas could be understood clearly when the subject is
unfolded against this background.
<!--l. 48344--><p class="indent" >   The most striking feature of the Theravada theory is that the fact of
momentariness is explained in quite a different way: Each dhamma (element of
existence) has three moments, namely uppaadakkha.na, the moment of origination;
.thitikkha.na, the moment of subsistence; and bhangakkha.na, the moment of
cessation. These three moments do not correspond to three different dhammas. On
the contrary, they represent three phases &#8212; the nascent, the static, and cessant &#8212; of
one "momentary" dhamma. Hence the statement that dhammas are momentary
means that a given dhamma has three momentary phases or stages. It arises in
the first moment, subsists in the second moment, and perishes in the third
moment.
<!--l. 48356--><p class="indent" >   Like the Sautraantikas, the Theravaadins too accept the fact that a momentary
dhamma has no phase called jarataa or decay. According to the argument of both
schools, the attribution of jarataa, which implies some kind of change or
transformation, to a momentary dhamma is to accept pari.naamavaada, according to
which the essence, the substance remains the same while its modes undergo change.
Change, as it came to be finally defined in the schools of Buddhist logic, is not the
transformation of one and the same dhamma from one stage to another, but the
replacement of one momentary dhamma by another. The following argument in the
Abhidharmakosa, which is directed against the Vaibhaasikas who admit jarataa of
one momentary dhamma, clarifies this situation: "But how can you speak of jarataa
or change in respect of one momentary dhamma? What is called jarataa
or change is the transformation or dissimilarity between two stages. Is it
possible to say that a dharma becomes different from itself. If it remains
unchanged it cannot be another. If it is transformed it is not the same. Therefore
the transformation of one dhamma is not possible" (Abhidharmakosa, III,
56).
<!--l. 48375--><p class="indent" >   Hence the Sautraantikas and the Theravaadins apply the characteristic of jarataa
only to a series of momentary dhammas. In their opinion what is called jarataa is the

difference between the preceding and the succeeding moments of a series. There is,
however, this difference to be noted: Unlike the Sautraantikas, the Theravaadins do
not deny the static phase (.thiti) of a momentary dhamma. The Theravada
argument in support of their accepting the static phase is as follows: It is
true that a dhamma that originates should also cease to exist. But before
it could cease to exist, there should be at least a moment when it turns
towards its own cessation (nirodhaabhimukhaavatthaa). It is this moment when
a dhamma is facing its own cessation that we call the static phase. The
logic of this argument is that a dhamma that arises cannot cease to exist at
the same time, for otherwise existence and non-existence would become
co-existent!
<!--l. 48390--><p class="indent" >   One logical development of this theory of moments is the denial of motion. For, if
all the elements of existence are of momentary duration, they have no time to
move. In the case of momentary elements, wherever appearance takes place
there itself takes place disappearance (yatraivotpattih tatraiva vinaasah). In
keeping with this theory, motion is given a new definition. According to this
definition, motion has to be understood, not as the movement of one material
element from one locus in space to another (desaantara-sa.mkraant), but as the
appearance of momentary elements in adjacent locations (desaantarotpatti),
creating a false picture of movement. The best example given in this case is the
light of the lamp. The so-called light of the lamp, it is argued, is nothing
but a common designation given to an uninterrupted production of a series
of flashing points. When the production changes place one says that the
light has changed. But in reality other flames have appeared in another
place.

the other two, though anattaa, the third, is sometimes founded on dukkha
alone.

<!--l. 48419--><p class="indent" >   Derivations
<!--l. 48421--><p class="indent" >   The adjective anicca (impermanent) is derived in modern etymology
from the negative prefix a- plus nicca (permanent: cf. Vedic Sanskrit nitya
from prefix ni- meaning "onward, downward"). The Paramatthama~njuusaa
(commentary to the Visuddhimagga) and also the Poraana-Tiikaa (one of the three
commentaries to the Abhidhammatthasa"ngaha) agree that "Because it denies
everlastingness, it is not permanent, thus it is impermanent" (na niccan ti anicca.m:
VisA. 125). The Vibhaavinii-Tikaa and Sankhepava.n.nanaa (the other two
commentaries to the Abhs.) prefer a derivation from the negative prefix an-
plus root i to go: "Cannot be gone to, is un-approachable, as a permanent,
everlasting state, thus it is impermanent" (... na iccam, anupagantabban ti
aniccam).
<!--l. 48435--><p class="indent" >   Definitions

<!--l. 48437--><p class="indent" >   Principal definitions given in the Sutta Pi.taka are as follows. "&#8217;Impermanent,
impermanent&#8217; it is said, Lord. What is impermanent?" &#8212; "Materiality [ruupa] is
impermanent, Raadha, and so are feeling [vedanaa] and perception [sa~n~naa] and
formations [sankhaara] and consciousness [vi~n~naa.na]" (SN 23.1). This statement
is summarized by a Canonical commentary thus: "What is impermanent? The five
categories [khandha] are impermanent. In what sense impermanent? Impermanent in
the sense of rise and fall [udaya-vaya]" (Ps. Aanaapaanakathaa/vol. i, 230). Again,
"All is impermanent. And what is the all that is impermanent? The eye
is impermanent, visual objects [ruupaa]... eye-consciousness... eye contact
[cakku-samphassa]... whatever is felt [vedayita] as pleasant or unpleasant
or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, born of eye-contact is impermanent.
[Likewise with the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind]" (SN 35.43/vol. iv, 28) or,
quite succinctly, "All formations are impermanent" (MN 35/vol. i, 230) and
"Whatever is subject to origination [samudaya] is subject to cessation [nirodha]"
(MN 56/vol. i, 380). The Canonical commentary adds "Materiality [etc.] is
impermanent in the sense of exhaustion [khaya]" (Ps. ~Naa.nakathaa/vol. i,
37).
<!--l. 48459--><p class="indent" >   For reasons given below, impermanence in strict Abhidhamma treatment appears,
along with continuity (santati), etc., only as one of the secondary (derivative)
constituents of the materiality category (see e.g., Dhs. &amp; 645), of which the
commentary says "Impermanence of materiality has the characteristic of complete
break-up. Its nature is to make instances of materiality subside. It is manifested as
their exhaustion and fall. Its footing is materiality that is completely breaking up"
(Vis. Ch. XIV/p.450). A section of the Vibha"nga, however, which does not
follow the strict Abhidhamma method, extends impermanence to the highest
kinds of heavenly existence, beyond those with fine-materiality (ruupa) to
the immaterial (aruupa) where there is perception only of infinity of space,
infinity of consciousness, nothingness, or reduced perception of nothingness
(Dhammahadaya-Vibha"nga).
<!--l. 48474--><p class="indent" >   The commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa elaborate the Sutta definitions
further, distinguishing between "the impermanent and the characteristic of
impermanence. The five categories are the impermanent. Why? Because their
essence is to rise and fall and change, and because, after having been, they are
not. But the characteristic of impermanence is their state of rise and fall
and alternation, or it is their mode-transformation [aakaara-vikaara] called
non-being after having been" (Vis. Ch. XXI/p. 640); again "The eye [etc.,]
can be known as impermanent in the sense of its non-being after having
been; and it is impermanent for four reasons as well; because it has rise
and fall, because it changes, because it is temporary, and because it denies
permanence" (VbhA. 41; cf. MA. ad, MN 22/vol. ii, 113), and "Since its destiny is
non-being and since it abandons its natural essence because of the transmission
[of personal continuity] to a new state of being [on rebirth], it is &#8217;subject
to change,&#8217; which is simply synonymous with its impermanence" (VbhA.
49).
<!--l. 48492--><p class="indent" >   Treatment in the Suttas and Commentaries
<!--l. 48494--><p class="indent" >   Having dealt with derivations and definitions, we can now turn to the Suttas and

commentaries again in order to see how this subject is handled there; for in this
article we shall be mainly concerned with quotations, leaving discussion to other
articles.
<!--l. 48499--><p class="indent" >   But at this point, it is convenient to approach the doctrine of impermanence first
from the point of view of it as a description of what actually is (yathaa-bhuuta),
leaving till later the point of view of it as a basis for evaluation and judgment, which
is the reason and justification for the description.
<!--l. 48505--><p class="indent" >   Impermanence is observable empirically and is objectively and publicly evident,
always if looked for, and from time to time forcing itself upon our notice. Externally
it is found in the inconstancy of "things," which extends even to the periodical
description of world-systems (see e.g., MN 28; SN 15.20; AN 7.62); and in one self it
can be observed, for instance, in the body&#8217;s inadequacy (aadiinava) because it ages, is
prone to sickness, dies, and gradually decays after death (see MN 13); life is
short (AN 7.70). But "it would be better for an untaught ordinary man
to treat as self [attaa] this body, which is constructed upon the four great
entities [mahaa-bhuuta], then cognizance [citta]. Why? Because this body
can last one year, two years,... even a hundred years; but what is called
&#8217;cognizance&#8217; and &#8217;mind&#8217; [mano] and &#8217;consciousness&#8217; [vi~n~naa.na] rises and
ceases differently through night and day, just as a monkey ranging through a
forest seizes a branch, and, letting that go, seizes another" (SN 12.61/vol. ii,
94.5).
<!--l. 48522--><p class="indent" >   Nevertheless observance of empirical impermanence might not alone suffice for
the radical position accorded by the Buddha to this characteristic. This is
established, however, by discovery, through reasoned attention, of a regular
structure in the subjective-objective process of its occurrence: "This body [for
example] is impermanent, it is formed [sa.nkhata], and it is dependently-arisen
[pa.ticca-samuppanna]" (SN 36.7/vol. iv, 211; cf. SN 22.21/vol. iii, 24). Here, in fact,
three aspects are distinguished, three necessary and interlocking constituents of
impermanence, namely (1) change, (2) formation (as "this, not that," without which
no change could be perceived), and (3) a recognizable pattern in a changing process
(also called "specific conditionality" (idapaccayataa), which pattern is set out in the
formula of dependent origination (pa.ticca-samuppaada). We shall take these three
aspects in order.
<!--l. 48538--><p class="indent" >   (1)
<!--l. 48540--><p class="indent" >   There is no single treatise on the characteristic of impermanence either in the
Tipi.taka or its commentaries, and so we shall have to bring together passages from a
number of sources. We may also bear in mind that the Buddha does not confine
descriptions of a general nature such as this to the observed alone, but extends them
to include the observer, regarded as actively committed in the world he observes and
acting on it as it acts on him, so long as craving and ignorance remain unabolished.
"That in the world by which one perceives the world [loka-sa~n~nii] and
conceives concepts about the world [loka-maanii] is called &#8217;the world&#8217; in
the Ariyas&#8217;s Discipline. And what is it in the world with which one does

called &#8217;world&#8217; [loka]" (SN 35.82/vol. iv, 52). That impermanence is not only

appropriate to all of any arisen situation but also to the totality of all arisen
situations:

<!--l. 48610--><p class="indent" >   This leads us to the second of the three aspects, that of the formation mentioned

"Bhikkhus, there are three formed characteristics of the formed: arising is
evident and fall is evident and the alteration of what is present [.thitassa
a~n~nathattam] is evident" (AN 3.47/vol. i, 152). And one who possesses the
Five Factors of Endeavor [padhaaniya"nga] "has understanding, possesses
understanding [pa~n~naa] extending to rise and disappearance" (DN 33/ vol. iii,
237).

<!--l. 48622--><p class="indent" >   Acariya Buddhaghosa makes use of the empirically observable in order to arrive
at the radical concept of rise and fall. A cup gets broken (VbhA. 49); the asoka tree&#8217;s
shoot can be seen to change in the course of a few days from pale to dark red and
then through brown to green leaves, which eventually turn yellow, wither, and fall to
the ground (Vis. Ch. xx/p. 625). The illustration of a lighted lamp is also
used; where it goes to when its oil and wick are used up no one knows... But
that is crudely put; for the flame in each third portion of the wick as it
gradually burns away ceases there without reaching the other parts... That is
crudely put too; for the flame in each inch, in each half-inch, in each thread, in
each strand, will cease without reaching the other strands; but no flame
can appear without a strand (Vis. Ch. xx/p. 622). By regarding seeming
stability in ever shorter periods and minuter detail, a momentary view is
arrived at. Anything whatever, first analyzed into a five-category situation, is
then regarded as arising anew in each moment (kha.na) and immediately
dissolving, "like sesamum seeds crackling when put into a hot pan" (Vis.
Ch. xx/pp. 622, 626). This is further developed in the commentary to the
Visuddhimagga:
<!--l. 48642--><p class="indent" >   Formed [sa"nkhata] dhammas&#8217; arising by means of cause and condition, their
coming to be after not being, their acquisition of individuality [attabhaava], is their
rise. Their instantaneous cessation and exhaustion when arisen is their fall. Their
other state through aging is their alteration. For just as when the occasion [avatthaa]
of arising dissolves and the occasion of dissolution [bha"nga] succeeds it,
there is no break in the basis [vatthu] on the occasion facing dissolution,
in other words, presence [.thiti], which is what the term of common usage
&#8217;aging&#8217; refers to, so too it is necessary that the aging of a single dhamma is
meant, which is what is called &#8217;momentary [instantaneous] aging.&#8217; And there
must, without reservation, be no break in the basis between the occasions of
arising and dissolution, otherwise it follows that one [thing] arises and another
dissolves.

<!--l. 48658--><p class="indent" >   Acariya Buddhaghosa, though not identifying being with being-perceived rejects

thus:

unarisen mentality-materiality [naama-ruupa] [existing] prior to its arising. When it
arises, it does not come from any heap or store; and when it ceases, it does
not go in any direction. There is nowhere any depository in the way of a
heap or store, prior to its arising, of the sound that arises when a lute is
played, nor does it come from any store when it arises, nor does it go in
any direction when it has ceased [cf. SN 35.205/vol. iv, 197], but on the
contrary, not having been, it is brought into being by depending on the lute, the
lute&#8217;s soundboard, and a man&#8217;s appropriate effort, and immaterial [aruupa]
dhammas come to be [with the aid of specific conditions], and having been, they
vanish.

<!--l. 48677--><p class="indent" >   The transience and perpetual renewal of dhammas is compared in the

same work (Ch. xx/p. 633) to dewdrops at sunrise, a bubble on water, a
line drawn on water (AN 4.37), a mustard seed on an awl&#8217;s point, and a
lightning flash (Mahaa Niddesa p. 42), and they are as coreless (nissaara)
as a conjuring trick (SN 22.95/vol. iii, 142), a mirage (Dhp 46), a dream
(Sn 4.6/v. 807), a whirling firebrand&#8217;s circle (alaata cakka), a goblin city
(gandhabba-nagara), froth (Dhp 46), a plantain trunk (SN 22.95/vol. iii, 141), and so
on.
<!--l. 48686--><p class="indent" >   Before leaving the aspect of rise and fall, the question of the extent (addhaana) of
the moment (kha.na), as conceived in the commentaries, must be examined (The
Abhidhamma mentions the kha.na without specifying any duration). A Sutta cited
above gave "arising, fall, and alteration of what is present" as three characteristics of
anything formed. In the commentaries this is restated as "rise, presence, and
dissolution" (uppaada-.thiti-bha"nga; see e.g., Vis. Ch. xx/p. 615), which are each
also called "[sub-] moments" (kha.na). These sub-moments are discussed in the
Vibha"nga commentary:
<!--l. 48697--><p class="indent" >   To what extent does materiality last? And to what extent the [mental]
immaterial? Materiality is heavy to change and slow to cease; the immaterial is light
to change and quick to cease. Sixteen cognizances arise and cease while [one instance
of] materiality lasts; but that ceases with the seventeenth cognizance. It is
like when a man wanting to knock down some fruit hits a branch with a
mallet, and when fruits and leaves are loosed from their stems simultaneously;
and of those the fruits fall first to the ground because they are heavier, the
leaves later because they are lighter. So too, just as the leaves and fruits are
loosed simultaneously from their stems with the blow of the mallet, there is
simultaneous manifestation of materiality and immaterial dhammas at the moment
of relinking [pa.tisandhi] at rebirth... And although there is this difference
between them, materiality cannot occur without the immaterial nor can the
immaterial without materiality: they are commensurate. Here is a simile: there
is a man with short legs and a man with long legs; as they journey along
together, while long-legs takes one step short-legs takes sixteen steps; when
short-legs is making his sixteenth step, long-legs lifts his foot, draws it forward
and makes a single step; so neither out-distances the other, and they are
commensurate.
<!--l. 48718--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Khandha-Vibha"nga A/Vbh. 25-6
<!--l. 48720--><p class="indent" >   Elsewhere it is stated that the sub-moments of arising and dissolution are
equal for both materiality and cognizance, only the presence sub-moment of
materiality being longer. The Muula-Tiikaa, however, puts the mental presence
sub-moment in question, commenting as follows on the passage just quoted:
"Now it needs investigating whether there is what is here called &#8217;presence
sub-moment&#8217; of a cognizance or not." It cites the Citta Yamaka as follows "Is it,
when arisen, arising? At the dissolution sub-moment it is arisen but it is not
not arising" and "Is it, when not arising, not arisen? At the dissolution
sub-moment it is not arising, but it is not unarisen" (Y. ii, 13) and two similar
passages from the same source (Y. ii, 14), pointing out that only the dissolution
sub-moment is mentioned instead of both, that and the presence sub-moment, as
might be expected, had the Yamaka regarded the presence sub-moment as

having valid application to cognizance. For that reason, the Muula-Tiikaa
concludes:
<!--l. 48737--><p class="indent" >   [The] non-existence of a presence sub-moment of cognizance is indicated. For
although it is said in the Suttas "The alteration of what is present is evident" [AN
3.47/vol. i, 152], that does not mean either that a continuity alteration which is
evident cannot be called "presence" [.thiti] because of absence of any alteration of
what is one only, or that what is existent [vijjamaana] by possessing the
pair of sub-moments [of arising and dissolution] cannot be called "present"
[.thita].

<!--l. 48749--><p class="indent" >   (3)
<!--l. 48751--><p class="indent" >   The third aspect of impermanence, that of the pattern or structure of specific
conditionality, still remains. It is briefly stated thus "That comes to be when there is
this; that arises with the arising of this, That does not come to be when this is not;
that ceases with the cessation of this" (MN 38/vol. i, 262-4), or in the words that
first awakened the two Chief Disciples: "A Tathaagata has told the cause of dhammas
that have come into being due to a cause, and that which brings their cessation too:
such is the doctrine preached by the Great Sama.na" (Mv. Kh. 1). In more detail we
find: "Consciousness acquires being [sambhoti] by dependence on a duality. What is
that duality? It is eye, which is impermanent, changing, becoming-other, and visible
objects, which are impermanent, changing, and becoming-other: such is the
transient, fugitive duality [of eye-cum-visible objects], which is impermanent,
changing, and becoming-other. Eye-consciousness is impermanent, changing,
and becoming-other; for this cause and condition [namely, eye-cum-visible
objects] for the arising of eye-consciousness being impermanent, changing, and
becoming-other, how could eye-consciousness, arisen by depending on an
impermanent condition be permanent? Then the coincidence, concurrence and
confluence of these three impermanent dhammas is called contact [phassa]; but
eye-contact too is impermanent, changing, and becoming-other; for how could
eye-contact, arisen by depending on an impermanent condition, be permanent? It
is one touched by contact who feels [vedeti], likewise who chooses [ceteti],
likewise who perceives [sa~njaanaati]; so these transient, fugitive dhammas
too [namely, feeling, choice, and perception] are impermanent, changing,
and becoming-other." (The same treatment is accorded to ear-cum-sounds,
nose-cum-odors, tongue-cum-flavors, body-cum-tangibles, and mind-cum-ideas:
SN 35.93/vol. iv, 67-8). By further development we come to the formula of
dependent origination (pa.ticca-samuppaada); but that is beyond the scope of this

impermanence. There that contemplation introduces the first of what are called the
"Eight Knowledges" (a classification peculiar to the Visuddhimagga), namely, the
knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall (udayabbayaanupassanaa-~naa.na). Also

<!--l. 49096--><p class="indent" >   The present volume on anattaa concludes the treatment of The Three Basic Facts
of Existence (or The Three Characteristics) within The Wheel series. Though the
Buddha&#8217;s teaching on not-self has been treated quite often in these publications it
was felt that some more material from sources not easily accessible to the general
reader should be offered here. From different angles, these essays and translations will
throw light on that central teaching of Buddhism, anattaa. As the earlier books on
anicca and dukkha, this volume, too, concludes with a concise and systematic
treatment of the subject by the late venerable 혀namoli Thera, which is a valuable
guide to the source material as well as to a deeper study of this profound
doctrine.
<!--l. 49108--><p class="indent" >   The diverse renderings chosen by the individual authors for the key term anattaa
or nairaatmya (Skt.) have been retained. Hence it should be understood by the
reader that egolessness, soullessness, impersonality and not-self all stand for the Pali
term anattaa (Sanskrit: anaatma or nairaatmya).

<!--l. 49118--><p class="indent" >   by Nyanatiloka Mahathera
<!--l. 49120--><p class="indent" >   More and more the noble teaching at the Buddha seems to be on the way to
conquer the world. More than ever before, the Buddhists are working for its
propagation in nearly all the countries of the earth. Especially in India, the
birth place of Buddhism, whence it disappeared for nearly a thousand years,
Buddhism has again made its entrance and gained a firm footing, and with
rapid strides it is ever gaining more and more ground. One therefore should
rather think it a good omen that India, having regained its independence, has
adopted as its emblem the Buddhist Four-Lion symbol of Emperor Asoka, and
that, at the proclamation of the Indian Republic, behind the presidential

throne, crowned with this Buddhist emblem, there appeared the Buddha&#8217;s
statue.
<!--l. 49133--><p class="indent" >   Also all over Europe and America a mighty Buddhist wave is set in motion, which
no longer can be kept back and suppressed and which, sooner or later, will flood the
world with its beneficial influence. The world is no longer satisfied with dogmas based
on blind belief. Everywhere in the world there is found today a striving for freedom
and independence, externally and internally; and ever more the thinking man feels
that the destinies of beings are not dependent on the omnipotence and infinite
goodness of an imaginary creator, but that they rest entirely on the beings
themselves. It is in Buddhism that one may find the true answers to many of the
problems that are troubling men, and which they wish to get solved. Everybody
knows that Buddhism is not a revealed religion and not based on blind belief, but
that it is a doctrine to be realized by man&#8217;s own understanding, a doctrine that
makes man free and independent in his thinking, and assures him of happiness and
peace.
<!--l. 49149--><p class="indent" >   But of one thing I wish to warn all those who are working for the propagation
of Buddhism, namely: not to allow themselves to be influenced or carried
away by seemingly identical theosophical, Christian, or what is still worse,
materialistic teachings. For all these are, in essence and substance, very
often diametrically opposed to the Buddha&#8217;s doctrines and prevent a real
understanding and realization of the profound law discovered and proclaimed by the
Buddha.
<!--l. 49157--><p class="indent" >   The most crucial point for most men seems to be the Buddha&#8217;s fundamental
teaching of phenomenality, egolessness and impersonality of existence, in Pali
anattaa. It is the middle way between two extremes, namely on the one hand the
spiritualistic belief in an eternal ego-entity, or soul, outlasting death; on the other
hand the materialistic belief in a temporary ego-entity becoming annihilated at
death.
<!--l. 49164--><p class="indent" >   Therefore it is said: There are three teachers in the world. The first teacher
teaches the existence of an eternal ego-entity outlasting death: that is the Eternalist,
as for example the Christian. The second teacher teaches a temporary ego-entity
which becomes annihilated at death: that is the annihilationist, or materialist. The
third teacher teaches neither an eternal, nor a temporary ego-entity: this is the
Buddha. The Buddha teaches that, what we call ego, self, soul, personality etc., are
merely conventional terms not referring to any real independent entity. And he
teaches that there is only to be found this psychophysical process of existence
changing from moment to moment. Without understanding the egolessness of
existence, it is not possible to gain a real understanding of the Buddha-word;
and it is not possible without it to realize that goal of emancipation and
deliverance of mind proclaimed by the Buddha. This doctrine of egolessness
of existence forms the essence of the Buddha&#8217;s doctrine of emancipation.
Thus with this doctrine of egolessness, or anattaa, stands or falls the entire
Buddhist structure. Indeed, for anyone who wishes to engage in the study of the
Buddhist scriptures, the best thing would be, from the very start, to get himself
acquainted with the two methods, in which the Buddha taught the Dhamma
to the world. The first method is the teaching in conventional language;

the second method is the teaching in philosophically correct language. The
first one relates to conventional truth, the second, to truth in the ultimate
sense.
<!--l. 49188--><p class="indent" >   Thus, whenever the Buddha uses such terms as I, person, living being, etc., this is
to be understood as conventional speech, hence not correct in the highest sense. It
is just as speaking of the rising and setting of the sun, though we know
thoroughly well that this does not correspond to reality. Thus the Buddha teaches
that, in the ultimate sense, amongst all these psychophysical phenomena of
existence there cannot be found any eternal or even temporary ego-entity,
and hence that all existence of whatever kind is something impersonal, or
anattaa.
<!--l. 49197--><p class="indent" >   In this connection I would like to emphasize the fact that this fundamental
doctrine of egolessness and emptiness is not, as some misinformed Western Buddhists
assert, only taught in the southern school of Buddhism, but that even in the
so-called the Mahayana schools it forms a most essential part. Without this
teaching of anattaa, or egolessness, there is no Buddhism; and without having
realized the truth of egolessness no real progress is possible on the path to
deliverance.
<!--l. 49205--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha is, in every respect, a teacher at the golden mean, ethically as well as
philosophically. From the ethical standpoint, for example, the Buddha rejects two
extremes: the way of sensual pleasures and the way of self-torture. From the
philosophical standpoint he rejects eternity, as well as temporariness of an ego entity.
Just so he rejects belief in an absolute identity and an absolute otherness of the
various stages of the process of existence. He rejects the determinism, as
well as the belief in chance. He rejects the belief in absolute existence and
absolute non-existence; likewise in freedom of will, as well as in unfreedom of
will.
<!--l. 49216--><p class="indent" >   All these things will become clear to one who understands the egolessness and
conditioned nature of all phenomena of existence. On the understanding of these two
truths depends the understanding of the entire doctrine of the Buddha. Hence the
understanding and final penetration of the egolessness and conditionedness of all
phenomena of existence are the necessary foundation to the realization of the noble
eightfold path leading to deliverance from all vanity and misery, namely:
right understanding, right thought, right speech, right bodily action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration of mind. Only
this golden middle path, based on these two kinds of right understanding,
namely of "egolessness and conditionedness," can alleviate and destroy these
vain illusions of "self" and craving, which are the root-causes of all war and
bloodshed in the world. But without these two kinds of understanding there is
no realization of the holy and peaceful goal pointed out by the Buddha.
There are however, to be found various would-be Buddhists in the West who
are attached to an imaginary Great Self, and who uphold that the Buddha
did in no way reject the view of an "eternal Atman," or soul, behind and
independent of the phenomena of existence, and who believe that the Mahayana
texts teach such a doctrine. Such assertions, however, do not in the least
prove correct, for neither do the Pali texts, nor the early Mahayana texts

proclaim an eternal self. Any reader, who is unbiased in mind and free from
prejudices, can never from a study of the Buddhist scriptures come to the
conclusion that the Buddha ever taught any such ego-entity within or outside the
corporeal, mental and spiritual phenomena of existence. Nowhere in the
world can there be found such an entity, as was clearly pointed out by the
Buddha.
<!--l. 49245--><p class="indent" >   Regarding the questions whether the Holy One will continue after death, or not
continue etc., the Buddha says that all such questions are wrongly put. And why?
Because what is called the "Holy One" is here only a conventional term and refers to
no real entity while in reality there is only to be found a process of corporeal, mental,
and spiritual phenomena. In another text, therefore the Buddhist asks a monk,
whether he considered corporeality as the Holy One, or the feelings, or the
perceptions, or the mental formations, or consciousness. Or whether he believed
the Holy One to exist within these five groups of phenomena or outside
thereof. Or whether all these phenomena heaped together were the Holy
One. And denying all these questions, the Buddha further said that, even
during lifetime, the Holy One could not be discovered in reality, and that
therefore it would be wrong to ask whether the Holy One will continue or
not continue after death, etc. Thus, no entities are existing in the world,
but only ever-changing processes. The Buddha further says: Only because
man does not understand corporeality, feeling and the other mental and
spiritual phenomena being impermanent, unsatisfactory and impersonal
(aniccaa, dukkha, and anattaa), and does not understand their conditioned
origin, their extinction, and the path leading to their extinction, therefore
he will think that the Holy One does continue, or does not continue after
death etc. This, therefore, is the reason why the Buddha did not answer such
questions.
<!--l. 49269--><p class="indent" >   According to Buddhism, the whole of existence is comprised in the five groups of
phenomena mentioned above, or still more briefly expressed in the three groups:
corporeality, consciousness, and the mental factors. And within these three groups
are comprised the only and ultimate things given, though also these again are mere
fleeting and evanescent phenomena, flashing up for a moment, in order to disappear
immediately thereafter forever. Thus whenever in the Buddhist scriptures mention is
made of I, self, living being, etc., even of the Buddha, these expressions
accordingly are used merely as conventional terms, without referring to any
real entities. Therefore the Buddha has said: "It is impossible, it cannot be
that a man with real understanding should ever consider anything as a real
entity."
<!--l. 49282--><p class="indent" >   He who does not understand the egolessness of existence, and who still attached
to ego-illusion, such a one cannot comprehend and understand the four Noble Truths
of the Buddha in the true light.
<!--l. 49286--><p class="indent" >   These four truths are:
<!--l. 49288--><p class="indent" >   the truth of the impermanency, unsatisfactoriness and impersonality of
existence;
<!--l. 49291--><p class="indent" >   the truth that repeated rebirth and misery are rooted in self-illusion and craving
for existence;

<!--l. 49294--><p class="indent" >   the truth that through the extinction of all self-illusion vanity, and craving,
deliverance from all rebirth will be attained;
<!--l. 49297--><p class="indent" >   the truth that the eightfold path, based on right understanding, is the path
leading to this goal.
<!--l. 49300--><p class="indent" >   He who has not penetrated the ego-illusion and is still attached to self-vanity will
believe that it is he himself that suffers, will believe that is he himself that performs
the good and evil deeds leading to his rebirth, that it is he himself that
will enter Nirvana, that is he himself that will bring the eightfold path to
perfection.
<!--l. 49306--><p class="indent" >   Whoso, however, has fully penetrated the egolessness of existence, knows that,
in the highest sense, there is no individual that suffers, that commits the
kammic deeds, that enters Nirvana, and that brings the Eightfold Path to
perfection.
<!--l. 49311--><p class="indent" >   In the Visuddhi Magga it is therefore said:
<!--l. 49313--><p class="indent" >   Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found. The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds
is there, Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it. The path is, but no traveller on it
is seen.
<!--l. 49317--><p class="indent" >   Therefore, wherever the doctrine of the egolessness of all existence is rejected,
there the Buddha&#8217;s word is rejected. But wherever, through penetration of the
egolessness of all existence, the ego-vanity has reached ultimate extinction, there the
goal of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching has been realized, namely: freedom from all vanity of I
and Mine, and the highest peace of Nibbaana.
<!--l. 49324--><p class="indent" >   Self
<!--l. 49326--><p class="indent" >   by G.N. Lewis
<!--l. 49328--><p class="indent" >   If something is yours you have power over it; you can make it into whatever you
wish. It will change according to your plans.
<!--l. 49331--><p class="indent" >   But have you power over your self? Can you make your body larger or smaller or
let it be this or that as you desire?
<!--l. 49334--><p class="indent" >   If it is not governed by your power but by its own laws and processes then it is
not yours. If it were the body would not be involved in sickness for you would be able
to make it be whatever you wished. Admittedly one has control over the body to an
extent but not as much as one has over this house or any other possession.
Why?
<!--l. 49340--><p class="indent" >   Your body was once very much more delicate and smaller than it is now. Now it is
bigger and stronger. It will get weaker and degenerate later on. This body
which you call yours &#8212; has it developed and deteriorated according to your
will? Or perhaps the question of ownership does not arise &#8212; the body being
subject to the same laws of nature as everything else, i.e., birth, decay, and
death.
<!--l. 49347--><p class="indent" >   If this is so, should one be concerned or unconcerned regarding the body? If
neglected, the natural processes of destruction act quickly, disease and death soon
resulting. Therefore food, exercise, and clothing must be used to maintain it and to
stop the natural processes being accelerated.
<!--l. 49353--><p class="indent" >   Do people feed and dress the body for maintenance only, and, if not, why? Take a
person who dresses only to keep his body protected from the elements. What&#8217;s wrong
with this? Should he be criticized and, if he is, for what? Because others don&#8217;t dress

similarly doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s doing something wrong. Someone may say he looks ugly
and unsightly but how did we learn what ugliness was in the first place?
Is the person criticizing him or his clothes? Well, "him" is not the body;
the person criticizing him is not taking offense at the body but just at the
clothes.
<!--l. 49363--><p class="indent" >   This is where opinion together with vanity creep in and facts become
concealed.
<!--l. 49366--><p class="indent" >   Leaving the body let us turn to another aspect of self &#8212; feeling.
<!--l. 49369--><p class="indent" >   Say a man tries to grasp something which continually slips through his fingers.
Can he say that thing is his? He tries to keep it but he can never clutch it solidly and
he would never dream of calling that thing his own.
<!--l. 49374--><p class="indent" >   But say he has a fountain pen. That really seems to be his own. It is always with
him and it keeps its shape and doesn&#8217;t change very much.
<!--l. 49378--><p class="indent" >   How about feelings &#8212; happiness, indifference, and pain? Are not these like the
first example? How can we ever say feelings are our own? If they were, happiness
would be ours for the rest of our life and not an illusive thing which comes and goes
against our wishes.
<!--l. 49384--><p class="indent" >   Body is born, it decays and dies. Likewise we find on investigation that exactly
the same is true for feelings. The body does not come from nothing. It starts off by
the fusing of two cells from mother and father. By way of nourishment it grows and
develops. Then it dies.
<!--l. 49389--><p class="indent" >   Feeling is born of sense-impingement; e.g., eye and material shape lead to sense
impingement, which leads to visual consciousness which leads to feeling &#8212; pleasant,
indifferent or painful according to whether or not what has been seen is liked or
disliked as a result of past experience.
<!--l. 49395--><p class="indent" >   Thus we see how feeling is born. But this feeling changes. If a painful feeling
arises we are not content but crave to get away from it. Alternatively if we have
perceived something that gives a pleasing feeling we long to keep this feeling and try
to possess whatever has caused it to arise.
<!--l. 49401--><p class="indent" >   Why don&#8217;t feelings last? Because the very things from which they arise do not
last. Therefore if we do not grasp after feelings we never suffer. Feelings are
continually born and continually die but the body takes a long time to do
so.
<!--l. 49406--><p class="indent" >   If we cannot call body our own, how much less so is this true of feelings?
<!--l. 49408--><p class="indent" >   Let us now examine a third aspect of ourselves &#8212; perception.
<!--l. 49410--><p class="indent" >   What do we perceive and is it we who actually perceive? Perception is the
recognition of sense-impingements. How is it born?
<!--l. 49413--><p class="indent" >   I hear a loud noise and recognize that a door has been slammed. What is
the basis of this recognition? Firstly, without the ear no sound would be
heard; therefore the ear is a necessary basis. The sound impinges on the
year, this being sensory impingement. From this perception arises, but like
feelings it does not last and soon dies away, another rising in its place. Do I
enter into this perception? Do I perceive the door slamming? No. We have
definitely seen that perception arose of its own accord, with oneself not being
involved at all. Well, if body, feeling and perception are not "me," what
is?

<!--l. 49424--><p class="indent" >   Before this can be answered there is yet another aspect of ourselves and this is
volitional action. Here surely we shall find our true self. I say to a friend "I am going
to do that" and I keep to what I&#8217;ve said. Here it appears a deliberate choice has been
made between doing two specific things: either I will or I won&#8217;t. How does the will or
act of choosing arise, or is it there all the time? Does it only come into force
when we have to make a choice? On investigation we find that this is so; for
example: I&#8217;m going to ride my bicycle tonight. This is a deliberate choice.
I could have gone to the cinema or for a walk. Why did I choose riding?
Does volition come into this at all? What other volitional tendencies are
there?
<!--l. 49437--><p class="indent" >   I have killed a man. Surely volition was there. But if I ask myself why I wanted to
kill him, several interesting things come to light. For argument&#8217;s sake let us say he
murdered my wife. I was very attached to her. He took something away from me
which I wanted. Missing the pleasurable feelings which were continually aroused by
my wife&#8217;s company, a painful feeling took its place when I lost her and I craved to get
the former feeling back. The only satisfaction for me was to get rid of the object
(the man) which caused the painful feeling to arise and therefore I killed
him.
<!--l. 49447--><p class="indent" >   So we see from this example that the volitional drive (the desire to kill) had a
basis for arising and we see also that after arising it passed away on completion of its
primary object (the death of a man).
<!--l. 49452--><p class="indent" >   Volition therefore is a conditioned force directed specifically toward something,
e.g., I can arouse myself to apply my mind to something. But, as just proved, volition
is a conditioned phenomenon. Can I therefore be equated with volition? If so,
I only exist when volition is present; when it passes away I die also. But
we say we are present all the time &#8212; therefore I cannot be equated with
volition.
<!--l. 49459--><p class="indent" >   In conclusion we can state that if I say, "I&#8217;m going to do this or that," what this
really means is that this or that is going to be done, not by me but through cause
and necessity.
<!--l. 49464--><p class="indent" >   Well, we still have not found ourselves; yet there is only one more aspect of
ourselves to consider &#8212; consciousness.
<!--l. 49467--><p class="indent" >   Are you conscious, am I conscious? "Yes," is the usual immediate answer. If this
were not so you would say, "I&#8217;d be unconscious." Can you be conscious without being
conscious of anything? Most people would say not. Let us find out what are the
factors involved in being conscious.
<!--l. 49473--><p class="indent" >   Can one be conscious without a body? Not that we know of, so we can assume
from this that consciousness arises dependent on the body. Will there be
consciousness if no sense-organs are in the body? We can categorically state that
there will not be. So our second step is that consciousness is dependent on the
sense-organs. Will there be consciousness with body and sense-organs and
no internal or external sense-impingement? Again we can say definitely,
"No." Given sense-impingement shall we be conscious? Yes, but it will not be
a very meaningful consciousness. We shall see a conglomeration of colors,
hear noises, smell things, have bodily sensations, and taste things, but not
be able to recognize them. If perception is missing one cannot say, "I am

conscious."
<!--l. 49486--><p class="indent" >   We have already discussed perception and shown that it is not one&#8217;s real self.
Sense-consciousness, together with perception, gives us our awareness of things, but
is there an "I" who is aware? If you say, "I am conscious of a vase of flowers on the
table," are you really conscious of it? By our investigation we have tried to show that
you do not enter into is at all and that consciousness, like all the other aspects of self,
has birth, decay, and death.
<!--l. 49495--><p class="indent" >   To fall into the delusion that the body, feelings, perception, volitional action, and
consciousness are you is to suffer because unfortunately they are not of you and you
are not of them, and you cannot expect them ever to give satisfaction for very
long.
<!--l. 49500--><p class="indent" >   In conclusion I would say that the more disgusted one becomes with compounded
things the closer one gets to things that give lasting happiness.

<!--l. 49507--><p class="indent" >   Physical and Biological Aspects of Anattaa
<!--l. 49509--><p class="indent" >   by Edward Greenly
<!--l. 49511--><p class="indent" >   The labors of a succession of devoted scholars, from Turnour to Rhys Davids, has
now made impossible, at any rate for all serious students of religion, the cruder
misconceptions of Buddhism that were current in Europe at the end of last
century. Its deeply intellectual character, its unique and unsullied record
of tolerance, its priority (relatively to the Mediterranean systems) of five
centuries in promulgation of the higher ethic, all these things are now widely
known.
<!--l. 49519--><p class="indent" >   And yet in spite of all this, even among such as are devoid of prejudice, it is
seldom that one meets with a real, penetrating understanding of the Teaching. To
some its philosophy, to others its influence, appear alike unintelligible.
<!--l. 49524--><p class="indent" >   Now the source of this perplexity, it may safely be affirmed, is, invariably, a
failure to apprehend that characteristic and central doctrine or principle of Buddhism
that is summed up in the Pali term anattaa. Without this, there must appear to be
an unbridgeable gap in the Buddhist doctrine of causation, its power over the hearts
and lives of men must seem incapable of explanation, its final goal still present the
insoluble enigma that it has for long presented to the European mind. Anattaa
once comprehended, however, all whether thought or practice, is clear and
open.
<!--l. 49534--><p class="indent" >   The term is generally explained as meaning "denial of the soul"; and yet such a
translation is apt to be somewhat misleading to a European. For it involves, in
a certain sense, both less and more than that. It does not by any means
imply, for example, that "death ends all" in the sense of some of the Western
schools. And on the other hand, the idea of a "soul" is but a part, though
indeed the most important part, of the great body of conceptions which it
denies.
<!--l. 49543--><p class="indent" >   Taken in connection with aniccaa, the principle of impermanence, that which it
denies is the idea of separate and abiding substance in anything whatever in the
whole unbounded universe, whether psychical or physical. Psyche, of course, was the
particular kind of substance which the Buddhist teachers had in view, and its proper
treatment is, naturally, psychological. But every kind of substance comes under

the same condemnation; and, as the Western mind of today is far more at
home in, and thinks far more clearly and powerfully upon, physical affairs, a
consideration of some of the physical and biological aspects of anattaa is likely to
be the best possible preparation for an understanding of those psychical
aspects of it which the Buddhist teachers so earnestly labored to convey,
the more so as such cases are, it should most clearly be understood, not
"illustrations" or analogies only; they are actual examples of the principle
itself.
<!--l. 49558--><p class="indent" >   Consider such a phenomenon as a rainbow. To the unsophisticated mind, a
rainbow is just as real as any other object, much more vivid and real than the faint
and distant hills that lie beyond it. A child, indeed, filled with longing, will beg that
it may be given to him, that he may have and hold and possess for himself this
beautiful and brilliant thing. Later on, he learns something of its real nature,
learns that there is in it no "thing" whatever capable of being so held; that it
is but a conditioning of certain rays of light and drops of water, and has
no existence in itself at all.1 That is precisely, the anattaa doctrine. The
rainbow is anattaa. This step in sound philosophy every sane adult is taught to
take. How many take any further steps? For most, "the cares of life and the
deceitfulness of riches" &#8212; riches often of another world as much as of this
&#8212; occupy the mind entirely, and there is no desire for further knowledge.
Yet to some, one day to all, the question cannot but arise &#8212; "If this be
so, if the rainbow be but a conditioning, how about the things of which it
is a conditioning? How about the light and water? Surely those are real
enough?"
<!--l. 49578--><p class="indent" >   Very well, then. The light, first, what is that? Little as we all know, we know
enough to answer that it is an undulation or vibration, a particular kind of very rapid
movement of something. But what is this but just the very answer that was given to
the child about the rainbow, given to the adult about the light? Just as that rainbow
was a conditioning of the light and had no existence in itself, so now the light proves
to be a conditioning in its turn, to have no more existence in itself than the
rainbow had. The light, too is anattaa. Yet, if it be an undulation of what
is it an undulation? Of the ether.2 And what is this ether? Here we are
getting near the limits of our knowledge. Yet this much can be said, that
it is not matter. It is not this, it is not that, it is not the other &#8212; to any
question concerning it, such are the replies: and yet it is not non-existence.
Seek it, and it vanishes from the grasp of the mind, just as the rainbow
and the light did in their turn. It is the very type of insubstantiality, of
anattaa.
<!--l. 49595--><p class="indent" >   The water, however: that at least is tangible and substantive enough. Here is
existence in a way that cannot be denied. Go far enough to north or south, and water
will react to even the Johnsonian fist. Nevertheless, let it but feel the touch of a lump
of sodium, or even of a few inches of hot copper, and where is it? Vanished utterly,
and in its place two things that are no more water than it or light were
rainbow. Water in itself, then, is not and never was &#8212; nothing "was" but a
particular conditioning of these other things, this hydrogen and oxygen, as we
call them; and "water" is but a name for such conditioning. Nor need we

even think that this water-conditioning is the rule, and the water-abolishing
experiments mere curious exceptions. Throughout the whole vast universe that is
visible to us, only in a score of tiny specks is that the case. Not for one
fleeting moment in the great star that daily lights us, or in a single one of the
millions of its peers in the depths of space, could the water-conditioning hold
good.
<!--l. 49612--><p class="indent" >   Both the constituents of the rainbow, therefore, are as truly anattaa as the
rainbow itself. As in the case of the first constituent, however, the question leads us
further. What of these elements, this hydrogen and this oxygen, into which the water
has resolved itself? Well, it is true that, misled by the unsound views of the nature of
things in which they were brought up, many, probably most, chemists did, for a long
time, think that in the ultimate combining particle, the "atom" of such
elements, real, separate, and abiding substance had at last been hunted
down.
<!--l. 49622--><p class="indent" >   Not all, indeed, were so deceived. Hardly had the atomic theory been formulated,
when discerning minds began to seek, first by one means, then by another, for that of
which the atom must be but a compounding. The time had not come, and they were
baffled. How in the last few years they have been completely justified, how abiding
substance eludes us no less in the atom than it does elsewhere, has been already told
elsewhere.
<!--l. 49630--><p class="indent" >   The hydrogen and oxygen, therefore, are in their turn nothing but conditionings
of something else, and when we inquire concerning that of which they are
conditionings, then, as we have done to the ether, we can give to it a name, we can
show that it must behave in such and such a way; but the moment that we attempt
to lay the profane finger of thought upon it, and say that it is this or that, it is
gone.
<!--l. 49638--><p class="indent" >   As of the rainbow, so of all things: process there is, conditioning there is, but
nowhere the least trace of substance, nowhere the least trace of "self."
<!--l. 49642--><p class="indent" >   That is the anattaa doctrine as exemplified by matter.
<!--l. 49644--><p class="indent" >   According to the theory of the soul, familiar to all of us from our childhood, each
living body, at any rate each living human body, is inhabited and informed by a
single psychic entity, the thinker of all its thoughts, doer of its deeds, and director of
the organism generally. In Christianity, until very lately, such a soul was ascribed to
human beings only; animals had no souls. For them death ended all, without
even the hope of a future life in which might be redeemed some of their
unmerited sufferings; and the present writer well remembers his passionate
yearnings as a child after a larger hope for some of the dear animals he
loved so well, and remembers the quenching of this hope by his orthodox
instructors.3
<!--l. 49656--><p class="indent" >   The Roman Catholic Church still holds valorously to this ancient orthodoxy,4
but the rapidly-growing feeling of compassion for animal suffering that has
sprung up in the Western world during the past hundred years, and is one of
its kindliest and noblest features,5 has, outside the Roman pale, begun to
modify opinion, and souls are now postulated for at any rate the higher
animals.
<!--l. 49663--><p class="indent" >   Concurrently with this, an influence of a different kind has accelerated

the movement of men&#8217;s minds in the same direction. This comes from the
acceptance, now general, of the theory of evolution. Fear for the existence of
the human soul was the motive, indeed, of much of the early opposition
to that theory, but now that resistance is no longer possible, it is coming
to be felt that a worthier way out of the difficulty is to be found in the
concession of a soul to these our fellow-beings. The inter-relationship and unity
of all life left, indeed, no other way, if the soul theory was to be held at
all.
<!--l. 49673--><p class="indent" >   The unity of life, however, has other bearings very searching, some of them, upon
the whole question and a consideration of these may throw some light upon animistic
views in general.
<!--l. 49677--><p class="indent" >   For there is no stopping at the higher animals, still less at those who are our
especial friends and lovers. If we concede a soul to a dog, so must we also to a
wolf; if to a cat, then also to a tiger. Nor can we call a halt at any place,
as, passing from these sensitive and splendid beings, we descend lower and
lower through the mammalia till we reach the very humblest of the primitive
marsupials. But the mammalia form but one of the branches of the Tree of
Life; bird, reptile, fish put in the same claim, and it cannot be denied to
them. Not even the lowly Amphioxus brooks the refusal of a soul, and he,
standing at the confines of his kingdom, opens the gates to the still vaster and
dimmer armies of the life we call Invertebrate. To cut an almost endless story
short, we find even here no place at which to stop, and are fain to concede at
last that the microscopic protoplasmic cell-units called the protozoa are as
able to make good their title as the lordliest of the mammalia. Besides, if
we were inclined to pass them by with a De minimis non curat lex, they
could reinforce their claim, by pointing out that man himself enters upon
his existence as a protozoan unit indistinguishable from themselves, and
that if this unit contains a soul, why should not each of them contain one
likewise?
<!--l. 49698--><p class="indent" >   There is another curious consideration. If my soul enters upon existence along
with me, and is mine and no one else&#8217;s, so also does any other being&#8217;s even such as a
protozoan&#8217;s, and it is his soul and no other protozoan&#8217;s. Now, man propagates his
kind at an exceptionally slow rate, but the rate of increase in the lower ranks of life is
prodigious. Statisticians amuse themselves sometimes by computations of
the progeny of a single cod-fish in quite a moderate space of time, and the
results are astonishing. But the multiplication of the protozoa proceeds by
geometrical progression, so that, without books at hand, I am afraid to quote the
shortness of the period in which one such will have given rise to millions. The
influx of new souls into this world alone, therefore, is proceeding at a rate
beyond all power of numbers to convey, and when we reflect that this has been
going on throughout the whole of geological time, the conception is truly
staggering.
<!--l. 49713--><p class="indent" >   Well-found indeed must be the ship of speculation that can carry such a freight as
that across the stormy seas of modern thought!
<!--l. 49716--><p class="indent" >   So far we have considered the single soul in a single body, such as we ourselves
have been taught we are endowed with. But there are cases not so simple. Among the

coelenterata and the polyzoa there are, as well as a single hydroid animals, many
species of compound ones, in which whole colonies of such beings are united by a
"coenosarc" or flesh-body common to them all. What are we to say of the soul in a
case of this sort? Shall we ascribe it to the individuals, to the coenosarc, or to
the colony as a whole? The individual is just such another as any simple
hydroid, yet if we assign to him a soul like that of the simple one, what
becomes of the coenosarc, which is just as much alive? Or, if we assign it to the
community, then why, to the hydra that is rooted in a coenosarc, should
be denied that which is conceded to his cousin who is rooted on a stone?
And, as if this were not perplexing enough, sometimes a member of such a
community will detach himself from it altogether, and conduct his life on his own
account.
<!--l. 49733--><p class="indent" >   To return, however, to the higher beings, ourselves included, with a single body
and its single soul. Closely bound up with the theory of evolution are the facts of
histology, the structures and relationships, that is to say, of the microscopic units
that compose the living being.
<!--l. 49738--><p class="indent" >   Let us consider, first, the corpuscles of the blood. They are of the two kinds, the
large white corpuscles, and the smaller red ones. Both are cells, but we will consider
just now the white ones. They are minute specks of living protoplasm, constantly
changing their shape, moving slowly about, and living upon what they meet
with.
<!--l. 49744--><p class="indent" >   Now, amongst the protozoa, animals consisting of a single cell, whose claims to a
single soul we were obliged to admit capable of being made good with such
irresistible effect, is a creature known as the amoeba. It is a speck of protoplasm that
moves slowly about from point to point, changing its shape as it goes along, and
living upon any suitable object it can meet with. The white blood-corpuscles,
in short, and the amoeba are indistinguishable in composition, aspect and
behavior. They differ in nothing but their habitat: the amoeboid corpuscle (as it
is called) can make every whit as effective a claim to a single soul as the
amoeba.
<!--l. 49755--><p class="indent" >   The one, however, is an independent being; the other an integral part of a most
essential portion of our own economy, essential, indeed, for without them
the blood cannot perform its functions; and is not the blood, as we have
long ago been told, "the life" (Deut. xii,23)? Even if we take refuge in the
brain, and seek to locate the soul where thought goes on, to that retreat also
they pursue us; for stop the blood, and in a few short minutes thinking
ceases.
<!--l. 49763--><p class="indent" >   Clearly there is something wrong. It is evident that the simple-seeming hypothesis
of a single soul in a single body hides a world of perplexities and complications.
The difficulty of the hydrozoan coenosarc has reappeared in a more subtle
form than ever, and that within our own breasts, the very citadel of the
soul-hypothesis.
<!--l. 49769--><p class="indent" >   Nor is this even the end of the matter. The relations of the amoeboid corpuscle to
the amoeba strike the mind at once, and the lessons that they teach are past
mistaking. But the red corpuscle is no whit less a cell, which, were it found elsewhere
than in the blood, would pass without challenge as one among many protozoan

creatures.
<!--l. 49775--><p class="indent" >   Nay, further still. If we watch through the microscope a drop of pond-water full of
paramecium or any other simple animals, it will not be long before we see one of
them constrict into a sort of "waist," develop there a medial cell-wall, and part along
that into two, each of which proceeds without more ado to go about its own
business.6
<!--l. 49781--><p class="indent" >   In paramecium and its congeners the new cells leave each other, but in slightly
higher animals they remain united along the medial wall, dividing, perhaps, and
redividing until we have a tissue or colony of several cells. The members of
such a tissue are to the free separating cells as the hydroids of a coenosarcal
community to the solitary hydroids. The inner nature of the cell remains the
same.
<!--l. 49788--><p class="indent" >   Now, all the tissues of the living body are neither more nor less than
just such colonies. Modified in various ways according to the nature of the
tissue, here for muscle, here for skin, there for bone, differently again for
nerve, and finally in a special way for brain itself: the units of these tissues
are, throughout the body, cells, alike in their essential nature, different only
in their modifications. The blood corpuscles are just some of these cells
which, in order to perform a particular function, remained detached and
free to move, like the protozoa. And every activity of the being, physical
or psychical, depends entirely on the co-ordinated activities, physical or
psychical, of this vast multitude, which indeed no man can number. But
each one of these is, as we now perceive, a being to whom, if we set out the
hypothesis of souls, it is logically impossible to refuse a separate soul-unit of its
own.
<!--l. 49803--><p class="indent" >   Seeking in the first part of this article for the essential, inner self or being of the
rainbow, light, water, and their elements, we found that there was not in any one of
them any essential self or being whatsoever. Every one of them turned out to be, by
its very nature, a conditioning of elements that were not itself, and this held good to
the last stages of analysis that knowledge could apply. Every one of them had to be
pronounced anattaa.
<!--l. 49811--><p class="indent" >   What have we now found (using a biological analysis) to be the case of the living
being? We have found it to be, more conspicuously if possible than even those other
phenomena, a conditioning of a vast number of elements that are not one of them
itself, dependent absolutely upon these elements, having apart from them and their
activities no existence "in itself" whatever.
<!--l. 49818--><p class="indent" >   Beginning with a phenomenon, the rainbow, with regard to which the Anattaa
doctrine is already held by every sane adult, we have followed that doctrine and
found it to apply to the highest form of existence that we know upon this earth.
From the biological point of view, the living being is, and that in a superlative
degree, anattaa.
<!--l. 49824--><p class="indent" >   Further treatment of the anattaa subject is, of course, psychological. With that,
this article is not concerned. But any sound psychology must be in harmony, not at
variance, with biology and physics. Suffice it, then, to say here, that we may be sure
that what is biologically compound will not prove to be psychologically
simple.

<!--l. 49830--><p class="indent" >   Were we ever inclined to regard the doctrines of anattaa and the khandhas as
either fantastic or perverse, we may wonder rather at the discernment which
perceived the one, long before biology and physics were, and at the moderation which
gave us but five khandhas where modern science would give for one of them
alone (viz. ruupa) something much more like five hundred millions! Far more
marvellous, however, was that surpassing spiritual penetration that could see,
in this compositeness of our nature, nothing less than the balm of sorrow,
the justification of the Golden Rule, and life&#8217;s liberation from the house of
bondage.
<!--l. 49840--><p class="indent" >   Parts of this article may have, perhaps, a somewhat polemical expression. Well,
argument, if undertaken at all, should be made conclusive and convincing, if that
be possible, and should result in intellectual conviction. But intellectual
conviction is not religion, it may not even have religion as its consequence
in life. Something more is needed. He who discerns not life&#8217;s pathos and
its sorrow, will not find out the Annattaa path of love to sorrow&#8217;s utter
ceasing.

<!--l. 49853--><p class="indent" >   1.The writer can even now recall his own childish perplexity at being told that a
rainbow was "the sun shining upon drops of water." For what resemblance of
any kind did it bear to either drops of water or the sun?2.The theory of
a "luminiferous ether" as the medium in which light &#8212; and all forms of
electromagnetic radiation &#8212; propagates was dealt a mortal blow in the 1887
Michelson-Morley experiment. The final nails were hammered in its coffin by Einstein
in 1905. The author, writing in 1911, was probably not aware of this. &#8212;
ATI ed.3.The great Bishop Butler, however, ventured to suggest some such
hope.4.With the sinister corollary that as animals have no souls, neither have
they any rights.5.In the Buddhist countries of Asia such a sentiment has
long prevailed.6.In passing, it may well be asked, what has happened with
the soul. Has that divided also, or has a new soul arisen to animate one
of the two bodies? And if so, which, for they are substantially equal and
alike?
<!--l. 49870--><p class="indent" >   The Spell of Narcissism and the Anattaa Doctrine
<!--l. 49872--><p class="indent" >   by M.W. Padmasiri de Silva
<!--l. 49874--><p class="indent" >   "Narcissism is a passion the intensity of which in many individuals can only be
compared with sexual desire and the desire to stay alive. In fact, many times it
proves to be stronger than either. Even in the average individual in whom it does not
reach such intensity, there remains a narcissistic core which appears to be almost
indestructible."
<!--l. 49880--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Erich Fromm, The Heart of Man
<!--l. 49882--><p class="indent" >   The word "narcissism" is derived from a Greek legend. Narcissus in mythology is
a beautiful youth who loved no one till he saw his own body reflected in water.
Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection; finally he pined away, died,
and was turned into the flower of like name.1 Thus the word "narcissism"
derived from this legend has been generally used to refer to a kind of morbid
self-love.2

<!--l. 49890--><p class="indent" >   The concept of narcissism was woven into psychological theory by Sigmund Freud.
Freud himself borrowed this name from Paul Nacke, who used the term to describe a
perversion, where "an adult individual lavishes upon his own body all the caresses
expended only upon a sexual object other than himself."3 it was Freud, however, who
grasped for the first time the tremendous significance of the concept of narcissism.
Freud&#8217;s essay on narcissism is one of the richest spots in his psychology,
unfortunately neglected by his fellow psychiatrists and submerged by the
popular image of Freud&#8217;s work. Freud&#8217;s essay on narcissism is a little gem
which would have been pushed into an insignificant corner in the field of
psychological theory, but for the efforts of Eric Fromm who remarks that, "One
of the most fruitful and far-reaching of Freud&#8217;s discoveries is his concept
of narcissism. Freud himself considered it to be one of his most important
findings..."4
<!--l. 49906--><p class="indent" >   In this paper I shall very briefly refer to the Freudian concept of narcissism and
then present Fromm&#8217;s development on this against the background of the anattaa
doctrine.
<!--l. 49910--><p class="indent" >   Before his paper on narcissism appeared, Freud made a clear distinction between
the sexual instinct (libido) and the ego instinct, or in more popular terms between
"love" and "hunger." But he came across an interesting category of patients whose
condition presented a great challenge to this distinction between sexual and
ego instincts. "We became slowly accustomed to the conception that the
libido, which we find attached to certain objects and which is the desire
to gain some satisfaction in these objects, can also abandon these objects
and set the ego itself in their place," says Freud.5 More reflection on this
point made him realize that a fixation of this kind to the subject&#8217;s own
body and his person was not something accidental, it is probable that this
is the original condition of man (primary narcissism) out of which object
love develops later without thereby necessarily affecting a disappearance of
narcissism.
<!--l. 49925--><p class="indent" >   This conception of narcissism was backed by evidence from a number of sources.
In megalomania, we get the subjective over-estimation of self-importance, in
dementia praecox we get the magical belief in the "omnipotence of thought." Freud
also studied the mind of the infant and the primitive man and here too
discovered an expression of narcissism. There are also other situations in life
like disease, after an accident, in old age etc., "when the tendency to this
withdrawal into self-preoccupation is apt to become pronounced." Normal
love is also affected by a great deal of narcissism. The notion of narcissism
was used to explain a wide range of distinct phenomena ranging from love,
jealousy, and fear to mass phenomena. Continuing on these lines Fromm has
worked out the spell of narcissism in group behavior, nationalism, and war. It
was due to Fromm&#8217;s insight that the concept of narcissism was salvaged
from its limited base in the libido theory and given a more comprehensive
interpretation.
<!--l. 49942--><p class="indent" >   Narcissism in Buddhism and the Writings of Fromm
<!--l. 49944--><p class="indent" >   Fromm himself makes a reference to Buddhism which is extremely significant for
an understanding of narcissism. Fromm says that the essential teachings of all the

humanistic religions in the world can be summarized in one sentence: "It is the goal
of man to overcome one&#8217;s narcissism. Perhaps this principle is nowhere expressed
more radically than in Buddhism."6 Fromm concludes on these lines that if
man sheds the "illusion of his indestructible ego" and the other objects of
greed, only then can he be totally open, awake and be fully related to the
world.
<!--l. 49954--><p class="indent" >   The illusion of the indestructible ego that Fromm mentions is quite clearly a
reference to the Buddhist doctrine of anattaa (egolessness). There is no ego entity
existing apart and independently of those physical and mental processes that
constitute life.
<!--l. 49959--><p class="indent" >   The illusion of the ego has two basic forms: eternity belief and annihilation belief.
The craving for selfish pursuits arises with a false conception of personality, based on
the dogma of personal immortality (sassata-di.t.thi), and the craving for annihilation
arises with a false conception of personality, based on the annihilationist view
(uccheda di.t.thi).7
<!--l. 49965--><p class="indent" >   An understanding of the doctrine of sakkaaya-di.t.thi (twenty forms of wrong
personality beliefs) helps us to grasp the Buddhist doctrine of egolessness. Where
there is a mere complex of corporeality, feeling, perception, dispositions, and
consciousness, the individual being subject to the ego illusion assumes the existence
of an ego:
<!--l. 49971--><p class="indent" >   1-5: Ego is identified with corporeality, feeling, perception, dispositions, and
consciousness.6-10: Ego is contained in them.11-15: Ego is independent of
them.16-20: Ego is their owner.
<!--l. 49975--><p class="indent" >   This does not mean that the ego is merely an intellectual construction. The roots
of the ego illusion are strong and it is fed by deep effective processes.8 These
processes are dormant proclivities described in the Discourses of the Buddha as the
latent desire for continued existence (bhava-raaga anusaya).
<!--l. 49981--><p class="indent" >   Corporeal Overtones of the Ego Concept
<!--l. 49983--><p class="indent" >   The origin of the Freudian concept of narcissism is the point at which Narcissus
falls in love with his own body. In relating auto-eroticism to narcissism, Freud says
that the ego is first and foremost a "body-ego." Fromm also says that one of the most
elementary examples of narcissism can be found in the attitude to the body exhibited
by the average person.9
<!--l. 49990--><p class="indent" >   The narcissistic relation to one&#8217;s body has its parallel in the doctrine of the
Buddha, where he discusses the operation of personality beliefs (atta di.t.thi) in
relation to corporeality. The majority of the people who are not skilled in the
doctrine of the Buddha are subject to the ego-illusion associated with their
body. This ego-illusion is described in the suttas: These people who are
untrained in the doctrine of the Buddha, "regard body as the self (attaaa, Skr:
aatman); they regard the self as having a body, body as being in the self, the
self as being in the body. &#8217;I am the body,&#8217; say they; &#8217;body is mine&#8217;; and
they are possessed by this idea." The Buddha also says that due to the
excessive attachment to the body, when it alters and changes, sorrow and
grief set in; thus the doctrine of anattaa is linked to the doctrine of dukkha
(suffering).
<!--l. 50004--><p class="indent" >   However, while the body-image concept of the ego dominates the thought of

Freud, the Buddha offers a more comprehensive analysis, relating the ego-illusion to
feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness. To use a phrase of Wolheim, "the
corporeal overtones of the ego concept" prevented Freud from presenting a broad
base for his theory of narcissism. In fact, Wolheim has pointed out a significant
ambiguity in the Freudian analysis of narcissism. Sometimes Freud conceives
narcissism as an attraction towards one&#8217;s own person, and sometimes as an attraction
towards one&#8217;s own body.
<!--l. 50014--><p class="indent" >   Fromm has not merely re-vitalized the Freudian concept of narcissism, but takes
it very much beyond this, and brings it close to the doctrine of the Buddha. Not
merely does Fromm offer a theory of narcissism which is of interest to the
Buddhist, but he quite clearly refers to the doctrine of the Buddha: "The
&#8217;awakened&#8217; person of whom Buddhist teaching speaks is the person who
has overcome his narcissism, and who is therefore capable of being fully
awake."10
<!--l. 50022--><p class="indent" >   The Narcissistic "Self-Image"
<!--l. 50024--><p class="indent" >   The narcissistic person is not only proud of his body but he has an exaggerated
and inflated image of all aspects of his personality: his intelligence, his honor and his
wealth, his social standing, etc. "Just as the narcissistic person has made his
&#8217;self-image&#8217; the object of his narcissistic attachment, he does the same with
everything connected with him. His ideas, his knowledge, his house, but also people
in his &#8217;sphere of interest&#8217; become objects of his narcissistic attachment."11 As both
Freud and Fromm point out, one&#8217;s narcissistic image about oneself is projected on to
the children. This is extended to identification with wider groups, culminating in
nationalism.
<!--l. 50036--><p class="indent" >   Karen Horney was quick to point out that at the root of this kind of narcissistic
self-image is found a kind of "self-inflation" rather than "self-love," with a need not
for love but the admiration of others.
<!--l. 50041--><p class="indent" >   At this point we see the relevance of the Buddhist concept of maana (self-conceit).
Self-conceit, according to the Buddha, takes three forms: I am superior to others
(seyyo&#8217; ham asmi-maana); I am equal to others (sadiso &#8217;ham asmi-maana); I am
inferior to others (hino &#8217;ham asmi maana). Maana is one of the fetters that bind man
to the ills of existence, and it varies from a crude feeling of pride to a subtle
feeling of distinctiveness that prevails till the attainment of arahantship
(sainthood).
<!--l. 50050--><p class="indent" >   If a person is proud of his attainments, exaggerates them, and feels infuriated
when someone gives a lower estimation of his doings, he suffers from an
inflated sense of vanity (maana mada). If he feels frustrated, disappointed and
underestimates his attainments he is subject to a kind of inferiority complex.
This is similar to what Fromm describes as "depression." "The element
of mourning in melancholia refers, in my opinion to the narcissistic image
of the wonderful &#8217;I&#8217; which has died, and for which the depressed person is
mourning."
<!--l. 50060--><p class="indent" >   Pride, vanity and conceit manifest clearly in interpersonal relations, as a
reactive expression, as "wounded narcissism." Its mechanism is similar to what
Freud refers to as "secondary narcissism." One&#8217;s wounded narcissism gives
way either to an ego collapse, depression and melancholy or to anger and

fury.
<!--l. 50066--><p class="indent" >   The Antinomy between Self-love and Love for Others
<!--l. 50068--><p class="indent" >   Apart from discussing the pathology of narcissism and its crippling impact on
healthy personality growth, Fromm raises the question whether there could be a kind
of healthy self-love, a benign form of narcissism as different from malignant
narcissism. Is a certain degree of narcissism necessary for survival? Is there a
necessary antinomy between love of self and others?
<!--l. 50075--><p class="indent" >   Part of the problem could of course arise due to the linguistic issues besetting the
use of the word "self" in diverse contexts. A grasp of the subtle mechanisms that bear
upon the psychology of human motivation can clear up another facet of this issue.
Ultimately this might involve a whole philosophical perspective or a way of looking at
the universe and man.
<!--l. 50082--><p class="indent" >   Fromm&#8217;s analysis of this question too can be presented against the background of
the Buddhist analysis of the issues involved. The problem arises when we consider
love for others and love for oneself as alternatives which are mutually exclusive.12
Selfishness is not identical with mature self-love. In fact selfishness is caused by a real
lack of genuine self-love. "Love, in principle, is indivisible as far as the connection
between the &#8217;objects&#8217; and one&#8217;s own self is concerned. Genuine love is an expression
of productiveness and implies care, respect, responsibility, and knowledge. It is not an
&#8217;affect&#8217; in the sense of being affected by somebody, but an active striving for the
growth and happiness of the loved person, rooted in one&#8217;s own capacity to
love."13
<!--l. 50095--><p class="indent" >   Fromm says that it is only a "symbiotic attachment" which is rooted in one&#8217;s
narcissism. Symbiotic attachment takes two basic forms: that of passive submission
(to use a clinical term, masochism), and active dominance (sadism). The masochistic
person escapes from the unbearable feeling of separation and isolation by
making himself a part and parcel of another person; the sadistic person wants
to escape from his aloneness by making another person part and parcel of
himself.
<!--l. 50104--><p class="indent" >   From the Buddhist standpoint, a clear distinction could be made between
self-devoting motives and self-centered motives. The practice of metta-bhaavanaa is
the finest expression of the fusing of self-love and love for others in Buddhism. The
meditation of loving-kindness is first developed towards oneself and then radiates
towards others. One first starts with the thought, "May I be happy," and then
extends it to the welfare and happiness of others.
<!--l. 50112--><p class="indent" >   Even, where a person makes a sacrifice and forgoes certain material benefits for
the sake of others, it merely strengthens his self-development. The very nature of the
good is such that no one can seek the salvation of others without seeking his own. It
is extremely important to mention that Buddhism considers the life of renunciation
as the highest expression of the other-regarding instincts. This is very well expressed
in the Kindred Sayings:
<!--l. 50120--><p class="indent" >   He who of both is a physician, since Himself he healeth and the others
too.
<!--l. 50123--><p class="indent" >   In the suttas, there is a classification of beings into four types: He who is neither
bent on his own profit nor on the profit of another; he who is bent on the profit of
another but not his own; he who is bent on his own profits not another&#8217;s; and he who

is bent on the profit both of himself and another.14 The Buddha considers the last
category as the best.
<!--l. 50130--><p class="indent" >   The context in which the Buddha made the analysis cited above may be a little
different from the context in which Fromm has made a case for genuine
self-love. But I do not see any fundamental difference between the approaches in
Buddhism and that of Erich Fromm. It is true that the Buddha was basically
concerned with the life of renunciation, and the other-regarding virtues in
Buddhism are based on a deeper doctrine of compassion. But if we present the
basic human relations presented in a homily to Sigaala, it will be quite clear
that even in limited social situations, the Buddha advocates mature human
relations which deny any symbiotic attachment15 of abnormal domination or
dependence.
<!--l. 50141--><p class="indent" >   There is however a wider dimension in which the Buddhist analysis of
self-love has to be presented. A layman who has made a necessary compromise
with life will find it difficult to handle the obtruding ego, while the recluse
committed to the path of renunciation will have at his command a more
effective therapeutic control over the spell of narcissism. The only way to
bridge the gap is to discover significant similarities between the techniques
used by the psychiatrist in special "clinical situations" and that the recluse
who has made a life-long commitment to a therapeutic procedure of his
own.

<!--l. 50602--><p class="indent" >   [Extracts from Anattaa-Dipani. Adapted from the translation by U Sein Nyo Tun.
From The Light of Dhamma (Rangoon), viii, 2.]
<!--l. 50605--><p class="indent" >   I shall show here the advantages arising from the realization of the characteristic
of not-self (anattaa).
<!--l. 50608--><p class="indent" >   If one can clearly perceive the characteristic of anattaa, one achieves the
knowledge pertaining to the path of stream-entry (sotaapatti-magga-~naa.na),
wherein ego-delusion (atta-di.t.thi) and personality belief (sakkaaya-di.t.thi) are
totally eradicated.
<!--l. 50613--><p class="indent" >   Anattaa Realization and Past Kamma
<!--l. 50615--><p class="indent" >   All beings who drift and circle in the long and beginningless round of rebirths
called sa"msaara rarely encounter the teachings of a Buddha. They may not
encounter them for the time of even a hundred thousand world-cycles. They may not
get the opportunity of hearing of a Buddha&#8217;s teachings even once while an infinite
number of world-cycles elapse. The number of existences and world-cycles
in which beings have been afflicted by evil and error predominate. Hence,
in the mental make-up of a being, there is always an infinite number of
unwholesome actions (akusala-kamma) that can result in its falling into a
world of utmost torment (avici-niraya), or in being reborn in other worlds of
woe.
<!--l. 50627--><p class="indent" >   Ego-delusion is the foremost of the unwholesome kamma of old and accompanies
beings incessantly. As long as personality-belief exists, these old unwholesome actions
are fiery and full of strength. Though beings may be enjoying happiness and
splendour as deities, as divine rulers (Sakka) or in the fine-material or immaterial
Brahma worlds, yet they necessarily exist, as it were, with their heads forever turned
towards the four worlds of woe (apaaya).
<!--l. 50635--><p class="indent" >   Palm fruits in a palm grove have an ever-existing tendency to fall to the ground,
even though they may be attached to the very top of a palm tree. So long as the
stalks are firm the fruits will remain on the tree; but as soon as the stalks weaken
they will inevitably fall to the ground. In the same way, deities and Brahma gods
afflicted with ego-delusion will be able to exist in their respective worlds only as long
as the "stalks" of vital life force as deities and Brahmas remain intact. But when
these "stalks" of vital life force are severed, they inevitably fall into worlds
below, just like the palm fruits. This happens because personality-belief,
which is ever present in the mental make-up of a being, is a great burden &#8212;
heavier than even the Mount Meru &#8212; inasmuch as personality-belief gathers
in its fold an infinite number of unwholesome kamma accumulated in the
past.
<!--l. 50650--><p class="indent" >   Thus beings who harbor within themselves this personality-belief are continually
under pressure to gradually descend or directly to fall towards the worlds of woe
although they may be living in the highest of the Brahma worlds. The cases
of beings living in the lower Brahma worlds or in the celestial or human
world, are much worse and need no further comment. Although such beings
may exist as the rulers of Brahma worlds or of celestial worlds, yet their
mental makeup contains, ready-made, the eight great hells, the lesser hells,
the worlds of ghosts and demons and the animal realm. It is because these
beings do not know that the tendency towards those misery-filled lower

realms is always present in their mental make-up, that the Brahma kings and
divine kings can afford to derive pleasure and enjoyment from their form of
existence.
<!--l. 50664--><p class="indent" >   But all the old unwholesome actions that have accompanied beings throughout
the long and beginningless round of rebirths, will be extinguished completely when
their head and chief, personality-belief (sakkaaya-di.t.thi), has been made to
disappear entirely.
<!--l. 50669--><p class="indent" >   Apart from that old unwholesome kamma that had accompanied beings since
time immemorial, even in the case of the numerous unwholesome actions committed
in the present existence (such as killing or stealing), their (rebirth-producing)
tendencies entirely disappear as soon as their head and chief, the personality-belief,
becomes completely extinguished. For such beings there may remain occasion to fear
affliction by vermin, but there no longer remains any occasion for them to fear the
resultants of the infinite number of past unwholesome actions.1
<!--l. 50678--><p class="indent" >   Beings whose mental make-up is entirely freed from personality-belief have, as it
were, their heads turned towards the higher planes of the celestial and Brahma
worlds even though they may be living in the human world. And if living in the lower
celestial and Brahma realms, their heads are always turned towards the
higher planes of those worlds. They resemble the vapors that invariably
rise upwards from forests and mountains during the latter part of the rainy
season.
<!--l. 50686--><p class="indent" >   This shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of
personality-belief as far as relating to past kamma.
<!--l. 50689--><p class="indent" >   Anattaa Realization and Future Kamma
<!--l. 50691--><p class="indent" >   Human beings, deities and Brahmas, who have personality-belief in their mental
make-up, may be good and virtuous beings today, but any time later they may
commit an unlimited number of evil deeds, even grave offences like matricide,
parricide, killing of arahants, etc.; and this may happen to them tomorrow or the day
after, next month or next year, or in following existences. Today they may be
devotees within the fold of the Buddha&#8217;s Dispensation, while tomorrow or the day
after, etc., they may be outside its pale or even become enemies and destroyers of the
Buddha Saasana.
<!--l. 50701--><p class="indent" >   Those beings however, human or divine, who well perceive the characteristic of
not-self (anattaa) and thus have entirely extirpated personality-belief from their
mental make-up, will cease to commit evil deeds and other unwholesome kamma even
in their dreams, although they may continue to circle in sa"msaara for many more
lives to come. From the day of freeing themselves from personality-belief until their
final existence before their attainment of Nibbaana, they will always remain within
the fold of the Buddha&#8217;s Dispensation, wherever they are reborn. They will never
appear in a form of existence or in a world where the Buddha&#8217;s Dispensation is
absent.
<!--l. 50712--><p class="indent" >   This shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of
personality-belief as far as relating to future kamma.
<!--l. 50715--><p class="indent" >   How Past Kamma Becomes Inoperative
<!--l. 50717--><p class="indent" >   How the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past become
inoperative2 at the moment when personality-belief is extinguished, may be

illustrated as follows:
<!--l. 50721--><p class="indent" >   In a string of beads where a great number of beads are strung together by a
strong silk thread, if one bead is pulled all the others will follow the one that is
pulled. But if the silk thread is cut or removed, pulling one of the beads will not
disturb the other beads because there is no longer any attachment between
them.
<!--l. 50727--><p class="indent" >   Similarly, a being that possesses personality-belief harbors a strong attachment to
the series of the aggregates (khandha) arisen during past existences and past world
cycles, and transforms them into an ego. Thinking, "In the past I have often
been a human being, a deity, or a Brahmaa," he acquires the thread that is
personality-belief. It is thus that the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the
past which have not yet produced resultants, will accompany that being wherever he
may be reborn. These unwholesome actions of the past resemble beads that are
strung and bound together by a strong thread.
<!--l. 50738--><p class="indent" >   Beings, however, who clearly perceive the characteristic of not-self and have rid
themselves of personality-belief, will perceive that the bodily and mental aggregates
that arise and disappear even within the short period of one sitting, do so as
separate phenomena and not as a closely interlinked continuum. The concept
of "my self" which is like the thread, is no longer present. Those bodily
and mental processes appear to them like the beads from which the thread
has been removed. They clearly perceive that the unwholesome actions of
the past committed by them, are not "persons" nor "beings" not an "I"
nor "my actions," but that they arise and disappear in an instant. That is
why that past unwholesome kamma disappears as soon as personality-belief
disappears.
<!--l. 50752--><p class="indent" >   It should be known, however, that only unwholesome (akusala) kamma
disappears. Wholesome (kusala) kamma of the past does not disappear through the
mere disappearance of personality-belief. It is only when the stage of the path of
sainthood (arahatta-magga) is reached and when craving (ta.nhaa) is completely
eradicated that wholesome kamma of the past becomes inoperative.
<!--l. 50759--><p class="indent" >   The Evil of Personality Belief
<!--l. 50761--><p class="indent" >   Personality-belief is an evil that is extremely deep-rooted and far-reaching.
<!--l. 50763--><p class="indent" >   A person who commits an evil deed and thus becomes extremely agitated and
worried over the prospect of being reborn in states of woe, transforms that evil deed
of his into a "self" (attaa) and becomes greatly distressed by such firmly held
thoughts as, "I have done wrong. I have gravely erred." But if that being fully
comprehends and realizes the characteristic of not-self and thereby can abolish
attachment to such thoughts as, "I have gravely erred," that kamma (unless it is a
weighty one) will no longer have the power of producing resultants (in a future
rebirth) so far as that being is concerned. But, generally, beings do not discard their
attachment to such thoughts.
<!--l. 50775--><p class="indent" >   Although that kamma does not, as it were, desire to accompany that being nor to
produce resultants, yet it is forced to do so by the fact that being takes possession of
it by harboring such thoughts as, "I myself have committed that deed. It is my
kamma." Because of this forcible possessive act that kamma is obliged to produce its
resultants. To this extent are beings possessing personality-belief deluded and erring

in their ways.
<!--l. 50783--><p class="indent" >   It is the same in the case of unwholesome kamma of the past that remains
operative. It is because of the forcible possessive act of personality-belief that this
kamma accompanies beings throughout their samsaric wanderings and will produce
its resultants in due course.
<!--l. 50788--><p class="indent" >   Beings find that they cannot discard their unwholesome actions though being
oppressed by their resultants, and suffering great privations in the process. They
think, "I have committed those evil deeds," and thus (identifying themselves with
them) they take, as it were, possession of them. Thus these unwholesome actions
cannot help to produce resultants and continue to do so, disabling those beings
to achieve release. To this extent, personality-belief is profoundly evil and
erroneous.
<!--l. 50797--><p class="indent" >   Beings are very much afraid of the dangers of disease, old age, and death. But,
through harboring such fear, they become attached to the past incidents of disease,
old age, and death by identifying themselves with those experiences in the thought,
"For a long time in the past I have suffered these ills." Thus they find it impossible to
relinquish even such fearsome phenomena. Hence these phenomena of disease, old
age, and death continue to accompany them, as it were, against their own will, and
continue to cause oppression. To this extent, too, is personality-belief profoundly evil
and erroneous.
<!--l. 50807--><p class="indent" >   In this present existence, too, when external and internal dangers are encountered
or disease and ailments occur, beings attach themselves to them through such
thoughts as, "I feel pain; I feel hurt," and thus take a possessive attitude towards
them. This becomes an act of bondage that later may obstruct beings from
ridding themselves of those diseases, ailments, and dangers. Because this
bondage through personality-belief is so strong, beings have often found those
diseases, ailments, or dangers to be their inseparable companions through
many existences up to the present day. Thus, personality creates a possessive
attachment even to diseases, ailments, and dangers though these are so greatly
oppressive.
<!--l. 50819--><p class="indent" >   Also fears of encountering disease, ailments, and dangers in future, will produce
such a bondage. And as long as there is personality-belief, beings will certainly meet
such eventualities also in future.
<!--l. 50823--><p class="indent" >   This is a brief description of how personality-belief is profoundly evil and
erroneous.
<!--l. 50826--><p class="indent" >   Superficial and Deep Attachment
<!--l. 50828--><p class="indent" >   The attachments of craving (ta.nhaa) and conceit (maana) are not necessarily
attachments of wrong views (di.t.thi). Craving develops an attachment for all the
(physical and mental) phenomena in the three spheres of existence, in the form, "It is
my property." Conceit develops a proud attachment for them in the form, "It
is I who owns it" or "It is I who has those great qualities." In the case of
beings who have personality-belief, craving and conceit follow the lead given
by personality-belief. In the case of stream-winners, once-returners, and
non-returners who have eliminated personality-belief, craving and conceit follow the
distortion of perception (sa~n~naa-vipallaasa) and the distortion of consciousness
(citta-vipallaasa). The attachments produced by these distortions are superficial; but

those produced by personality-belief are deep.
<!--l. 50843--><p class="indent" >   This ends the description how unwholesome actions of the past totally cease with
the disappearance of personality-belief.
<!--l. 50846--><p class="indent" >   Notes
<!--l. 50848--><p class="indent" >   1.This means that the unwholesome actions of the past can no longer generate a
new rebirth, though they might cause resultants (vipaaka) to appear in the present
life times of stream-winners and even of arahants. &#8212; (Editor, The Wheel)]2.I.e.,

<!--l. 50897--><p class="indent" >   Chas. F. Knight
<!--l. 50899--><p class="indent" >   In the Sa"muytta-Nikaaya is the story of Vacchagotta the Wanderer, the man
who was concerned with the existence or non-existence of his "self."
<!--l. 50903--><p class="indent" >   In the Digha-Nikaaya is the story of Po.t.thapaada, an inveterate asker of
questions, in search of a "soul."
<!--l. 50906--><p class="indent" >   It is of interest to note the different response these two inquirers received from the
Buddha. Vacchagotta&#8217;s questions remained unanswered, while Po.t.thapaada&#8217;s
doctrinal questions were discussed and answered in full.
<!--l. 50911--><p class="indent" >   Both of these inquirers have their counterparts in the West today &#8212;
those who are concerned with a "self," and those who are concerned with a

"soul." While the two terms self and soul are often used as synonyms and
interchangeable, I think that those who use them in reference to themselves have a
differential conception of the two words. The seeker for a "self" is more concerned
with the preservation of his ego in the here and now, whereas the would-be
possessor of a "soul" is perturbed as to survival after death. It is empiric
that the protagonists of the self theory, or concept, are by nature extrovert
and egotistic. On the other hand, those who most ardently cling to the soul
concept, are less concerned with asserting themselves before others, but are
concerned mainly with their inmost nature &#8212; natural introverts. Yet these too in
their quiet way are also egotistical, in that they desire to preserve their
"identity."
<!--l. 50927--><p class="indent" >   While the Asian Buddhist world unanimously accepts and adheres to the doctrine
of anatta &#8212; the absence of an abiding and stable entity &#8212; it is by no means
uncommon to find nominal "Buddhists" in the West who are unable to shake off 2000
years of indoctrination of the "soul" concept, and, as a consequence, bring to their
"Buddhism" preconceived views, often bolstered up by a syncretic admixture of other
Indian beliefs.
<!--l. 50936--><p class="indent" >   The story of Vacchagotta precedes this article. His questions are akin to asking a
man if he has stopped beating his wife. The man may have not have lifted his hand
against her at any time, but if he answers "Yes," the inference is that he had
previously beaten her. If he answers "No," the inference is that he still beats
her. Had the Buddha agreed that Vacchagotta had a self, for the Buddha
did not deny the existence of phenomenon, Vacchagotta could have taken
it as a confirmation of the brahmin belief in an eternal atman, or spark
of the Divine to survive after death. Had the Buddha agreed that there
was not a "self" in the ultimate sense, Vacchagotta could have taken the
reply as an endorsement of the view held by the annihilationists &#8212; that
nothing survived after death. Vacchagotta was not asking questions idly,
but this was an occasion on which confusion could have arisen, and so the
Buddha maintained the noble silence and left Vacchagotta to ponder further
on the point that was bothering him. He still had not grasped the higher
truths of karma and aniccaa under which the conventional "self" is but a
momentary manifestation of ever-changing components to be cast aside at
death, and without a stable entity to be carried forward to a new birth.
Later, Vacchagotta did grasp these truths, and he finally became one of the
arahants.
<!--l. 50959--><p class="indent" >   Those who are fond of quoting this dialogue between the Buddha and
Vacchagotta to support their theory of a soul seldom, if ever, go on to the Buddha&#8217;s
final explanation to Aananda which closes the passage, and which, incidentally
displays one of those flashes of the Buddha&#8217;s humor that peeps out here and
there in his dealings with inquirers. It would be stretching the argument
beyond reason to presume that the Buddha was not capable or not inclined
to make an assertion on the "soul" if it really existed, in the light of his
many expositions of its non-existence. The commentator, Kumaralabdha,
quoted by Dr. Malalasekera in the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, puts it in a
nutshell:

<!--l. 50971--><p class="indent" >   If there was an "atta" (soul), what on earth was there to prevent the Buddha
from saying so?
<!--l. 50974--><p class="indent" >   For our purpose we can dismiss the "self" seekers, for while they insist on having
a "self" to satisfy their ego, many of them give at least lip-service to the
anattaa doctrine. They have their "self" that thinks, writes, or teaches, to
present to the world. They have their "self" that strives to lift the "self" still
higher in man&#8217;s estimation, till it equals or becomes part of the "SELF,"
and some go on to the "Overself," or Godhead by another name. These
people see themselves as gods in the making, and their word is final &#8212; so far
as they are concerned. Their concepts are usually derived via Theosophy
from pre-Buddhistic Brahmanism, even though they may call themselves
"Buddhists." Brahman, the First Cause, or Great SELF, was personified as Brahma
the Creator, the Self, and all beings were, or had in them, a spark of the
Divine, a lesser self, which was still essentially of the same substance as the
Great SELF, to which it eventually returned when purified by rites and
ceremonies.
<!--l. 50993--><p class="indent" >   On the question of a "soul," Po.t.thapaada and his friends were discussing the
importance of consciousness, its arising and its ceasing. One had put forward the
theory that:
<!--l. 50997--><p class="indent" >   "States of consciousness come to a man without reason and without a cause, and
so also do they pass away. At the time when they spring up in him, then he becomes
conscious."
<!--l. 51001--><p class="indent" >   This was rejected by a second speaker who protested:
<!--l. 51003--><p class="indent" >   "That, sirs, will never be as you say. Consciousness, sirs, is a man&#8217;s soul (attaa).
It is the soul that comes and goes. When the soul comes into a man, then
he becomes conscious; when the soul goes away out of a man, he becomes
unconscious."
<!--l. 51008--><p class="indent" >   Seeing the Buddha approaching they decided to ask his opinion on the matter,
and Po.t.thapaada outlines the pith of their discussion and the various arguments
that have been put forward.
<!--l. 51012--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha refuted the former view by stating that it was precisely through a
reason, by means of a cause, that states of consciousness come and go. "By training
some states of consciousness arise. By training others pass away." Through
training one sort of consciousness arises, and through training another passes
away.
<!--l. 51019--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha illustrates his meaning by a lengthy discourse on training,
showing the causal origination of consciousness as a consequence. He then goes
on to the cessation of consciousness dependent on the cessation of ideas as
the adept in meditative practices achieves the various trance states of the
jhaanas.
<!--l. 51025--><p class="indent" >   "To him neither thinking anymore, nor fancying the ideas, the states of
consciousness he had pass away, and no others, coarser than they, arise. So he enters
in jhaana. Thus it is, Po.t.thapaada, that the attainment of the cessation of conscious
ideas takes place step by step."
<!--l. 51031--><p class="indent" >   The first proposition of the independent arising of ideas leading to consciousness
having thus been disposed of by the Buddha, Po.t.thapaada admits to not

having heard this explained before, "but I now understand what you say." He
then proceeds to the second opinion that had been expressed by his fellow
mendicants:
<!--l. 51037--><p class="indent" >   "Is then, Sir, the consciousness identical with a man&#8217;s soul, or is consciousness one
thing and the soul another?"
<!--l. 51040--><p class="indent" >   "But what then, Po.t.thapaada? Do you really fall back on the soul?" queries the
Buddha.
<!--l. 51043--><p class="indent" >   Po.t.thapaada replies that he takes for granted the existence of a soul of some
kind. Maybe a material soul, he suggests tentatively, but without much conviction.
Failing that, what about a soul the exact copy of the body, but so subtle in texture
that it could only be described as being "made of mind." No? Well then a soul
without form, and made of consciousness.
<!--l. 51050--><p class="indent" >   To all of these suggestions the Buddha has but one reply. Suppose you did have a
soul conforming to any of these descriptions, still some ideas, some states
of consciousness, would arise to the man, and others would pass away, so
"you can see how consciousness must be one thing, and the soul would be
another."
<!--l. 51056--><p class="indent" >   However Po.t.thapaada was still not convinced that he was totally lacking in a
soul. On that point he had a closed mind as is shown by his next question. He does
not ask: "Is there, or is there not, a soul?," but is it possible for him to ever
understand what the soul is.
<!--l. 51062--><p class="indent" >   "Is it possible for me to understand whether consciousness is the man&#8217;s soul, or is
the one different from the other?"
<!--l. 51065--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha&#8217;s reply to Po.t.thapaada is equally applicable to the "soul-seekers" of
today; those who accept the Buddha&#8217;s teachings with reservations &#8212; the right

clings, and changes the subject by propounding ten questions on the imponderables.
The Buddha bears patiently with him, and in answer to each question replies it is not

calculated to profit, were not concerned with his Dhamma, nor to the attainment of
Nirvana.

<!--l. 51096--><p class="indent" >   It is worthy of note that to the doctrinal questions the Buddha gave serious and

ample replies, sufficient to remove any reasonable grounds for differing from the
Dhamma he taught, but he refused to be drawn into any discussion that could
not lead to finality, such matters being outside of the Dhamma taught by
him.
<!--l. 51102--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught his doctrine of "soullessness" &#8212; anattaa &#8212; in two ways, and
by two methods demonstrated its truth and necessity if the major purpose of his
teachings was to be accomplished &#8212; the cessation of Dukkha. One was by the
analysis of constituents of "personality," the other was that any belief in a permanent
"self" would conflict with the causal law, and so deny the possibility of escape from
the wheel of becoming.
<!--l. 51111--><p class="indent" >   In regard to the analysis of personality, there are so many passages that deal with
this method that lack of space prevents more than a passing mention of them. Those
who wish to clarify their thinking on this point will have no difficulty in finding them.
The most common formula is to proceed with those who regard body as the self, or
the self as being in the body; so with feelings, with perception, with activities,
with consciousness. Such ones become obsessed with the idea, "I am the
body. The body is mine," or "I feel, I perceive, or there are activities, I
am conscious." "Feeling is mine, perception is mine, activities are mine,
consciousness is mine." But when these change and alter, owing to their unstable
nature, then arises sorrow, woe, and grief, due to their impermanence and
instability.
<!--l. 51125--><p class="indent" >   In SN 3.147, prior to an analysis as above, a certain one asked of the
Buddha:
<!--l. 51128--><p class="indent" >   "Pray, Lord, is there any body, feeling, perception, activity, or consciousness that
is permanent, stable by nature, lasting, unchanging, like unto the eternal, so that it
will stand fast?"
<!--l. 51132--><p class="indent" >   Then the Exalted One took up a pinch of dust on the tip of his nail, and said to
that brother:
<!--l. 51135--><p class="indent" >   "Even thus much material form, brother, is not permanent, stable, eternal, by
nature unchanging, like unto the eternal, so that it will stand fast. If even thus much
material form, brother, were permanent unchanging, then the living of the holy life
for the utter destruction of suffering would not be set forth. But inasmuch as even
thus much material form, brother, is not permanent, stable, eternal, by nature
unchanging, therefore the living of the holy life for the utter destruction of suffering
is set forth."
<!--l. 51144--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 3.147
<!--l. 51146--><p class="indent" >   We have on previous occasions written that no one doctrine taught by the
Buddha stands in isolation from any other or all of them. The Buddha&#8217;s reply to
Po.t.thapaada quoted above as to what he expounded is the key to them all, and the
connecting link between them &#8212; Dukkha, its origin, its cessation, and the way to its
cessation &#8212; was the Buddha&#8217;s only concern. All his doctrinal dissertations climaxed
in moral perfection as the way to Dukkha&#8217;s ceasing. The purpose of the analysis in
expounding the anatta doctrine is to understand the functioning and the
impermanence of the five aggregates that constitute the phenomenal "person." If this
be accomplished, the major delusion of a "self" that obsesses mankind generally will
be eliminated. With the elimination of this illusory "self," the root-cause of our

unhappiness is eliminated. The eternal thirst to satisfy its demands, the grasping
after sense-pleasures to please it, the clinging to phenomena that must fade
and die, is the source of Dukkha. So the doctrine of Anattaa becomes a
coordinating link with all other doctrines leading to the ethical life, and sorrow&#8217;s
ending.

disintegrates. The day comes when nothing at all remains of the man who once loved,
who once made a revolution. "My life, as I saw it, " wrote Marcel Proust, "presented
me with the spectacle of a succession of periods so occurring that, but for a
brief space of time, nothing of that which had been one&#8217;s sustaining force
continued to exist at all in that which followed it. I saw human life as a complex

brightly is now dark: it will never shed light again; it will no longer turn darkness
into daylight in the nighttime. In its useless state it will nevermore be able to shine
forth its miraculous rays to enable us to read and to see the other people and objects
that surround us. There it hangs in its socket. It cannot respond to our command to

<!--l. 51209--><p class="indent" >   What do we do? Replace the bulb with another one, of course! The used bulb that
is no longer a part of life is consigned to the trash can but the living force,
the electricity that gave it life now courses through the new bulb that now

been able to take along the life that flowed through it to its final resting
place.
<!--l. 51216--><p class="indent" >   So it is with our life. It is one and indivisible although its ever changing
forms are innumerable and perishable. There is in truth no death although
every form must die. We cannot permanently possess the life that flows
through us any more than the electric light bulb can own the current that

gave it light. Life alone is continuous ever seeking self-expression in new
forms.
<!--l. 51223--><p class="indent" >   So it is with what we call the soul. There is no substantial categorical entity as a
soul which belongs to us, and only to us, in death as it did in life. A human
individual is composed of psychological elements and a physical body. It is
consciousness which unifies the individual. This relationship between consciousness
and the psycho-physical existence often gives rise to the egocentric belief that we
possess an immortal unchanging soul, the destiny of which may be eternal happiness
or eternal misery according to the deeds of the personality it inhabits. Unfortunately
this idea is so deep-rooted in Western man, so near and dear to him that he naturally
experiences great difficulty in understanding any teaching contrary to this established
notion.
<!--l. 51235--><p class="indent" >   Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence
of such a separative soul, self or aatman. According to the teachings of the Buddha,
the idea of self is an imaginary false belief which has no corresponding reality and
produces harmful thoughts of "me" and "mine." Buddhism insists that the soul is not
a rigid unchanging entity but a living evolving organism. The soul, as Buddhists
understand it, is an ever growing, changing bundle of attributes or characteristics,
forming our character and personality. All of these manifested things, when
analyzed are found to lack continuous form or unchanging substance. In
reality there is nothing infinite apart from finite things. Whatever exists
is in a constant state of flux, through and through, like the flame of the
lamp, and all existence is in a process which continues to constantly renew
itself.
<!--l. 51250--><p class="indent" >   Our mind and its thoughts is essentially a stream of consciousness. Thought,
however, is not simply a physiological function but a kind of energy, something like
electricity. We should therefore strive to translate and activate this thought
energy in the world we live in, the life we live, in this existence where the
illusion of the separative self and the unchanging permanent soul can be
forever eliminated, no longer causing us to cling to forms that lack reality
and substance. The bonds of selfhood are then broken. New vistas appear
before us. A clearer unclouded understanding of the living forces of life is now
ours.

<!--l. 51268--><p class="indent" >   by Saantaraksita, and the Commentary by Kamalasila
<!--l. 51270--><p class="indent" >   Introductory Note
<!--l. 51272--><p class="indent" >   Saantaraksita (also called Saantiraksita) was born in a royal family in India, in
the 8th century C.E. He was one of the greatest Buddhist philosophers of his time
and a chancellor of the famous Naalanda University. His main opus, the
Tattva-Sa"mgraha, is a monumental work of philosophical criticism, comprising no
less than 3,646 stanzas. A very voluminous commentary on it, written by his pupil
Kamalasila, is likewise a work of great philosophical and critical acumen. Both
stanzas and commentary are extant in their Sanskrit original (discovered by G.
Buehler in 1873) and in a Tibetan translation. The Sanskrit text of both, in

Devanaagari script, was published in 1929 in the Gaekward&#8217;s Oriental Series, in two
volumes. In the same series a complete English translation of stanzas and
commentary by Dr. Ganganath Jha, appeared in 1937 and 1939, likewise in two
volumes of together 1,613 pages. The following extracts have been taken
from that translation, with some necessary changes, chiefly in Buddhist
terminology, which were made after consulting the Sanskrit original. A few more
extracts had been published earlier in Buddhism and God Idea (The Wheel No.
47).
<!--l. 51291--><p class="indent" >   It is difficult to identify Saantaraksita&#8217;s philosophical position with any of the
contemporary schools since his work shows features of Madhyamika, Vij~naa.navaada
as well as Sautrantika thought (the latter being a so-called Hinayaana school).
Probably Saantaraksita took an independent and eclectic position of his own. His
work and thought is still in need of careful research before it can be evaluated as it
deserves it.
<!--l. 51299--><p class="indent" >   Saantaraksita&#8217;s life had also an active side: together with Padmasambhava, he
founded the first monastery in Tibet, Samye, and had visited Tibet once
before.

<!--l. 51311--><p class="indent" >   Commentary. The doctrine of No-soul (nairaatmya) is called the Gateway to the
Highest Good because it is the means of entering Nirvana; it is Nirvana that is
meant by the term "Highest Good" (sivam). This doctrine causes fright
(bhayankaram) in those who uphold wrong beliefs, as for instance the soul-belief
(aatma-drs.ti), and are attached to unrealistic views. As it was said, "The
foolish man is always beset with such fears as &#8217;I am not, I may cease to

<!--l. 51327--><p class="indent" >   When one has made Soullessness one&#8217;s own experience, no defect can find a
footing in him, because it is its opposite; just as if there is a bright lamp, no darkness

<!--l. 51331--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; stanza 3338
<!--l. 51333--><p class="indent" >   Commentary. &#8212; It is, indeed, omniscience that follows from the removal
of the hindrance (caused) by the defilements and by cognizable things
(kles&#8217;a-j~neyaavara.na). It is because these very defilements, i.e., greed, hate, etc.,
obstruct an understanding of the real nature of things, that one speaks of the
hindrance consisting in the defilements. Though things are perceived, the
lack of capacity to discern them in all their aspects as to whether they are
to be rejected or accepted, and also the incapacity to conduct oneself (in
accordance with that discernment) &#8212; this is the hindrance in regard to

cognizables. Of these two, the hindrance caused by defilements is removed by
the direct experience (or confrontation; pratyaksaakara.na) of Soullessness
(nairaatmya). The hindrance in regard to cognizables is removed by the
dedicated, constant and long-continued absorption of that very doctrine of
Soullessness.1
<!--l. 51348--><p class="indent" >   All these defilements as greed, hatred and the rest, have their root in the wrong
notion of a soul (or self). They do not arise from external things; because, even, when
the external thing is there the said defilements will not appear without unwise
attention to them (ayonisau-manascchaaskaaram; Pali: ayoniso manasikaara); and
conversely, even when there is no external thing, the defilements will appear when
there is a (mental) confrontation with unwise imaginings. Thus, when presence and
absence of one thing do not follow the presence and absence of another,
the latter cannot be the cause of the former; if it were so, there would be
incongruities.
<!--l. 51359--><p class="indent" >   Defilements really proceed from the unrealistic notion of a self (Soul). For
instance, unless one seizes upon the notion of "I," one cannot have self-love. Nor can
love arise for objects taken as self or self&#8217;s property, unless one seizes upon
the notion of "mine" and on what is conducive to the arising of pleasure
to oneself. Likewise, hatred towards anything does not appear unless one
seizes upon objects as being repulsive (and hostile) to (what one takes to be)
one&#8217;s self and self&#8217;s property because there cannot be hatred against what is
not harmful to one&#8217;s self and its property, nor against what removes that
harm.
<!--l. 51370--><p class="indent" >   From all this it is clear that it is the notion of a soul or self, produced from time
beginningless by a repeated habituation to one&#8217;s (varying) nature, which generates
the grip on (what is regarded as) self&#8217;s property. These two produce self-love, which
again generates hate and other defilements. From this concatenation it is
abundantly clear that the defilements have their root in the clinging to self and its
property originating from an excessive habituation to the notion of a self or
soul.
<!--l. 51379--><p class="indent" >   Contrary to this idea of soul or self is the idea of no-soul or not-self,
because the latter rests upon a mode (of thinking) quite the reverse of the
former. It is incompatible too that both these ideas &#8212; of Soul and No-soul &#8212;
should be identical or co-exist in the same (thought-) continuity; because
they are as contrary to each other as the notions of "serpent" and "rope"
applied to the same object. Thus the doctrine of No-soul being contrary to
the doctrine of Soul, it becomes contrary to &#8212; incompatible with &#8212; the
defilements, too, i.e. greed, hatred and the rest. Consequently, when the
doctrine of No-soul, being incompatible with all defects and aberrations,
has been directly experienced, then its contrary &#8212; i.e., the whole host of
defilements as greed, etc. &#8212; cannot obtain any footing; just as darkness
ceases in a place flooded with light. It is in that way that the hindrance
caused by defilements is eliminated by the realization of the doctrine of
No-soul.
<!--l. 51396--><p class="indent" >   But if it were impossible for the idea of No-soul to appear in the (thought-)
continuity of a man whose defilements have not been destroyed, then there

would be no room at all for the arising of an understanding of No-soul. It is
however, a matter of common experience that the idea of No-soul presents itself
before all men. And if it is meditated upon it is capable of reaching great
intensity, just as the (lustful) thought about a young woman. Subsequently it
becomes as obvious as if one were to observe a directly perceived thing. How
then can it be impossible for the idea of No-soul to arise in the minds of
men?
<!--l. 51406--><p class="indent" >   The host of defilements, even in their most blatant forms, are unable to shake the
strength of the doctrine of No-Soul. Because being due to adventitious causes, the
defilements are never very firm. On the other hand, as to the idea of No-Soul, it
forms the very nature of things and is also helped by the means of cognition
(pramaa.na); hence it is strong and firm.
<!--l. 51413--><p class="indent" >   It has been argued that even for those who have cognised the doctrine of No-Soul
through inference (anumaana), the defilements, as greed etc., do appear. &#8212; But this
(objection) is not conclusive; because it is the knowledge acquired by meditation
(bhaavanaa-maya) which, through its clarity and distinctness, directly envisages
soul-less (impersonal) things in a non-conceptual way; and having as its object
well-ascertained things, it is not erroneous. It is such an understanding of No-Soul
that can entirely uproot the notion of a Soul (or Self) and has, on that account,
been described (in the stanza commented upon) as being opposed to it.
This knowledge is not of the kind derived from study and reflective thought
(s&#8217;ruta-cintaa-maya).
<!--l. 51425--><p class="indent" >   From the realization of the Soullessness of all things as proclaimed by him,
follows the cessation of the entire flood of defilements which originated from
personality-belief. It is from the view-point of a self and self&#8217;s property that the
notion of a "being" proceeds. From the conceit of "I" and "Mine" all defilements
come forth.
<!--l. 51432--><p class="indent" >   This realization of No-Soul is inimical to the view of an (abiding) "being." When
the habitual notions of a self and self&#8217;s property have been eliminated by the former,
the latter, too, disappears. The accumulation of defilements rooted in it, will vanish
when their cause is absent: And if the defilements are absent, there will be no further
rebirth being caused by them.
<!--l. 51439--><p class="indent" >   There being absolute liberation from birth, this state is spoken of as the Final
Goal. Thus the perception of No-Soul is the door to the Unrivalled Good. All other
philosophers have held that Liberation follows from the cessation of egotism
(aha"mkaara). But if there is a Soul, this egotism can never cease, Because its
efficient cause would always be there; so the objective of that cause would not be
abrogated. If it were abrogated, there would be a negation of it, which would mean a
complete volte-face on their part.
<!--l. 51448--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; stanzas 3488-3494
<!--l. 51450--><p class="indent" >   Commentary. It is accepted that liberation consists in the absolute cessation of
the series of rebirths. But the only means of attaining this consists in the teachings of
the Blessed Lord, as it is only here, and nowhere else, that we have the doctrine of
No-Soul, which is the sole destroyer of defilements that are the source of rebirth. All
other philosophers are wedded to the false doctrine of a Soul. Thus it is the word of
the Blessed Lord alone which, as being the means of obtaining the highest good, can

be the indicator of Dharma; hence it is this teaching alone that should be depended
upon by all who seek their own welfare. &#8212; Such is the purport of the whole
text...
<!--l. 51462--><p class="indent" >   It might be argued that "the Yogin does abrogate it." But if the Soul were to be
abrogated, it could be repudiated only in the words "it does not exist," as
otherwise there would be no point in repudiating it. Because if, after having
accepted the concept of a Soul, one were to repudiate it as the "source of
pain," then such repudiation would be useless, because the repudiation of a
thing is done for the purpose of abandoning it; and no abandoning would be
possible of what one regards as being one&#8217;s ever-lasting Self; hence that
repudiation would be useless. Nor can those other philosophers repudiate the Soul
as being non-existent; because, having regarded it as existent, if they now
regard it as non-existent, this would mean a complete volte-face on their
part.

<!--l. 51548--><p class="indent" >   Attaa
<!--l. 51550--><p class="indent" >   The first two senses of attaa distinguished above may be assumed to have
been ordinary usage and no subject of disagreement between the Buddha
and his opponents (se D. 9, cited below). The last two are of minor import
and need not concern us beyond noting them. The characteristic of Not-self
(anatta-lakkha.na) deals with the third, the unidentifiable entity that is conceived
and sought and made the subject of a certain class of views, namely, self-views
(attaanudi.t.thi).
<!--l. 51558--><p class="indent" >   Many suttas classify the conflicting notions of the nature of self held by opponents
of the Buddha. It could be, and apparently was, for instance, claimed that it had
materiality, or was immaterial; or both, or neither; was percipient of oneness, or of
plurality, or of the limited or of the measureless; was eternal, or uneternal, or both, or
neither; had only pleasure, or only pain, or both or neither; each of these theories
being maintained by its propounder as "the only truth and all else wrong"
(M. 102, etc.). Or else it could be described as having materiality either
limited or infinite, or as immaterial and either limited or infinite. And then
whichever of these four is adopted, it may be seen as such now, or due to
be such (upon rebirth), or in this way "Though it is not yet real, still I
shall contrive for its reality" (D. 15/vol. ii. 64). All these rationalized views
(di.t.thi) stem from uncritical acceptance or overlooking of an underlying
tendency (anusaya), or fetter (sa"myo jana) &#8212; a natural predisposition &#8212; to
regard, to identify, some aspect or other, in the situation of perceiving a
percept, as "this is mine" or "this is what I am" or "this is my self" (e.g. M.
22). These two levels &#8212; the self-view and the I-sense &#8212; are respectively
what are called the "(lower or immediate) fetter of views" (di.t.thi-sa"myo
jana) and the "(higher or remoter) fetter of conceit" (maana-sa"myo jana).
The first is abandoned with the attainment of the first stage of realization
(the path of stream-entry) while the second is abandoned only with the
fourth and final stage (the path of arahantship: see D. 33). It may be noted

here in parenthesis that the rendering of maana by "pride," though not
wrong, severs the semantic relationship with ma~n~nati and ma~n~nanaa,
which it is most important to preserve intact for the understanding of this
situation.
<!--l. 51591--><p class="indent" >   The overlooked fundamental conceit "I am" (asmi-maana) &#8212; a mirage that, in
the act of perceiving, is conceived will fulfil its counterpart, the intuitive sense of
lack, which is craving &#8212; in the basic ontological structure of ordinary perception
provokes the ordinary man with no knowledge of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching to indulge in
uncritical speculation about what this may be that "I am," and consequently to
build up self-theories. He perceives (sa~njaanaati): but the very act of his
perceiving is tendentious so that he simultaneously conceives (ma~n~nati) his
percepts with an I-tendency. But a stream-enterer, who has attained the first
stage of realization, has direct acquaintance (abhijanaati) where the ordinary
man has perception, owing to which fact the former has the possibility of
hastening his attainment of arahatship; and an arahant has no more conceivings
(ma~n~nanaa) at all. So long as a man leaves intact this fundamental tendency
to conceive in the very act of perceiving, accompanied by the tendency to
formulate views, he will look for answers to the questions that these two
tendencies together prompt him to ask, and he will invent them and try to prove
them:
<!--l. 51612--><p class="indent" >   "This is how he gives unreasoned attention (ayoniso-manasikaara): &#8217;Was I in the
past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having
been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in
the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future?
Having been what, what shall I be in the future?&#8217; Or else he is doubtful in
himself about the presently arisen extent thus: &#8217;Am I? Am I not? What
am I? How am I? Whence will this creature have come? Whither will it be
bound?&#8217;
<!--l. 51621--><p class="indent" >   "When he gives unreasoned attention in this way one of the six kinds of view
arises in him: the view &#8217;A self exists for me&#8217; arises as true and established, or the
view &#8217;No self exists for me&#8217;... or the view &#8217;I perceive self with self&#8217;... or the view
&#8217;I perceive not-self with self&#8217;... or the view &#8217;I perceive self with not-self"
arises in him as true and established; or else he has some such view as &#8217;It
is this my self that speaks and feels and that experiences here and there
the ripening of good and bad actions; but this my self is permanent, ever
lasting, eternal, not subject to change, and it will endure as long as eternity.&#8217;
This field of views is called the thicket of views, the wilderness of views, the
vacillation of views, the fetter of views. No untaught ordinary man bound
by the fetter of views is freed from birth, aging and death, from sorrow
and lamentation, pain, grief, and despair: he is not freed from suffering, I
say."
<!--l. 51636--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; M. 2/vol. i, 8
<!--l. 51638--><p class="indent" >   In assuming that "I was" etc. cannot be analyzed, all these philosophical systems
attempt to settle with unilateral certainty the dialectic questions "what was I?" and
the rest and to dispose of them on an inadequate ontological basis of self-identity
without querying how the questions come to be put in the first place or what is the

structural nature of being. But any one answer, "I am this" cannot as it
happens be decisively established over its contrary opposite, though it can
be fortified by arguments, more or less logical or emotional, introducing
"my self" and defining relations between it and what it is considered not
to be, endowing it then with certain qualities and values and with either
eternal or temporary permanence according to bent. The impossibility of
establishing absolutely any one of these views as the only truth may lead to abuse
and even to violence in the end, since it is often thought important to be
right.
<!--l. 51655--><p class="indent" >   The pre-rational conceit "I am" (asmi-maana) is a "fetter but not a view" (Ps.
Di.t.thikathaa/vol. i, 143). To perceive is to recognize and identify (see Vis. Ch.
XIV/p. 462). In perceiving a percept the "untaught ordinary man" automatically
conceives in the positional terms of "I," which then must seem involved in an
I-relationship to the percept: either as identical with it, or as contained in it or as
separate from it, or owning it as "mine." That relationship so conceived is relished
(favored and approved) through want of full knowledge of the situation (M. 1; cf. M.
49).
<!--l. 51666--><p class="indent" >   The rational self-view (attaanudi.t.thi) is both a "fetter and a view." Though the
conceit "I am" is normally associated with the tendency to formulate views, these
views need not by any means be definitely formulated; but whenever they are,
none can be specifically described without reference to the five categories
affected by clinging (upaadanakkhandha: see S. XXII, 47 cited below). For
that reason they can all be reduced to one of the types of what is called the
"embodiment view" (sakkaya-di.tthi, from sat (or sa"m) plus kaaya = "true (or
existent) body") which is set up schematically as follows: "The untaught
ordinary man who disregards the ariyas... sees materiality (ruupa) as self, or
self as possessed of materiality, or materiality in self, or self in materiality.
[And likewise with feeling (vedanaa), perception (sa~n~naa), formations
(sankhaaraa), and consciousness (vi~n~naana]" (M. 44/vol. i, 300). These four
self-identifications embracing the five categories make twenty types. For each of the
four basic modes of identifying, the Pa.tisambhidaamagga gives a simile as
follows:
<!--l. 51685--><p class="indent" >   "How does he see (say, materiality) as self?... Just as if a man saw a
lighted lamp&#8217;s flame and color as identical thus &#8217;What the flame is, that
the color is; what the color is that the flame is&#8217;... How does he see self as
possessed of (say, materiality)?... Just as if there were a tree possessed of
shade such that a man might say &#8217;This is the tree, this is the shade; the
tree is one, the shade another; but this tree is possessed of this shade in
virtue of this shade&#8217;... How does he see (say, materiality) in self?... Just as if
there were a scented flower such that a man might say &#8217;This is the flower,
this is the scent; the flower is one, the scent another; but the scent is in
this flower&#8217;... How does he see self in (say, materiality)?... Just as if a gem
were placed in a casket such that a man might say &#8217;This is the gem, this
is the casket; the gem is one, the casket another; but this gem is in this
casket.&#8217;"
<!--l. 51700--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Ps. Di.t.thikathaa/vol. i, 144-5

<!--l. 51702--><p class="indent" >   Self so viewed is then taken either as eternal thus "This is self, this the world;
after death I shall be permanent, ever-lasting..." (M. 22 cited below) or as
temporarily permanent but eventually annihilated, for instance; thus "As soon as this
self is annihilated... that is peace..." (Iti, II. ii, 12). All possible views of
whatever shade are again classified under sixty-two types in the first Sutta of
the Diigha-Nikaaya called Brahmajaala Sutta or the "Divine Net." In this
"net" all possible views are "caught" and so it can be seen how they come to
be.
<!--l. 51713--><p class="indent" >   Now all these views &#8212; and all these standpoints for views (di.t.thi.t.thana) &#8212; are
formed (or conditioned; sankhata) because "it is impossible that anyone shall
experience (them) apart from contact (phassa)... and with contact as condition,
feeling; with feeling as condition, craving (ta.nhaa); with craving as condition,
clinging (upaadaana); with clinging as condition, being (bhava); with being
as condition, birth; with birth as condition aging and death come to be,
and also sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief and despair; that is how there
is an origin to this whole aggregate-mass of suffering" (D. 1/vol. i, 43-5).
The structure of the conceit "I am" and the views to which it gives rise, is,
in fact nothing else than the structure of being, the structure of what is
"impermanent, formed, and dependently originated." "A Tathaagata understands
that thus &#8217;(These views) are formed and (consequently) gross; but there is
cessation of formations: there is that.&#8217; By knowing and seeing the escape
from them a Tathaagata transcends them (tad upaativatto)" (M. 102/vol. ii,
229-30).
<!--l. 51732--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha explains how he uses the word attaa (self) in the second sense,
namely, the "person" or "individual" noted above:
<!--l. 51736--><p class="indent" >   "There are these three kinds of acquisition of self (atta-patilaabha): gross,
constituted of mind, and immaterial... The first has materiality and consists of the
four great entities (elements of earth, water, fire, and air), and consumes physical
food; the second is constituted by mind with all the limbs and lacking no faculty; the
third consists of perception... I teach the Doctrine (dhamma) for the abandoning of
acquisitions of self in order that in you, who put the teaching into practice, defiling
ideas may be abandoned and cleansing ideas increase, and that you, by realization
yourselves here and now with direct knowledge, enter upon and abide in the fullness
of understanding&#8217;s perfection... If it is thought that to do that is an unpleasant
abiding, that is not so: on the contrary, by doing that there is gladness, happiness,
tranquillity, mindfulness, full awareness and a pleasant (blissful) abiding... These are
worldly usages, worldly language, worldly terms of communication, worldly
descriptions by which a Tathaagata communicates without misapprehending
them."

<!--l. 51759--><p class="indent" >   Definitions of Anattaa
<!--l. 51761--><p class="indent" >   The first discourse given by the Buddha after his Enlightenment set out the Four
Noble Truths. The second stated the characteristic of Not-self as follows: "Bhikkhus,

materiality is not self. Were materiality self, then this materiality would not lead to
affliction, and one could have it of materiality &#8217;Let my materiality be thus,
let my materiality be not thus.&#8217; And it is because materiality is not self
that materiality leads to affliction and one cannot have it of materiality
&#8217;Let my materiality be thus, let my materiality be not thus&#8217; (And similarly
with feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness)." The Buddha then
continued:
<!--l. 51772--><p class="indent" >   "How do you conceive this, bhikkhus, is materiality permanent or impermanent?"
&#8212; "Impermanent, Lord." &#8212; "Is what is impermanent pleasure or pain?" &#8212; "Pain,
Lord." &#8212; "Is what is impermanent, painful and subject to change fit to be seen thus
&#8217;This is mine, this is what I am, this is my self&#8217;?" &#8212; "No, Lord." (And similarly with
the other four categories.)
<!--l. 51781--><p class="indent" >   "Consequently, bhikkhus, any kind of materiality (feeling, perception,
formations, consciousness) whatever, whether past, future or presently arisen, in
oneself or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, is all
(to be seen thus) &#8217;This is not mine, this is not what I am, this is not my
self.&#8217; That is how it should be seen with right understanding as it actually
is."
<!--l. 51788--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; S. XXII, 58/vol. iii, 66
<!--l. 51790--><p class="indent" >   The characteristic is stated more succinctly in this way: "The eye (ear, nose,
tongue, body, and mind, and six external bases) is impermanent; what is
impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not self" (S. XXXV, 1/vol. iv, 1); or
"All is not-self. And what is the all that is not self? The eye is not self..." (S. XXXV,
45/vol. iv, 28); or again "All things (dhamma) are not-self" (e.g. Dh. XX, 7/v. 279).
The canonical commentary, the Pa.tisambhidaamagga, adds "Materiality (etc.) is
not-self in the sense that it has no core (saara)" (Ps. ~Naanakathaa/vol. i,
37).
<!--l. 51801--><p class="indent" >   Aacariya Buddhagohosa&#8217;s definitions are as follows: "The characteristics of
impermanence and suffering are known whether Buddhas arise or not; but that
of not-self is not known unless there is a Buddha;... for the knowledge of
it is the province of none but a Buddha" (Aayatana Vibhanga A./VbhA.
49-50). "The Blessed One in some instances shows not-self-ness through
impermanence (as in M. 148 cited below), in some through suffering (as in
S. XXII, 59 cited above), and in some through both (as in S. XXII, 76 or
XXXV, 1 cited above). Why is that? While impermanence and suffering are
both evident, not-self is unevident" (MA. ad M. 22/vol. ii, 113); for "the
characteristic of not-self seems unevident, obscure, arcane, impenetrable,
hard to illustrate and hard to describe" (VbhA, 49). He distinguishes "the
not-self and the characteristic of not-self... Those same five categories (which
are impermanent and suffering) are not-self because of the words &#8217;What is
suffering is not self.&#8217; Why? Because there is no exercising mastery over them.
The mode of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery (avasavattana) is
the characteristic of not-self" (Vis. Ch. XXI/p. 640). Again "(The eye) is
not-self in the sense of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery over it. Or
alternatively, because there is no exercising of mastery over it in the following
three instances, namely, &#8217;Let it when arisen not reach presence&#8217; or &#8217;Let it

when already reached presence not age&#8217; or &#8217;Let it when already reached
aging not dissolve&#8217;; it is void of that mode of exercise of mastery, therefore
it is not-self for four reasons: because it is void, because it has no owner,
because it cannot be done with as one wants, and because it denies self"
(VbhA. 48; cf. MA. ii, 113). The Vibhaavini-Tiikaa (commentary to the
Abhidhammattha-sangaha) says "Not-self is the absence (abhaava) of self as
conjectured by other teachers; that not-self as a characteristic is the characteristic of
not-self."

insistencies and underlying tendencies, for the stilling of all formations, for the

distinguishing each one; and in this way "Contact is one, feeling is another" and so
on, distinguishing each one, "When the resolution of the compact is effected" means
that what is compact as a mass (samuuha) or as a function (kicca) or as a supporting
object (aaramma.na) has been analysed. For when material and non-material
dhammas have arisen mutually steadying each other (i.e., "name and form"), then,
owing to misinterpreting (abhinivesa) that as a unity, compactness of mass is
assumed through failure to subject formations (sankhaaraa) to pressure. And likewise
compactness of function is assumed when, although definite differences exist in such
and such dhammas, functions, they are taken as one. And likewise compactness of
supporting-object is assumed when, although differences exist in the ways in which
dhammas that take supporting-objects make them so, those supporting-objects
are taken as one. But when they are seen after resolving them by means
of knowledge into these elements, they disintegrate like froth subjected to
compression by the hand. They are mere dhammas occurring dependent on
conditions and void. That is how the characteristic of not-self becomes more
evident.

there is no "one who feels" (vedaka: Ch. XVII/p. 576). The simile of the blind
man able to walk who mounts on his shoulder the cripple who can see so
that together they can travel as they like is used to illustrate the radical
contingency of dhammas (Ch. XVIII/p. 596), and contingency also forms
the subject of a verse quoted from the Mahaa-Niddesa (Vis, Ch. XX/p.
624-5).

Voidness is variously classified in the Pa.tisambhidaamagga Su~n~nakathaa. The

<!--l. 52024--><p class="indent" >   One discourse shows how the tendency to perceive in terms of "I" underlies

theories of self:
<!--l. 52027--><p class="indent" >   "Whatever sama.nas or brahma.nas see self in its various types, all of them see
the five categories affected by clinging, on one or other of them. What five? Here an
untaught ordinary man who disregards the ariyas, is unconversant with their teaching
and undisciplined in it... sees materiality as self, or self as possessed of materiality, or
materiality in self, or self in materiality; he sees feeling... perception... formations...
consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or self in consciousness, or
consciousness in self. So he has this way of seeing (samanupassanaa) and also this
attitude (adhigata) &#8217;I am.&#8217; When there is the attitude &#8217;I am&#8217; then there is the
organization (avakkanti) of the five faculties (indriya) of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and
body. There is mind (mano), and there are ideas (dhamma), and there is the
element of ignorance (avijja-dhaatu). When an untaught ordinary man is
touched by whatever is felt born of the contact of ignorance, it occurs to him
&#8217;I am&#8217; and &#8217;I am this&#8217; and &#8217;I shall be&#8217; and &#8217;I shall not be&#8217; and &#8217;I shall be
formed&#8217; and &#8217;I shall be formless&#8217; and &#8217;I shall be percipient&#8217; and &#8217;I shall be
non-percipient&#8217; and &#8217;I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient.&#8217; Now in
the case of the well-taught disciple of the ariyas, while the five faculties
persist in the same way, nevertheless ignorance is abandoned and knowledge
(vijjaa) arisen in him. With the fading out of ignorance and the arising of
knowledge it no more occurs to him &#8217;I am&#8217; and... &#8217;I shall be neither percipient nor
non-percipient.&#8217;"

<!--l. 52067--><p class="indent" >   Again, when the Elder Khemaka was questioned by other elders, he said:
<!--l. 52069--><p class="indent" >   "I do not see in these five categories affected by clinging any self or self&#8217;s

contrary I still have the attitudes (adhigata) &#8217;I am&#8217; with respect to these five
categories affected by clinging, although I do not say &#8217;I am this&#8217; (with respect to
them)... I do not say &#8217;I am materiality&#8217; or &#8217;I am feeling&#8217; or &#8217;I am perception&#8217; or
&#8217;I am formations&#8217; or &#8217;I am consciousness,&#8217; nor do I say &#8217;I am apart from

affected by clinging, although I do not say &#8217;I am this&#8217; (with respect to them).
Although a disciple of the ariyas may have abandoned the five immediate
fetters (of embodiment-view, uncertainty, misapprehension of virtue and
duty, desire for sensuality, and ill will, and so reached the third stage of
realization, the path of non-return), still his conceit &#8217;I am,&#8217; desire (chanda) &#8217;I am,&#8217;
underlying tendency &#8217;I am,&#8217; with respect to the five categories affected by
clinging remains unabolished. Later he abides contemplating rise and fall

thus &#8217;Such is materiality, such its origin, such its disappearance,&#8217; (and so
with the rest), and by so doing his conceit &#8217;I am&#8217; eventually comes to be
abolished."
<!--l. 52089--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; S. XXII, 89/vol. iii, 128-32 abbr.
<!--l. 52091--><p class="indent" >   The Continuity of the Person
<!--l. 52093--><p class="indent" >   On a certain occasion it had been stated by the Buddha how, when a
man knows and sees the five categories, whatever their mode, thus "this is
not mine, this is not what I am, this is not by self," there come to be no
more underlying tendencies to treat this body with its consciousness, and all
external signs, in terms of "I" and "Mine" (ahankaara-mamankaara). Then in
a certain bhikkhu&#8217;s mind this thought arose "So, it seems, materiality is
not self, nor are feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. Then
what self will the action done by the not-self touch?"&#8217; (M. 109/vol. iii, 18-9).
He was rebuked for ignoring the Buddha&#8217;s teaching of dependency. Again,
when the Buddha was asked by the naked ascetic Kassapa whether suffering
was of one&#8217;s own making or of another&#8217;s or both or neither, the Buddha
replied "Do not put it like that." When asked whether there was no suffering
or whether the Buddha neither knew nor saw it, the Buddha replied that
there was, and that he both knew and saw it. He then said "Kassapa, if
one asserts that &#8217;He who makes (it) feels (it): being one existent from the
beginning, his suffering is of his own making,&#8217; then one arrives at eternalism.
But if one asserts that one makes (it), another feels (it); being one existent
crushed out by feeling, his suffering is of another&#8217;s making,&#8217; then one arrives at
annihilationism. Instead of resorting to either extreme a Tathaagata teaches the
Dhamma by the middle way (by dependent origination)" (S. XII, 17/vol. ii,
20).
<!--l. 52118--><p class="indent" >   Now what is called an "acquisition of self" (atta-pa.tilaabha; see end of section on
Attaa, above) &#8212; in other words, the person or individuality &#8212; may be physical or
mental or immaterial according to the plane of being (sensual, material,
or immaterial) in which rebirth has taken place. Also from birth to birth
any one kind can succeed and so must exclude any other. That being so, it
cannot be successfully argued that only one of the three kinds is true and the
others wrong; one can only say that the term for each one does not apply to
the other two. Just as with milk from a cow, curd from milk, butter from
curd, ghee from butter, and fine-extract of ghee from ghee, the term for
each applies only to that and not to any of the others (but they are not
disconnected). That is how there are these "worldly usages... by which a
Tathaagata communicates without misapprehending (them)" (D. 9/vol. i,
201-2).
<!--l. 52134--><p class="indent" >   "Individual self-hood" (atta-bhaava) is what the physical body is called; or it is
simply the pentad of categories, since it is actually only a descriptive device derived
(upaada-pa~n~natti) upon the pentad of categories (Vis. Ch. IX/p. 310). "Here when
the categories are not fully known, there is naming (abhidhaana) of them and of the
consciousness as &#8217;self,&#8217; that is, the physical body or alternatively the five categories...
(it is) presence (sabbhaava) as a mere description in the case of what is called a
&#8217;being&#8217; (bhaata), though in the ultimate sense the &#8217;being&#8217; is non-existent

(avijjamaana)" (VisA. 298).
<!--l. 52145--><p class="indent" >   A Tathaagata is indescribable in terms of being or of consciousness:
<!--l. 52147--><p class="indent" >   "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu&#8217;s mind (citta) is... liberated, the gods... when they
seek him do not find the consciousness of one who is thus-gone (tathaagata) with
anything as its support. Why is that? One thus-gone is here and now no longer
knowable, I say. So saying, so proclaiming, I have been baselessly, vainly, falsely, and
wrongly misrepresented by some sama.nas and brahma.nas thus, &#8217;The sama.na
Gotama is one who leads away (to loss: venayika) he describes an existent creature&#8217;s
annihilation, loss, non-being.&#8217; As I am not, as I do not proclaim, so I have been...
wrongly misrepresented."
<!--l. 52157--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; M. 22/vol. i, 140; cf. 72/vol. i, 487
<!--l. 52159--><p class="indent" >   For these and other reasons the Buddha refused to answer the "ten undecided
matters" (avyaakata) ending with the four logical questions whether after death a
Tathaagata is, is not, both is and is not, neither is nor is not (see, e.g.. S. XLIV;
M. 72). These ten, and some others as well not answered, all contain some
concealed assumption, in fact, which either of the answers, yes or no, would alike
confirm.
<!--l. 52167--><p class="indent" >   Arguments Used Against Self-Theories.
<!--l. 52169--><p class="indent" >   "Self" in any form, particular or absolute, one or many, cannot be conceived apart
from identification, without which no meaningful statement can be made about it...
and any identification is always wrong: yena yena hi ma~n~nati tato ta"m hoti
a~n~nathaa (Ud. p. 33). There are three principal types of argument used by the
Buddha, with which he exposes self-theories by means of the very basis on
which they are built. These are: (1) "affliction" (or insusceptibility to the
exercise of mastery), (2) "impermanence" and (3) "non-existence" (of the kind
postulated.)
<!--l. 52180--><p class="indent" >   If self is identified with any of the five categories indiscriminately or with, say, the
eye, then since one cannot have any of these as one wishes in this way "Let it be
thus, let it be not thus" one suffers affliction by it and so cannot claim to
have mastery over it; consequently it cannot rightly be called "self" (M.
35).
<!--l. 52187--><p class="indent" >   If it is claimed that self is consciousness, then it can be shown that because
consciousness always arises dependent on impermanent conditions, it too is
impermanent (M. 38; 109). Again, if self is identified with feeling, it can be asked:
With pleasant or unpleasant or neutral feeling? Whichever is admitted, then since the
three kinds of feeling come and go (for when one is present the others are absent),
self must come and go too. Consequently such a self is likewise untenable (D.
15).
<!--l. 52196--><p class="indent" >   If, on the other hand, it is claimed that self is "not feeling and has nothing to do
with it," then it can be asked whether, where there is no feeling at all, one can say "I
am," and no affirmative answer can be given (for without feeling there would be no
experience on which the mirage "I am," depends). Again, if it is claimed that self,
"while not feeling is not without experience of feeling since it feels and is inseparable
from the idea of feeling," then it can be asked whether, if feeling altogether
ceased, one could say "I am this," and no affirmative answer can be given (for
without feeling there could be no means of identifying what "I am"; (D.

15).
<!--l. 52209--><p class="indent" >   This last argument, among others, precludes predicating attaa of nibbaana, which
is called "cessation of perception and feeling" (see e.g. Iti. II, ii, 7).
<!--l. 52213--><p class="indent" >   The characteristic of not-self, unlike those of impermanence and suffering, does
not have its opposite applied to extinction: attaa cannot be, and never is, applied to
nibbaana.
<!--l. 52217--><p class="indent" >   Anatta as a Subject for Contemplation and Basis for Judgment
<!--l. 52219--><p class="indent" >   When asked how he taught his followers, the Buddha replied:
<!--l. 52221--><p class="indent" >   "I discipline my hearers thus...: &#8217;Bhikkhus, materiality is impermanent, and so are
feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness; materiality is not-self, and so are
feeling, perception, formations and consciousness. All formations are impermanent;
all things (dhammaa) are not-self.&#8217;"
<!--l. 52227--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; M. 35/vol. i, 230
<!--l. 52229--><p class="indent" >   The contemplation is described as follows:
<!--l. 52231--><p class="indent" >   "What is perception of not-self? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or to the root
of a tree, or to a room that is void, considers thus: "Eye is not self, forms are not self,
ear... sounds... nose... odors... tongue... flavours... body... tangibles... mind...
ideas are not self. That is how he abides contemplating not-self in these six
in-oneself-and-external bases."
<!--l. 52238--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; A. X. 60/vol. v, 109
<!--l. 52240--><p class="indent" >   Whatever is conditioned should be judged according to its actual nature of
impermanence and contingency, no matter whether even a pleasant abiding
(sukha-vihaara) or a quiet abiding (santa-vihaara). "Whatever is there to be included
as materiality or feeling or perception or formations or consciousness, such things
(dhammaa) he sees as impermanent, as suffering, as ailment, as a cancer, as a dart,
as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self" (M.
64/vol. i, 435; A. IV. 124/vol. ii, 128: elaborated by Ps. quoted at Vis. Ch. XX/p.
611). And again, "Whatever is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned it,
that will be long for your welfare and happiness. What is not yours? Materiality is
not yours..." (M. 22/vol. i, 140). "When a bhikkhu abides much with his mind
fortified by perception of not-self in suffering, his mind is rid of conceits that treat in
terms of &#8217;I&#8217; and &#8217;mine&#8217; this body with its consciousness, and all external
signs" (A. VII, 46/vol. iv, 53). And "when a bhikkhu sees six rewards it
should be enough for him to establish perception of not-self unlimitedly in all
formations. What six? &#8217;I shall be aloof (atammaya) from the world of all
(from all the world); I shall be no more impeded by treating in terms of
"I" and likewise of "mine"; I shall come to possess knowledge not shared
(by all); and I shall see clearly causation, and also causally arisen things&#8217;"
(A. VI, 104/vol. iii, 444). "When a man knows and sees the eye (etc.) as
not self, his fetters come to be abolished" (S. XXXV, 55/vol. iv, 31-2) and
"Perception of not-self reaches the abolition of the conceit &#8217;I am,&#8217; which is
extinction (nibbaana) here and now" (Ud. IV, i). Lastly, "It is impossible
that anyone with right view should see any thing as self" (M. 115/vol. iii,
64).
<!--l. 52270--><p class="indent" >   The perception of not-self is the third of the "Eighteen Principal Insights"
(mahaa-vipassanaa; see article Anicca), of which the Visuddhi magga says "One who

maintains in being the contemplation of not-self abandons perception of self" and
"contemplation of not-self and contemplation of voidness are one in meaning and
only the letter is different" (Vis. Ch. XX/p. 628) since "one who maintains in being
the contemplation of not-self abandons misinterpreting (abhinivesa)." On the
development of the contemplation of not-self based on rise and fall given in the
Visuddhimagga (Ch. XXI) see article Anicca.
<!--l. 52281--><p class="indent" >   The Pa.tisambhidaamagga connects this contemplation specially with the faculty
of understanding (pa~n~naa), and it is there called the third "Gateway to
Liberation." "When one gives attention to not-self, the understanding faculty is
outstanding" (see article Anicca).
