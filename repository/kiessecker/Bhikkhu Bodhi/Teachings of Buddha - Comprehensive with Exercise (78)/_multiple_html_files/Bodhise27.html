<!--l. 71229--><p class="noindent" >The precepts are a condensed form of Buddhist ethical practice. They are often
compared with the ten commandments of Christianity, however, the precepts are
different in two respects: First, they are to be taken as recommendations, not
commandments. This means the individual is encouraged to use his/her own
intelligence to apply these rules in the best possible way. Second, it is the spirit of the
precepts -not the text- that counts, hence, the guidelines for ethical conduct must be
seen in the larger context of the Eightfold Path.
<!--l. 71238--><p class="indent" >   The first five precepts are mandatory for every Buddhist, although the fifth
precept is often not observed, because it bans the consumption of alcohol. Precepts
no. six to ten are laid out for those in preparation for monastic life and for devoted
lay people unattached to families. The eight precepts put together number eight and
nine and omit the tenth. Lay people may observe the eight precepts on Buddhist
festival days. Ordained Theravada monks undertake no less than 227 precepts, which
are not listed here.
<!--l. 71247--><p class="indent" >   I undertake to observe the precept to abstain from ...
<!--l. 71249--><p class="indent" >   ...harming living beings.
<!--l. 71251--><p class="indent" >   ...taking things not freely given.
<!--l. 71253--><p class="indent" >   ...sexual misconduct.
<!--l. 71255--><p class="indent" >   ...false speech.
<!--l. 71257--><p class="indent" >   ...intoxicating drinks and drugs causing heedlessness.
<!--l. 71259--><p class="indent" >   ...taking untimely meals.
<!--l. 71261--><p class="indent" >   ...dancing, singing, music and watching grotesque mime.
<!--l. 71263--><p class="indent" >   ...use of garlands, perfumes and personal adornment.
<!--l. 71265--><p class="indent" >   ...use of high seats.
<!--l. 71267--><p class="indent" >   ...accepting gold or silver.
<!--l. 71269--><p class="indent" >   (adapted from The Word of the Buddha, Niyamatolika, The Buddhist Publication
Society, 1971, p xii)
<!--l. 71272--><p class="indent" >   The above phrasing of the precepts is very concise and leaves much open to
interpretation. One might ask, for example, what exactly constitutes false speech,
what are untimely meals, what constitutes sexual misconduct, or whether a glass of
wine causes heedlessness. And, the grotesque mime watching of the seventh precept
sounds perhaps a bit outdated. The Buddhist master Thich Nath Hanh has
formulated The Five Mindfulness Trainings, which are an adaptation of the first five
Buddhist precepts. These are practised by Buddhists of the Lam Te Dhyana
school. By virtue of their sensible phrasing and their relevance to modern
lifestyle, these "trainings" provide a valuable foundation of ethics for all of
humanity.

<!--l. 71284--><p class="indent" >   The Five Mindfulness Trainings (according to Thich Nath Hanh,
www.plumvillage.org)
<!--l. 71286--><p class="indent" >   -First Training-
<!--l. 71288--><p class="indent" >   Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I am committed to
cultivating compassion and learning ways to protect the lives of people, animals,
plants, and minerals. I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to
condone any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of
life.
<!--l. 71294--><p class="indent" >   -Second Training-
<!--l. 71296--><p class="indent" >   Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation, social injustice, stealing, and
oppression, I am committed to cultivate loving kindness and learn ways to work for
the well-being of people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am committed to practice
generosity by sharing my time, energy, and material resources with those who are in
real need. I am determined not to steal and not to possess anything that should
belong to others. I will respect the property of others, but I will prevent others
from profiting from human suffering or the suffering of other species on
Earth.
<!--l. 71306--><p class="indent" >   -Third Training-
<!--l. 71308--><p class="indent" >   Aware of the suffering caused by sexual misconduct, I am committed to cultivate
responsibility and learn ways to protect the safety and integrity of individuals,
couples, families, and society. I am determined not to engage in sexual relations
without love and a long-term commitment. To preserve the happiness of
myself and others, I am determined to respect my commitments and the
commitments of others. I will do everything in my power to protect children from
sexual abuse and to prevent couples and families from being broken by sexual
misconduct.
<!--l. 71317--><p class="indent" >   -Fourth Training-
<!--l. 71319--><p class="indent" >   Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech and the inability to listen to
others, I am committed to cultivate loving speech and deep listening in order to bring
joy and happiness to others and relieve others of their suffering. Knowing that words
can create happiness or suffering, I am committed to learn to speak truthfully, with
words that inspire self-confidence, joy, and hope. I am determined not to
spread news that I do not know to be certain and not to criticise or condemn
things of which I am not sure. I will refrain from uttering words that can
cause division or discord, or that can cause the family or the community to
break. I will make all efforts to reconcile and resolve all conflicts, however
small.
<!--l. 71331--><p class="indent" >   -Fifth Training-
<!--l. 71333--><p class="indent" >   Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful consumption, I am committed to
cultivate good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my family, and my
society by practising mindful eating, drinking, and consuming. I am committed to
ingest only items that preserve peace, well-being, and joy in my body, in my
consciousness, and in the collective body and consciousness of my family and society.
I am determined not to use alcohol or any other intoxicant or to ingest foods or other
items that contain toxins, such as certain TV programs, magazines, books, films, and
conversations. I am aware that to damage my body or my consciousness with these

poisons is to betray my ancestors, my parents, my society, and future generations. I
will work to transform violence, fear, anger, and confusion in myself and in
society by practising a diet for myself and for society. I understand that a
proper diet is crucial for self-transformation and for the transformation of
society.

<!--l. 71370--><p class="indent" >   These pages invite you to explore some of the Buddha&#8217;s basic teachings as they
are presented in the Pali canon. Each page in this section contains a selection of short
passages from the suttas (discourses or sermons; see sutta in the Glossary) that
introduce or illustrate different aspects of a single topic. If you encounter a
particularly meaningful or interesting passage you can, in most cases, read the
full text of the sutta from which it came by simply following the link at
the end of that passage. Many of the passages are cross-referenced to other
pages, allowing you to pursue a theme to whatever depth or breadth you
desire.
<!--l. 71381--><p class="indent" >   This is by no means an exhaustive tutorial. A number of the topics introduced
here are explored more thoroughly in the Study Guides. The General Index also has
many references to additional readings on related topics.

method of "gradual instruction" (anupubbi-katha). The Buddha frequently used this
framework to guide his students from first principles through progressively more
advanced teachings, all the way to the fulfillment of the Four Noble Truths and the
realization of Nibbana.
