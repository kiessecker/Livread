<!--l. 61625--><p class="indent" >   Buddhism originated with an Indian prince known as the Buddha, who taught in
Northeast India in the fifth century BC. Two centuries later, with the support of the
Emperor Asoka, Buddhism spread over the greater part of India and from there
traveled the full breadth of the Asian continent. In several tidal waves of
missionary zeal it rose up from its Indian homeland and inundated other regions,
offering the peoples among whom it took root a solid foundation of faith and
wisdom upon which to build their lives and a source of inspiration towards
which to direct their hopes. At different points in history Buddhism has
commanded followings in countries as diverse geographically, ethnically,
and culturally as Afghanistan and Japan, Siberia and Cambodia, Korea
and Sri Lanka; yet all have looked towards the same Indian sage as their
master.
<!--l. 61639--><p class="indent" >   Though for historical reasons Buddhism eventually disappeared from India by
about the twelfth century, before it vanished it had profoundly transformed
Hinduism. In our own time Indian thinkers as different as Swami Vivekananda,
Tagore, Gandhi, and Nehru have looked upon the Buddha as a model. In the
twentieth century, too, while Buddhism has lost much of its following in the East, it
has begun to have a growing impact on an increasing number of people in the West,
and in its own quiet way it is sending down firm roots in several countries of the
Western hemisphere.
<!--l. 61649--><p class="indent" >   In the course of its long history Buddhism has assumed a wide variety of forms.
Because of its peaceful, non-dogmatic character, it has always adapted easily to the
pre-existent cultures and religious practices of the people among whom it
has spread, becoming in turn the fountainhead of a new culture and world
view. So successful has Buddhism been in integrating itself with a country&#8217;s
indigenous culture that it is often difficult for us to discern the common
thread that binds the different forms of Buddhism together as branches
of the same religion. The outer surfaces differ so greatly: from the gentle,
ceremonial Theravada Buddhism of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, to the
contemplative and devotional practices of Far Eastern Mahayana Buddhism, to the
mysterious ritualism of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. Yet, though the outer
faces of these Buddhist schools may differ drastically, they all remain rooted
in a common source, the life and teaching of the man known to us as the
Buddha.
<!--l. 61665--><p class="indent" >   Surprisingly, though the Buddha stands so far back from us in time, further back

than all the later teachers who rose to eminence in the river of Buddhist
history, it is still his voice that speaks to us most directly, in a language we
can immediately understand, in words, images, and ideas to which we can
immediately respond. If we place side by side the texts of the Chandogya
Upanishad and the Buddha&#8217;s Discourse on the Four Noble Truths, which are
separated in time by perhaps only a hundred years, the former seems to come
from a cultural and spiritual milieu so remote we can hardly comprehend it,
while the latter sounds almost as if it had been spoken last week in Bombay,
London, or New York. In attitude and perspective the Buddha comes so close
to us it is hard to believe he is separated from us by a gulf of some 2,500
years.
<!--l. 61679--><p class="indent" >   That the Buddha&#8217;s teaching should remain perennially relevant throughout the
changing eras of human history, that his message should be undimmed by the
sheer passage of time, is already implicit in the title by which he is most
commonly known. For the word "Buddha," as is widely known, is not a proper
name but an honorific title meaning "the Enlightened One," "the Awakened
One." This title is given to him because he has woken up from the deep
sleep of ignorance in which the rest of the world is absorbed; because he has
penetrated the deepest truths about the human condition; and because he
proclaims those truths with the aim of awakening others and enabling them to
share his realization. Despite the shifting scenarios of history over twenty-five
centuries, despite the change in world views and modes of thought from one
epoch to the next, the basic truths of human life do not change. They remain
constant, and are recognizable to those mature enough to reflect on them and
intelligent enough to understand them. For this reason, even today in our age
of jet travel, computer technology, and genetic engineering, it is perfectly
fitting that the One who has Awakened should speak to us in words that
are just as powerful, just as cogent, just as illuminating as they were when
they were first proclaimed long ago in the towns and villages of Northeast
India.
<!--l. 61701--><p class="indent" >   1. The Life of the Buddha
<!--l. 61703--><p class="indent" >   Although we cannot determine with absolute precision the dates of the
Buddha&#8217;s life, many scholars agree that he lived from approximately 563 to
483 BC; a growing number of scholars follow a different chronology which
places the dates about eighty years later. As is natural with a spiritual leader
who has made such a powerful impact on human civilization, the account of
his life that has come down to us has been embroidered with myth and
legend, which serve to bring before the mind&#8217;s eye the loftiness of his spiritual
stature. Nevertheless, in the oldest source on the Buddha&#8217;s life, the Sutta
Pitaka of the Pali Canon, we find a number of texts from which we can
construct a fairly realistic picture of his career. What is striking about the
picture given by these texts is that it shows the Buddha&#8217;s life as a series of
lessons which embody and convey the essential points of his teaching. Thus, in
his own life, the person and the message merge together in an indissoluble
union.
<!--l. 61719--><p class="indent" >   The future master was born into the Sakyan clan in a small republic nestled in

the Himalayan foothills, in a region which at present lies in southern Nepal. His given
name was Siddhattha (Skt: Siddhartha) and his family name Gotama (Gautama).
Legend holds that he was the son of a powerful monarch, but in actuality the Sakyan
state was an oligarchic republic, so his father was probably the chief of the ruling
council of elders. By the Buddha&#8217;s time the Sakyan state had become a tributary of
the powerful state of Kosala, which corresponds to present-day Uttar Pradesh. Even
the oldest suttas tell us that the infant&#8217;s birth was attended by various wonders.
Soon afterwards, a sage named Asita came to visit the baby, and recognizing
on his body the marks of future greatness, he bowed down to the child in
homage.
<!--l. 61732--><p class="indent" >   As a royal youth, Prince Siddhattha was raised in luxury. His father had built for
him three palaces, one for each season of the year, and there he enjoyed himself in the
company of his friends. At the age of sixteen he married his cousin, a beautiful
princess named Yasodhara, and lived a contented life in the Sakyan capital,
Kapilavatthu; during this time he was probably trained in the martial arts and the
skills of statecraft.
<!--l. 61740--><p class="indent" >   As the years passed, however, when he reached his late twenties, the prince
became increasingly introspective. What troubled him were the great burning
issues we ordinarily take for granted &#8212; the questions concerning the purpose
and meaning of our lives. Is the purpose of our existence the enjoyment of
sensual pleasures, the achievement of wealth and status, the exercise of power?
Or is there something beyond these, more real and fulfilling? These must
have been the questions that rippled across his mind, for we find his own
reflections recorded for us in a discourse called "The Noble Quest" (MN
26):
<!--l. 61751--><p class="indent" >   Monks, before my enlightenment, being myself subject to birth, aging, sickness
and death, to sorrow and defilement, I sought what was subject to birth, aging,
sickness and death, to sorrow and defilement.
<!--l. 61755--><p class="indent" >   Then I considered thus: "Why, being subject to birth... to defilement, should I
seek what is subject to birth... and defilement? Suppose that, being myself subject to
birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn,
the supreme security from bondage, Nibbana. Suppose that, being myself subject to
aging, sickness and death, to sorrow and defilement, I seek the unaging, unailing,
deathless, sorrowless and undefiled state, the supreme security from bondage,
Nibbana."
<!--l. 61764--><p class="indent" >   Thus, at the age of 29, in the prime of life, with his parents weeping, he cut off his
hair and beard, put on the saffron robes of a mendicant, and entered upon the
homeless life of renunciation. The developed Buddha biography adds that he left the
palace on the very day that his wife gave birth to their only child, the boy
Rahula.
<!--l. 61770--><p class="indent" >   Having left behind his home and family, the Bodhisatta or "seeker of
enlightenment" (as he is now called) headed south for Magadha (present-day Bihar),
in whose environs small groups of seekers were quietly pursuing their quest for
spiritual illumination, usually under the guidance of a guru. At the time northern
India could boast of a number of accomplished masters famous for their philosophical
systems and achievements in meditation. Prince Siddhattha sought out two of the

most eminent, Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. From them he learned systems
of meditation which, from the descriptions in the texts, seem to have been
forerunners of Raja Yoga. The Bodhisatta mastered their teachings and systems of
meditation, but though he reached exalted levels of concentration (samadhi), he
found these teachings insufficient, for they did not lead to the goal he was seeking:
perfect enlightenment and the realization of Nibbana, release from the sufferings of
sentient existence.
<!--l. 61786--><p class="indent" >   Having left his teachers, the Bodhisatta adopted a different path, one
that was popular in ancient India and still has followers today: the path of
asceticism, of self-mortification, pursued in the conviction that liberation
is to be won by afflicting the body with pain beyond its normal levels of
endurance. For six years the Bodhisatta followed this method with unyielding
determination. He fasted for days on end until his body looked like a skeleton cloaked
in skin; he exposed himself to the heat of the midday sun and the cold of
the night; he subjected his flesh to such torments that he came almost to
the door of death. Yet he found that despite his persistence and sincerity
these austerities were futile. Later he would say that he took the path of
self-mortification further than all other ascetics, yet it led, not to higher wisdom and
enlightenment, but only to physical weakness and the deterioration of his mental
faculties.
<!--l. 61801--><p class="indent" >   Just then he thought of another path to enlightenment, one which balanced
proper care of the body with sustained contemplation and deep investigation. He
would later call this path "the middle way" because it avoids the extremes of sensual
indulgence and self-mortification. He had experienced both extremes, the former as a
prince and the latter as an ascetic, and he knew they were ultimately dead ends. To
follow the middle way, however, he realized he would first have to regain his strength.
Thus he gave up his practice of austerities and resumed taking nutritious food. At
the time five other ascetics had been living in attendance on the Bodhisatta, hoping
that when he attained enlightenment he would serve as their guide. But when they
saw him partake of substantial meals, they became disgusted with him and left him,
thinking the princely ascetic had given up his exertion and reverted to a life of
luxury.
<!--l. 61815--><p class="indent" >   Now he was alone, and complete solitude allowed him to pursue his quest
undisturbed. One day, when his physical strength had returned, he approached a
lovely spot in Uruvela by the bank of the Nerañjara River. Here he prepared a
seat of straw beneath an asvattha tree (later called the Bodhi Tree) and sat
down cross-legged, making a firm resolution that he would never rise up
from that seat until he had won his goal. As night descended he entered
into deeper and deeper stages of meditation until his mind was perfectly
calm and composed. Then, the records tell us, in the first watch of the night
he directed his concentrated mind to the recollection of his previous lives.
Gradually there unfolded before his inner vision his experiences in many past
births, even during many cosmic aeons; in the middle watch of the night
he developed the "divine eye" by which he could see beings passing away
and taking rebirth in accordance with their karma, their deeds; and in the
last watch of the night he penetrated the deepest truths of existence, the

most basic laws of reality, and thereby removed from his mind the subtlest
veils of ignorance. When dawn broke, the figure sitting beneath the tree
was no longer a Bodhisatta, a seeker of enlightenment, but a Buddha, a
Perfectly Enlightened One, one who had attained the Deathless in this very life
itself.
<!--l. 61836--><p class="indent" >   For several weeks the newly awakened Buddha remained in the vicinity of the
Bodhi Tree contemplating from different angles the Dhamma, the truth he had
discovered. Then he came to a new crossroad in his spiritual career: Was he to teach,
to try to share his realization with others, or should he instead remain quietly in the
forest, enjoying the bliss of liberation alone?
<!--l. 61843--><p class="indent" >   At first his mind inclined to keeping quiet; for he thought the truth he had
realized was just too deep for others to understand, too difficult to express in
words, and he was concerned he would just weary himself trying to convey his
realization to others. But now the texts introduce a dramatic element into
the story. Just at the moment the Buddha decided to remain silent, a high
deity named Brahma Sahampati, the Lord of a Thousand Worlds, realized
that if the Master remained silent the world would be lost, deprived of the
stainless path to deliverance from suffering. Therefore he descended to earth,
bowed down low before the Enlightened One, and humbly pleaded with
him to teach the Dhamma "for the sake of those with little dust in their
eyes."
<!--l. 61855--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha then gazed out upon the world with his profound vision. He saw that
people are like lotuses in a pond at different stages of growth, and he understood that
just as some lotuses close to the surface of the water need only the sun&#8217;s rays to rise
above the surface and fully blossom, so there are some people who need only to hear
the noble teaching to win enlightenment and gain perfect liberation of mind. When
he saw this his heart was stirred by deep compassion, and he decided to go
back into the world and to teach the Dhamma to those who were ready to
listen.
<!--l. 61865--><p class="indent" >   The first ones he approached were his former companions, the five ascetics who
had deserted him a few months earlier and were now dwelling in a deer park at
Sarnath near Benares. He explained to them the truths he had discovered, and on
hearing his discourse they gained insight into the Dhamma, becoming his
first disciples. In the months ahead his following grew by leaps and bounds
as both householders and ascetics heard the liberating message, gave up
their former creeds, and declared themselves disciples of the Enlightened
One.
<!--l. 61874--><p class="indent" >   Each year, even into his old age, he would wander among the villages, towns, and
cities of the Ganges plain, teaching all who would lend an ear; he would rest only for
the three months of the rainy season, and then resume his wanderings, which took
him from present Delhi even as far east as Bengal. He established a Sangha, an
order of monks and nuns, for which he laid down an intricate body of rules
and regulations; this order still remains alive today, perhaps (along with
the Jain order) the world&#8217;s oldest continuous institution. He also attracted
many lay followers who became devoted supporters of the Master and his
Sangha.

<!--l. 61885--><p class="indent" >   After an active ministry of forty-five years, at the ripe age of eighty, the Buddha
headed for the northern town of Kusinara. There, surrounded by many disciples, he
passed away into the "Nibbana element with no remainder of conditioned existence,"
severing forever his bondage to the round of rebirths.
<!--l. 61891--><p class="indent" >   I said earlier that each of the major events in the Buddha&#8217;s life gives us a specific
object lesson in his teaching. Now I want to draw out the lessons suggested by these
events.
<!--l. 61895--><p class="indent" >   First, the Bodhisatta&#8217;s awakening to the harsh realities of human existence &#8212; his
discovery of our bondage to old age, illness, and death &#8212; teaches us the importance
of deep reflection and critical thinking. His awakening reflects back to us the
somnambulance in which we usually live, mired in our pleasures and petty concerns,
oblivious to the "great affair" staring us in the face at every moment of our
lives. His awakening reminds us that we ourselves must emerge from the
comfortable but dangerous cocoon of ignorance in which we have settled down;
that we must break away from our thoughtless infatuation with our youth,
health, and vitality; that we must rise to a new level of mature understanding
which will enable us to triumph in our inevitable encounter with the Lord of
Death.
<!--l. 61909--><p class="indent" >   The Bodhisatta&#8217;s departure from the palace, his "great renunciation," teaches us
a lesson in values. It shows us that from among the wide range of values which we
can draw upon to give order to our lives, the quest for enlightenment and liberation
should reign supreme. This goal ranks far above the pleasure, wealth, and power to
which we ordinarily give priority, even above the call of social duty and mundane
responsibilities. This does not mean, of course, that everyone who wants to follow the
Buddha&#8217;s path must be ready to leave behind home and family and adopt the
lifestyle of a monk or nun. The Buddha&#8217;s community of disciples included many
householders as well as monks, devout laymen and laywomen who attained
high levels of awakening while living active lives within the world. But the
Buddha&#8217;s example does show us that we must all order our values according
to a scale which gives the highest place to the most worthy goal, to that
which is also the most real of all realities, Nibbana; and we should never
allow the claims of mundane obligations to pull us away from pursuing our
aspiration.
<!--l. 61927--><p class="indent" >   Next, the Bodhisatta&#8217;s six years of struggle shows us that the quest for the
highest goal is a strenuous undertaking that calls for deep dedication and unrelenting
effort. Fortunately for us, the Bodhisatta found that the practice of self-mortification
is a fruitless exercise, and thus we need not follow him in this direction. But his
uncompromising pursuit of truth underscores the degree of effort that the
quest for enlightenment requires, and those who seek such a goal in full
earnestness must be ready to submit to a difficult and demanding course of
training.
<!--l. 61936--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha&#8217;s enlightenment teaches us that ultimate wisdom and deliverance
from suffering is a real potential inherent in human beings, one we can realize for
ourselves without the aid or grace of an external savior. His enlightenment also
highlights the ideal of sensible moderation, "the middle way," which has
characterized Buddhism throughout its long history. The quest for truth may be a

difficult undertaking, one which makes harsh demands on us, but it does not ask us
to subject ourselves to penance and self-punishment. Final victory is to be won, not
by tormenting the body, but by developing the mind, and this takes place through a
course of training that balances care for the body with the cultivation of our higher
spiritual faculties.
<!--l. 61948--><p class="indent" >   The decision the Buddha made after his enlightenment brings home another
lesson to us. At this critical juncture, when he was faced with the choice of either
keeping his enlightenment to himself or taking up the challenge of teaching others,
the mandate of compassion prevailed in his heart. Leaving behind the quietude of the
forest, he took upon himself the burden of guiding errant humanity along the path to
liberation. This choice has had a tremendous impact on the subsequent development
of Buddhism, for throughout its long history the spirit of compassion has
been the heartbeat of the Buddha&#8217;s dispensation, its innermost animating
spirit. It was the Buddha&#8217;s compassionate example that motivated Buddhist
monks and nuns to travel across seas, mountains, and deserts, at the risk
of their lives, to share the blessings of the Dhamma with those still lost
in darkness. It is this example that inspires many Buddhists today, in a
wide variety of ways, even when they can express their compassion only in
humble acts of kindness and tender concern for those less fortunate than
themselves.
<!--l. 61965--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the Buddha&#8217;s passing away, his attainment of final Nibbana, teaches us
once again that everything conditioned must perish, that all formations are
impermanent, that even the greatest of spiritual masters is no exception to the very
law he so often proclaimed. His passing away also teaches us that the highest bliss
and peace comes only by relinquishing all, through the stilling of all conditioned
things. For this is the final entrance way to the attainment of the unconditioned, the
Deathless, Nibbana.
<!--l. 61974--><p class="indent" >   2. The Buddha&#8217;s Mission
<!--l. 61976--><p class="indent" >   To ask why the Buddha&#8217;s teaching proved so attractive and gained such a large
following among all sectors of Northeast Indian society is to raise a question which is
also relevant to us today. For we live at a time when Buddhism is exerting a strong
appeal upon an increasing number of people, especially among those whose level
of education and capacity for reflection has made them indifferent to the
claims of revealed religion. I believe the remarkable success of Buddhism, as
well as its contemporary appeal, can be understood principally in terms of
two factors: one, the aim of the teaching; and the other, its methodological
features.
<!--l. 61987--><p class="indent" >   (i) The Aim of the Teaching
<!--l. 61989--><p class="indent" >   Unlike the so-called revealed religions, which rest upon faith in unverifiable
doctrines, the Buddha formulated his teaching in a way that directly addresses the
critical problem at the heart of human existence &#8212; the problem of suffering &#8212; and
he promises that those who follow his teaching to its end will realize here and now
the highest happiness and peace. All other concerns apart from this, such as
theological dogmas, metaphysical subtleties, rituals and rules of worship, the Buddha
waves aside as irrelevant to the task at hand, the unraveling of the problem of
suffering.

<!--l. 61999--><p class="indent" >   This pragmatic thrust of the Dhamma is clearly illustrated by an incident related
in the texts. Once a monk named Malunkyaputta was pondering the great
metaphysical questions &#8212; whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, infinite or
finite, etc. &#8212; and he felt unhappy because the Buddha had refused to answer them.
So one day Malunkyaputta went to the Master and told him, "Either you answer
these questions for me or I leave the order."
<!--l. 62007--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha then told Malunkyaputta that the spiritual life did not depend on
any answers to these questions, which were mere distractions from the real challenge
of following the path. He then compared the metaphysician to a man struck by a
poisoned arrow. When his relatives bring a surgeon, the man tells him, "
I won&#8217;t let you remove the arrow until you let me know the name of the
man who struck me, the type of bow he used, the material from which the
arrow was made, and the kind of poison he used." That man would die, the
Buddha said, before the arrow was removed, and so too the metaphysician,
struck with the arrow of suffering, will die without ever finding the path to
freedom.
<!--l. 62019--><p class="indent" >   Not only does the Buddha make suffering and release from suffering
the focus of his teaching, but he deals with the problem of suffering in a
way that reveals an extraordinary degree of psychological insight. Like a
psychoanalyst, the Buddha traces suffering to its roots within our minds, to
our craving and clinging, and he holds that the cure, the solution to the
problem of suffering, must also be achieved within our minds. To gain freedom
from suffering it is futile to pray to the gods, to worship holy objects, to
attach ourselves to rituals and ceremonies. Since suffering arises from our
own mental defilements, we have to purify our minds of these defilements,
from our greed, hatred, and ignorance, and this requires profound inner
honesty.
<!--l. 62031--><p class="indent" >   While other religions lead us outward &#8212; towards ideas of a deity who determines
our fate, or to lofty philosophical abstractions like the idea of a universal self or a
nondual reality in which all opposites are resolved &#8212; the Buddha leads us back to
ourselves, always keeping his teaching attuned to the hard facts of experience. He
places the mind at the forefront of his analysis and says that it is the mind which
fashions our actions, the mind which shapes our destiny, the mind which leads us
towards misery or happiness. The beginning point of the teaching is the
ordinary mind, in bondage and subject to suffering; the end point is the
enlightened mind, completely purified and liberated from suffering. The
whole teaching unfolds between these two points, taking the most direct
route.
<!--l. 62044--><p class="indent" >   (ii) Characteristic Features of the Teaching
<!--l. 62046--><p class="indent" >   1. Self-reliance. This discussion of the aim of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching leads us to
the teaching&#8217;s characteristic features. One of its most attractive features, closely
related to its psychological orientation, is its emphasis on self-reliance. For the
Buddha, the key to liberation is mental purity and correct understanding, and for
this reason he rejects the notion that we can gain salvation by leaning on any
external authority. He says: "By oneself is evil done, by oneself is one defiled. By
oneself is evil left undone, by oneself is one purified. Purity and defilement depend on

oneself; no one can purify another" (Dhp 165).
<!--l. 62057--><p class="indent" >   This stress on human effort, on our capacity to liberate ourselves, is a distinctive
feature of early Buddhism and offers a remarkable affirmation of the human
potential. The Buddha does not claim any divine status for himself, nor does he
assert that he is an agent of human salvation. He claims to be, not a personal
savior, but a guide and teacher: "You yourselves must strive, the Buddha only
points the way. Those who meditate and practice the path are freed from the
bonds of death" (Dhp 276). Throughout his ministry he urged his disciples to
"be islands to yourselves, be refuges to yourselves, without looking to any
external refuge." Even on his deathbed he gave his followers this last piece of
advice: "All conditioned things are subject to decay. Attain the goal by
diligence."
<!--l. 62071--><p class="indent" >   2. Experiential Emphasis. Since wisdom or insight is the chief instrument of
enlightenment, the Buddha always asked his disciples to follow him on the basis of
their own understanding, not from obedience or unquestioning trust. He
calls his Dhamma ehipassiko, which means "Come and see for yourself." He
invites inquirers to investigate his teaching, to examine it in the light of
their own reason and intelligence, and to gain confirmation of its truth for
themselves. The Dhamma is said to be paccattam veditabbo viññuhi, "to be
personally understood by the wise," and this requires intelligence and sustained
inquiry.
<!--l. 62082--><p class="indent" >   Once the Buddha arrived at the town of a people called the Kalamas,
who had been visited by many other ascetics. Each visiting teacher would
praise his own doctrine to the sky and tear down the views of his rivals, and
this left the Kalamas utterly confused. So when the Buddha arrived they
came to him, explained their dilemma, and asked if he could offer some
guidance.
<!--l. 62089--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha did not praise his own teaching and attack his rivals. Rather, he told
them:
<!--l. 62092--><p class="indent" >   It is right for you to doubt; doubt has arisen in you about dubious matters.
Come, Kalamas, do not rely on oral tradition, or on the lineage of teachers, or on
holy scriptures, or on abstract logic. Do not place blind trust in impressive
personalities or in venerated gurus, but examine the issue for yourselves. When you
know for yourselves that something is unwholesome and harmful, then you should
reject it. And when you know for yourselves that something is wholesome and
beneficial, then you should accept it and put it into practice.
<!--l. 62101--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; AN 3.65
<!--l. 62103--><p class="indent" >   3. Universality. Because the Buddha&#8217;s teaching deals with the most universal of
all human problems, the problem of suffering, he made his teaching a universal
message, one which was addressed to all human beings solely by reason of their
humanity. At the time the Buddha appeared on the Indian scene the higher religious
teachings, recorded in the Vedas, were reserved for the brahmans, a privileged elite
who performed sacrifices and rituals for others. Ordinary people were told to perform
their duties in a spirit of humility in the hope that they might win a more
fortunate rebirth and thus gain access to the sacred teachings. But the Buddha
placed no restrictions on the people to whom he taught the Dhamma. He held

that what made a person noble was his personal character and conduct,
not his family and caste status. Thus he opened the doors of liberation to
people of all social classes. Brahmans, kings and princes, merchants, farmers,
workers, even outcasts &#8212; all were welcome to hear the Dhamma without
discrimination, and many from the lower classes attained the highest stage of
enlightenment.
<!--l. 62120--><p class="indent" >   Within the wider Indian society the Buddha did not attempt to abolish the caste
system, which, it seems, had not yet developed into the complex, oppressive system it
became several centuries later. However, he flatly rejected the orthodox brahman
view that a person&#8217;s class status was an indication of his intrinsic worth. Within the
Sangha, the monastic order, he completely disregarded all distinctions of social class,
declaring,
<!--l. 62128--><p class="indent" >   Just as the waters of the four great rivers flow into the ocean and become known
simply as the water of the ocean, so when people of all four social classes go forth as
monks in my teaching, they give up their social status and become known simply as
disciples of the Buddha.
<!--l. 62133--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Ud 5.5
<!--l. 62135--><p class="indent" >   As part of his universalist project, the Buddha also threw open the doors of his
teaching to women. Among the followers of Brahmanism, sacred teachings were the
province of men. Women were to perform their domestic chores dutifully, to care for
their husbands and in-laws, and to bear children, preferably sons. They were
excluded from performing the Vedic rituals and even the teachings of the Upanishads
were, with rare exceptions, the prerogative of men. The Buddha, in contrast, taught
the Dhamma freely to both men and women. At first he hesitated to establish
an order of nuns, since this would have been a radical step in his age; but
once he agreed to create the order of nuns, women from all walks of life
&#8212; princesses, housewives, daughters of good family, servant women, even
former prostitutes &#8212; went forth into homelessness and attained the highest
goal.
<!--l. 62149--><p class="indent" >   4. A Code of Ethics. One aspect of the Buddha&#8217;s universalism deserves special
mention: this is his conception of a universal code of ethics. It would be too extreme
to say that the Buddha was the first religious teacher to formulate a moral code,
for moral codes of different kinds had been laid down from the dawn of
civilization. But it might not be farfetched to say that the Buddha was one of the
very first teachers to separate out true moral principles from the complex
fabric of social norms and communal customs with which they were generally
interwoven.
<!--l. 62158--><p class="indent" >   With astute sophistication of thought, the Buddha provides for us an
abstract principle to use as a guideline in determining the basic precepts of
morality. This is the rule of "using oneself as a standard" (attanam upamam
katva) for deciding how to treat others. From this abstract principle, he
derives the four main precepts of his moral code: to abstain from killing, from
stealing, from sexual misconduct, and from lying. In the interest of personal
welfare and communal harmony he adds a fifth: to abstain from intoxicants.
Together, these give us the Five Precepts (pañcasila), the basic moral code of
Buddhism.

<!--l. 62169--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha, however, did not regard morality merely as a set of rules based on
reasoning. He taught that there is a universal law which connects our conduct with
our personal destinies, ensuring that moral justice ultimately prevails in the world.
This is the law of karma and its fruit, which holds that our intentional actions
determine the type of rebirth we take and the diverse experiences we undergo in the
course of our lives. This law is utterly impersonal in its operation. It gives no one
preferential treatment; it recognizes no VIPs or favorites, but works with absolute
uniformity towards all. Those who violate the laws of morality &#8212; whether they be
high class or low class, rich or poor &#8212; acquire unwholesome karma and must suffer
the consequences: a bad rebirth and future misery. Those who adhere to the moral
rules, who engage in virtuous conduct, acquire wholesome karma leading to
future benefits: a good rebirth, a happy life, and progress on the way to final
liberation.
<!--l. 62185--><p class="indent" >   In conformity with the psychological orientation of his teaching, the Buddha gave
special attention to the subjective springs of morality. He traces immoral behavior to
three mental factors called the "three unwholesome roots" &#8212; greed, hatred, and
delusion; and he traces ethical behavior to their opposites, the three wholesome roots
&#8212; non-greed or generosity, non-hate or kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom. He
also directs us to a more refined interior level of ethical purity to be achieved by
developing, in meditation, four lofty attitudes called the "divine abodes"
(brahma-vihara). These are loving-kindness (metta), the wish for the happiness and
welfare of all beings; compassion (karuna), the wish that all afflicted with suffering be
freed from their suffering; altruistic joy (mudita), rejoicing in the happiness and
success of others; and equanimity (upekkha), impartiality of mind. These four
attitudes are to be developed universally, towards all beings without distinctions or
discrimination.
<!--l. 62202--><p class="indent" >   Before I close there is one further feature of the Buddha&#8217;s method that I
want to mention. This is what might be called his "skill in means." Through
his deep meditative attainments and his enlightened wisdom, the Buddha
had the special ability to discover the precise way to teach the people who
came to him for guidance. He could read deep into the hidden recesses of a
person&#8217;s heart, perceive that person&#8217;s aptitudes and interests, and frame his
teaching in the exact way needed to transform that person and lead him or
her on to the path of freedom. The texts abound in many examples of this
supreme pedagogic skill of the Buddha. Here I will relate just two famous
instances.
<!--l. 62214--><p class="indent" >   The first is the case of Angulimala, a serial killer who lived in the forests of
Kosala outside the capital Savatthi. Angulimala repeatedly attacked travelers, killed
them, and cut off their fingers, which he wove into a necklace that he wore around his
neck. He had killed hundreds of people and was feared throughout the kingdom. He
was "wanted dead or alive," but no one had the courage to pursue him. The Buddha
saw, however, with his supernormal vision, that Angulimala had another side to his
character: as terrible as he was, he had the hidden potential to become an arahant, a
saint. Thus one day, all alone, he headed out for the forest where Angulimala was
dwelling.
<!--l. 62225--><p class="indent" >   When Angulimala saw him he thought, "Ah, now I will kill this ascetic and cut

off his finger for my necklace." He started to run after him with his knife poised in
the air. But no matter how fast he ran he could not reach him. For the
Buddha, while walking along slowly, had performed a feat of psychic power such
that Angulimala, running with all his might, could not catch up with him.
Angulimala ran and ran but could not gain an inch. He then called out, "Stop,
ascetic, stop!" The Buddha replied, "I have stopped, Angulimala, you stop
too."
<!--l. 62236--><p class="indent" >   This statement had a deep impact on the criminal, an impact which struck down
to the depths of his heart. He realized that the ascetic before him was the famous
teacher, the Enlightened One, and he knew the Buddha had come to him out of
compassion, to save him from his terrible deeds. He threw away his knife, bowed
down at the Master&#8217;s feet, and asked to be accepted as a monk. The Buddha
admitted him into the order and after a short time Angulimala became an arahant,
perfectly wise and deeply compassionate.
<!--l. 62245--><p class="indent" >   The second story concerns the woman Kisagotami. She was a poor woman
who had married into a wealthy family, but she did not bear children and
was thus scorned by her in-laws. This made her very miserable. But after
some time she conceived and gave birth to a son, who became for her the
source of boundless joy. Now that she had brought forth an heir to their
wealth, everyone else in her husband&#8217;s family too accepted her. But a few
months after his birth the child died, and Kisagotami became distraught. She
refused to believe the boy was dead, but convinced herself he was only ill.
Thus she went around everywhere asking people to give her medicine for her
son.
<!--l. 62256--><p class="indent" >   The townsfolk ridiculed her and abused her, calling her a mad woman, until she
finally came into the presence of the Buddha. When she asked him for medicine, he
did not give her an eloquent sermon on impermanence. He told her that he could
indeed make some medicine for her son, but first she would have to bring him
one ingredient: mustard seeds from a home where no one had ever died.
Quite optimistic, she went from house to house, asking for mustard seeds.
At each door people readily gave her seeds, but when she asked the donor
whether anyone in that home had ever died, she was told, "Here a father has
died, here a mother, here a wife, here a husband, a brother, a sister," and so
on.
<!--l. 62268--><p class="indent" >   She thus came to see that death is the universal fate of all living beings, not a
unique calamity that befell her own son. So she returned to the Buddha, aware now
of the universal law of impermanence. When the Master saw her coming he asked
her, "Did you bring the mustard seeds, Gotami?" And she replied: "Done, sir, is this
business of the mustard seeds. Grant me a refuge." The Buddha had her
ordained as a nun, and after some time she realized the highest goal and
became one of the most eminent nuns in the Bhikkhuni Sangha or Order of
Nuns.
<!--l. 62278--><p class="indent" >   To sum up, the Buddha&#8217;s mission was to establish a path to spiritual perfection,
to full enlightenment and Nibbana, liberation from suffering. He did this by
propounding a teaching that acknowledged our capacity for attaining spiritual
perfection yet which also remained fully respectful of the intelligence and autonomy

of human beings. His approach was psychological in orientation, non-dogmatic,
pragmatic, and open to investigation. He emphasized self-effort, moral rectitude, and
personal responsibility, and he proclaimed his message universally, holding that the
potential for spiritual growth and even for the highest enlightenment was
accessible to anyone who makes the appropriate effort. It is these factors that
give to the ancient teaching of the Buddha such a distinctly modern flavor,
making it so relevant to us in these times of shifting ideas and changing
values.
