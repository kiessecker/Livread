<!--l. 71080--><p class="indent" >   The Digha Nikaya, or "Collection of Long Discourses" (Pali digha = "long") is
the first division of the Sutta Pitaka, and consists of thirty-four suttas, grouped into
three vaggas, or divisions:
<!--l. 71085--><p class="indent" >   Silakkhandha-vagga &#8212; The Division Concerning Morality (13 suttas)
<!--l. 71088--><p class="indent" >   Maha-vagga &#8212; The Large Division (10 suttas)
<!--l. 71090--><p class="indent" >   Patika-vagga &#8212; The Patika Division (11 suttas)
<!--l. 71092--><p class="indent" >   An excellent modern translation of the complete Digha Nikaya is Maurice
Walshe&#8217;s The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya
(formerly titled: Thus Have I Heard) (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 1987). A fine
anthology of selected suttas is Handful of Leaves (Vol. 1), by Thanissaro Bhikkhu
(distributed by the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies).
<!--l. 71099--><p class="indent" >   The translator appears in the [square brackets]. The {braces} contain the volume
and starting page number in the PTS romanized Pali edition.
<!--l. 71103--><p class="indent" >   DN 2: Samaññaphala Sutta &#8212; The Fruits of the Contemplative Life {D i 47}
[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71106--><p class="indent" >   King Ajatasattu asks the Buddha, "What are the fruits of the contemplative life,
visible in the here and now?" The Buddha replies by painting a comprehensive
portrait of the Buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with
vivid similes.
<!--l. 71112--><p class="indent" >   DN 9: Potthapada Sutta &#8212; About Potthapada {D i 178} [Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71115--><p class="indent" >   The wandering ascetic Potthapada brings to the Buddha a tangle of questions
concerning the nature of perception. The Buddha clears up the matter by reviewing
the fundamentals of concentration meditation and showing how it can lead to the
ultimate cessation of perception.
<!--l. 71120--><p class="indent" >   DN 11: Kevatta (Kevaddha) Sutta &#8212; To Kevatta (Kevaddha) {D i 211}
[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71123--><p class="indent" >   This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly
beings as a possible basis for faith and belief. The Buddha does not deny the reality
of such experiences, but he points out that &#8212; of all possible miracles &#8212; the only
reliable one is the miracle of instruction in the proper training of the mind. As for
heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the
information they give &#8212; especially with regard to the miracle of instruction
&#8212; is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the
instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one&#8217;s own mental
defilements. The tale that concludes the discourse is one of the finest examples of
the early Buddhist sense of humor. [This summary provided by Thanissaro

Bhikkhu]
<!--l. 71137--><p class="indent" >   DN 12: Lohicca Sutta &#8212; To Lohicca {D i 224} [Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71139--><p class="indent" >   A non-Buddhist poses some good questions: If Dhamma is something that one
must realize for oneself, then what is the role of a teacher? Are there any teachers
who don&#8217;t deserve some sort of criticism? The Buddha&#8217;s reply includes a sweeping
summary of the entire path of practice.
<!--l. 71144--><p class="indent" >   DN 15: Maha-nidana Sutta &#8212; The Great Causes Discourse {D ii 55}
[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71147--><p class="indent" >   One of the most profound discourses in the Pali canon, which gives an extended
treatment of the teachings of dependent co-arising (paticca samuppada) and not-self
(anatta) in an outlined context of how these teachings function in practice. An
explanatory preface is included.
<!--l. 71152--><p class="indent" >   DN 16: Maha-parinibbana Sutta &#8212; The Last Days of the Buddha {D ii 72}
[Vajira/Story (complete text) | Thanissaro (chapters 5-6)].
<!--l. 71156--><p class="indent" >   This wide-ranging sutta, the longest one in the Pali canon, describes the events
leading up to, during, and immediately following the death and final release
(parinibbana) of the Buddha. This colorful narrative contains a wealth of Dhamma
teachings, including the Buddha&#8217;s final instructions that defined how Buddhism
would be lived and practiced long after the Buddha&#8217;s death &#8212; even to this day. But
this sutta also depicts, in simple language, the poignant human drama that unfolds
among the Buddha&#8217;s many devoted followers around the time of the death of their
beloved teacher.
<!--l. 71166--><p class="indent" >   DN 20: Maha-samaya Sutta &#8212; The Great Meeting {D ii 253} [Piyadassi |
Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71169--><p class="indent" >   A large group of devas pays a visit to the Buddha. This sutta is the closest thing
in the Pali canon to a "who&#8217;s who" of the deva worlds, providing useful material for
anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism.
<!--l. 71174--><p class="indent" >   DN 21: Sakka-pañha Sutta &#8212; Sakka&#8217;s Questions (excerpt) {D ii 263}
[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71177--><p class="indent" >   Sakka, the deva-king, asks the Buddha about the sources of conflict, and
about the path of practice that can bring it to an end. This discourse ends
with a humorous account about Sakka&#8217;s frustration in trying to learn the
Dhamma from other contemplatives. It&#8217;s hard to find a teacher when you&#8217;re a
king.
<!--l. 71183--><p class="indent" >   DN 22: Maha-satipatthana Sutta &#8212; The Great Frames of Reference (The Great
Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness) {D ii 290} [Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71187--><p class="indent" >   This sutta offers comprehensive practical instructions on the development of
mindfulness in meditation. The Buddha describes how the development of continuous
mindfulness of the four satipatthana ("foundations of mindfulness" or "frames of
reference") &#8212; mindfulness of the body, of feelings, of the mind, and of mind-objects
&#8212; can lead ultimately to full Awakening. [The text of this sutta is identical to that of
the Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10), except that the Majjhima version omits the
exposition of the Four Noble Truths (sections 5a,b,c and d in part D of this
version).]
<!--l. 71198--><p class="indent" >   DN 26: Cakkavatti Sutta &#8212; The Wheel-turning Emperor (excerpt) {D iii 58}
[Thanissaro].

<!--l. 71201--><p class="indent" >   In this excerpt the Buddha explains how skillful action can result in the best kind
of long life, the best kind of beauty, the best kind of happiness, and the best kind of
strength.
<!--l. 71205--><p class="indent" >   DN 31: Sigalovada Sutta &#8212; To Sigala/The Layperson&#8217;s Code of Discipline {D iii
180} [Narada | Kelly/Sawyer/Yareham].
<!--l. 71208--><p class="indent" >   The householder&#8217;s code of discipline, as described by the Buddha to the layman
Sigala. This sutta offers valuable practical advice for householders on how to conduct
themselves skillfully in their relationships with parents, spouses, children, pupils,
teachers, employers, employees, friends, and spiritual mentors so as to bring
happiness to all concerned.
<!--l. 71214--><p class="indent" >   DN 32: Atanatiya Sutta &#8212; The Discourse on Atanatiya {D iii 194} [Piyadassi].
<!--l. 71217--><p class="indent" >   One of the "protective verses" (paritta) that are chanted to this day for
ceremonial purposes by Theravada monks and nuns around the world. See
Piyadassi Thera&#8217;s The Book of Protection (Kandy: Buddhist Publication Society,
1999).
