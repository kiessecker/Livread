Exeter College, Oxford. In 1948 he came to Sri Lanka, where he was ordained
the following year at the Island Hermitage near Dodanduwa. During his
11 years in the Sangha Ven. 혀namoli translated into lucid English some
of the most difficult texts of Theravada Buddhism. In 1960, on one of his
rare outings from the Hermitage, he suddenly passed away due to heart
failure.

<!--l. 57155--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 57157--><p class="indent" >   The Sammaditthi Sutta, the Discourse on Right View, is the ninth sutta of the
Majjhima Nikaya, the Collection of Middle Length Discourses. Its expositor is the
Venerable Sariputta Thera, the Buddha&#8217;s chief disciple and the foremost of the
Master&#8217;s bhikkhu disciples in the exercise of the faculty of wisdom. The Buddha
declared that next to himself, it was the Venerable Sariputta who excelled in turning
the incomparable Wheel of the Dhamma, in expounding in depth and in detail the
Four Noble Truths realized with the attainment of enlightenment. In the
Sammaditthi Sutta the great disciple bears ample testimony to the Buddha&#8217;s words
of praise, bequeathing upon us a discourse that has served as a primer of Buddhist
doctrine for generations of monks in the monasteries of South and Southeast
Asia.
<!--l. 57170--><p class="indent" >   As its title suggests, the subject of the Sammaditthi Sutta is right view.
The analysis of right view undertaken in the sutta brings us to the very
core of the Dhamma, since right view constitutes the correct understanding
of the central teachings of the Buddha, the teachings which confer upon
the Buddha&#8217;s doctrine its own unique and distinctive stamp. Though the
practice of right mindfulness has rightly been extolled as the crest jewel
of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching, it cannot be stressed strongly enough that the
practice of mindfulness, or any other approach to meditation, only becomes
an effective instrument of liberation to the extent that it is founded upon
and guided by right view. Hence, to confirm the importance of right view,
the Buddha places it at the very beginning of the Noble Eightfold Path.
Elsewhere in the Suttas the Buddha calls right view the forerunner of the path
(pubbangama), which gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path
factors.
<!--l. 57185--><p class="indent" >   Right view, as explained in the commentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta, has a
variety of aspects, but it might best be considered as twofold: conceptual right view,
which is the intellectual grasp of the principles enunciated in the Buddha&#8217;s teaching,
and experiential right view, which is the wisdom that arises by direct penetration of
the teaching. Conceptual right view, also called the right view in conformity with the
truths (saccanulomika-sammaditthi), is a correct conceptual understanding of the
Dhamma arrived at by study of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings and deep examination of
their meaning. Such understanding, though conceptual rather than experiential, is
not dry and sterile. When rooted in faith in the Triple Gem and driven by a keen
aspiration to realize the truth embedded in the formulated principles of
the Dhamma, it serves as a critical phase in the development of wisdom
(pa章a), for it provides the germ out of which experiential right view gradually
evolves.
<!--l. 57200--><p class="indent" >   Experiential right view is the penetration of the truth of the teaching in one&#8217;s own
immediate experience. Thus it is also called right view that penetrates the truths
(saccapativedha-sammaditthi). This type of right view is aroused by the practice of
insight meditation guided by a correct conceptual understanding of the Dhamma. To
arrive at direct penetration, one must begin with a correct conceptual grasp of the
teaching and transform that grasp from intellectual comprehension to direct

perception by cultivating the threefold training in morality, concentration and
wisdom. If conceptual right view van be compared to a hand, a hand that
grasps the truth by way of concepts, then experiential right view can be
compared to an eye &#8212; the eye of wisdom that sees directly into the true
nature of existence ordinarily hidden from us by our greed, aversion and
delusion.
<!--l. 57214--><p class="indent" >   The Discourse on Right View is intended to elucidate the principles that are to be
comprehended by conceptual right view and penetrated by experiential right view.
The Venerable Sariputta expounds these principles under sixteen headings: the
wholesome and the unwholesome, the four nutriments of life, the Four Noble Truths,
the twelve factors of dependent arising, and the taints as the condition for ignorance.
It will be noted that from the second section to the end of the sutta, all the
expositions are framed in accordance with the same structure, which reveals the
principle of conditionality as the scaffolding for the entire teaching. Each
phenomenon to be comprehended by right view is expounded in terms of
its individual nature, its arising, its cessation, and the way leading to its
cessation. The grasp of this principle thus makes it clear that any entity
taken for examination is not an isolated occurrence with its being locked
up in itself, but part of a web of conditionally arisen processes that can
be terminated by understanding and eliminating the cause that gives it
being.
<!--l. 57231--><p class="indent" >   The right view arrived at by penetrating any of the sixteen subjects expounded in
the sutta is discussed in terms of two aspects, both aspects of supramundane
penetration. The first is the initial penetration of the supramundane path that
transforms a person from a worldling (puthujjana) into a stream-enterer (sotapanna),
a noble disciple who has entered irreversibly upon the stream to liberation. This
aspect of right view is indicated by the words that open each section, "(one)
who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true
Dhamma." These qualities are attributes only of the stream-enterer and those
of higher attainment along the path. The description thus applies to the
trainee (sekha), the disciple who has entered the path but has not yet reached
its end. The words signify right view as a transformative vision which has
revealed the ultimate truths underlying our existence, but which must still
be developed further to complete the full transformation it is capable of
effecting.
<!--l. 57247--><p class="indent" >   The second aspect of supramundane right view is indicated by the closing words
of each section, from "he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust" to "he
here and now makes an end of suffering." This description is fully applicable only to
the arahant, the liberated one, and thus indicates that the right view conceptually
grasped by the wise worldling, and transformed into direct perception with the
attainment of stream-entry, reaches its consummation with the arrival at
the teaching&#8217;s final goal, the attainment of complete emancipation from
suffering.
<!--l. 57257--><p class="indent" >   The translation of the Sammaditthi Sutta and its commentary presented here has
been adapted from manuscripts left behind by Bhikkhu 혀namoli. The translation of
the sutta has been adapted from Ven. 혀namoli&#8217;s complete translation of the

Majjhima Nikaya. The version used has been taken from the edition of the complete
Majjhima Nikaya translation that I prepared for publication by Wisdom
Publications in the United States. This version, tentatively scheduled for
release in late 1992, employs extensive substitution of Ven. 혀namoli&#8217;s own
technical terminology with my own preferred renderings of Pali doctrinal
terms.
<!--l. 57267--><p class="indent" >   The commentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta is from the Papa刃asudani, Acariya
Buddhaghosa&#8217;s complete commentary (atthakatha) to the Majjhima Nikaya. The
translation of the commentary has also been adapted from a rendering by Ven.
혀namoli, contained in a notebook of his that was discovered only a few years ago at
Island Hermitage. The terminology used in the notebook version suggests that it was
one of Ven. 혀namoli&#8217;s earliest attempts at translation from the Pali; it certainly
preceded his translation of the Visuddhimagga, The Path of Purification, first
completed at the end of 1953. In adapting the translation, I have naturally replaced
the technical terminology used in the notebook version with that used in the sutta.
In places I also decided to translate directly from the Pali text rather than
adhere to Ven. 혀namoli&#8217;s rendering, which sometimes tended to be literal to
the point of awkwardness. A few passages from the commentary that are
concerned solely with linguistic clarification have been omitted from the
translation.
<!--l. 57283--><p class="indent" >   Passages in the commentarial section enclosed in square brackets are taken from
the subcommentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta, by Acariya Dhammapala.
Passages in parenthesis are additions either by Ven. 혀namoli or by myself. The
paragraph numbering of the commentarial section follows that of the sutta.
The phrases of the sutta that are selected for comment have been set in
boldface [Not in this transcription &#8212; JTB]. The backnotes are entirely my
own.

<!--l. 57293--><p class="indent" >   Part One: The Discourse on Right View (Sammaditthi Sutta)
<!--l. 57295--><p class="indent" >   1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in
Jeta&#8217;s Grove, Anathapindika&#8217;s Park. There the Venerable Sariputta addressed the
bhikkhus thus: "Friends, bhikkhus." &#8212; "Friend," they replied. The Venerable
Sariputta said this:
<!--l. 57301--><p class="indent" >   2. "&#8217;One of right view, one of right view&#8217; is said, friends. In what way is a noble
disciple one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the
Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma?"
<!--l. 57306--><p class="indent" >   "Indeed, friend, we would come from far away to learn from the Venerable
Sariputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the Venerable Sariputta
would explain the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus
will remember it."
<!--l. 57311--><p class="indent" >   "Then, friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."
<!--l. 57314--><p class="indent" >   "Yes, friend," the bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sariputta said this:
<!--l. 57317--><p class="indent" >   The Wholesome and the Unwholesome
<!--l. 57319--><p class="indent" >   3. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome, the root of the
unwholesome, the wholesome, and the root of the wholesome, in that way he is one of
right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and

has arrived at this true Dhamma.
<!--l. 57325--><p class="indent" >   4. "And what, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the unwholesome,
what is the wholesome, what is the root of the wholesome? Killing living beings is
unwholesome; taking what is not given is unwholesome; misconduct in sensual
pleasures is unwholesome; false speech is unwholesome; malicious speech is
unwholesome; harsh speech is unwholesome; gossip is unwholesome; covetousness is
unwholesome; ill will is unwholesome; wrong view is unwholesome. This is called the
unwholesome.
<!--l. 57334--><p class="indent" >   5. "And what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed is a root of the
unwholesome; hate is a root of the unwholesome; delusion is a root of the
unwholesome. This is called the root of the unwholesome.
<!--l. 57338--><p class="indent" >   6. "And what is the wholesome? Abstention from killing living beings is
wholesome; abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome; abstention from
misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome; abstention from false speech is
wholesome; abstention from malicious speech is wholesome; abstention from harsh
speech is wholesome; abstention from gossip is wholesome; non-covetousness is
wholesome; non-ill will is wholesome; right view is wholesome. This is called the
wholesome.
<!--l. 57346--><p class="indent" >   7. "And what is the root of the wholesome? Non-greed is a root of the wholesome;
non-hate is a root of the wholesome; non-delusion is a root of the wholesome. This is
called the root of the wholesome.
<!--l. 57350--><p class="indent" >   8. "When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome, the root of the
unwholesome, the wholesome, and the root of the wholesome, he entirely abandons
the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion, he
extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit &#8217;I am,&#8217; and by
abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of
suffering. In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight,
who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true
Dhamma."
<!--l. 57360--><p class="indent" >   Nutriment
<!--l. 57362--><p class="indent" >   9. Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable
Sariputta&#8217;s words. Then they asked him a further question: "But, friend, might there
be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view... and has arrived at this
true Dhamma?" &#8212; "There might be, friends.
<!--l. 57369--><p class="indent" >   10. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the origin of
nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the cessation of
nutriment, in that way he is one of right view... and has arrived at this true
Dhamma.
<!--l. 57374--><p class="indent" >   11. "And what is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, what is the cessation
of nutriment, what is the way leading to the cessation of nutriment? There are these
four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that already have come to be
and for the support of those seeking a new existence. What four? They are physical
food as nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental volition
as the third; and consciousness as the fourth. With the arising of craving
there is the arising of nutriment. With the cessation of craving there is the
cessation of nutriment. The way leading to the cessation of nutriment is

just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right
concentration.
<!--l. 57387--><p class="indent" >   12. "When a noble disciple has thus understood nutriment, the origin of
nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the cessation of
nutriment, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to greed, he abolishes the
underlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view

<!--l. 57399--><p class="indent" >   13. Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable
Sariputta&#8217;s words. Then they asked him a further question: "But, friend, might there

<!--l. 57411--><p class="indent" >   15. "And what is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, what is the cessation of
suffering, what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? Birth is suffering;
aging is suffering; sickness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief and despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is suffering; in
short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering. This is called
suffering.
<!--l. 57419--><p class="indent" >   16. "And what is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which brings renewal of
being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is,
craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being and craving for non-being. This is
called the origin of suffering.
<!--l. 57425--><p class="indent" >   17. "And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading away
and ceasing, the giving up, relinquishing, letting go and rejecting of that same
craving. This is called the cessation of suffering.

Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view... right concentration. This is called the way

and death? The aging of beings in the various orders of beings, their old age,
brokenness of teeth, grayness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life, weakness of
faculties &#8212; this is called aging. The passing of beings out of the various orders of
beings, their passing away, dissolution, disappearance, dying, completion of time,
dissolution of the aggregates, laying down of the body &#8212; this is called death. So this
aging and this death are what is called aging and death. With the arising of birth

<!--l. 57845--><p class="indent" >   1. Thus have I heard: the Sammaditthi Sutta.
<!--l. 57847--><p class="indent" >   2. Herein, all such questions spoken by the Elder as " &#8217;One of right view, one of
right view&#8217; is said, friends. In what way is a noble disciple one of right view...?" or
"And what, friends, is the unwholesome...?" &#8212; these are questions showing a
desire to expound. Herein, since those who know, those who do not know,
those outside the Dispensation, those within it, those who speak by hearsay,
etc., and those who speak by personal knowledge, say "one of right view,"
therefore, taking it as an expression (common) to the many, he touched
upon it twice, saying "One of right view, one of right view" is said, friends
(sammaditthi sammaditthi ti avuso vuccati). The intention here is this: "Others
say &#8217;one of right view,&#8217; and still others say &#8217;one of right view.&#8217; Since that is
said, in what way, friends, is a noble disciple one of right view in respect of
meaning and characteristic?" Herein, one of right view is one possessing a lucid
and praiseworthy view (sobhanaya pasatthaya ca ditthiya samannagato).
But when this word "right view" is used to signify a state (rather than a
person endowed with that state), it then means a lucid and praiseworthy
view.1
<!--l. 57867--><p class="indent" >   This right view is twofold: mundane (lokiya) and supramundane (lokuttara).
Herein, the knowledge of kamma as one&#8217;s own and knowledge which is in conformity
with the (Four Noble) Truths are mundane right view; or, in brief, (mundane right
view is) all understanding that is accompanied by the taints.2 Understanding
connected with the noble paths and fruits is supramundane right view.3 The person
possessing right view is of three kinds: the worldling (puthujjana), the disciple in
higher training (sekha), and the one beyond training (asekha). Herein, the worldling
is of two kinds: one outside the Dispensation and one within the Dispensation.
Herein, one outside the Dispensation who believes in kamma is one of right
view on account of the view of kamma as one&#8217;s own, but not on account of
that which is in conformity with the truths, because he holds to the view
of self. One within the Dispensation is of right view on account of both.
The disciple in higher training is one of right view on account of fixed right
view,4 the one beyond training on account of (the right view) that is beyond
training.5
<!--l. 57884--><p class="indent" >   But here "one of right view" is intended as one possessing supramundane
wholesome right view, which is fixed in destiny and emancipating. Hence he said:
whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has
arrived at this true Dhamma (ujugata&#8217;ssa ditthi dhamme aveccappasadena
samannagato agato imam saddhammam). Because of its going straight without
deviating to either extreme, or because of its going straight by removing all
crookedness such as bodily crookedness, etc., supramundane right view is
"straight." One possessing that view also possesses perfect confidence, unshakable
confidence, in the ninefold supramundane Dhamma.6 And by becoming
disentangled from all the thickets of (wrong) views, by abandoning all the

defilements, by departing from the round of rebirths, by bringing the practice to its
consummation, he is said to have come by the noble path to this "true Dhamma"
proclaimed by the Enlightened One, that is, Nibbana, the plunge into the
Deathless.

unwholesome called the ten courses of unwholesome kamma (action), penetrating this

And he understands the unwholesome root which has become the root condition of
that (unwholesome), penetrating this, in the same way, as "This is the origin of
suffering." The same method applies here also in regard to "the wholesome"
and "the root of the wholesome." And, as it is here, so in all the following

<!--l. 57916--><p class="indent" >   In that way (ettavata pi): by this much; by this understanding of the

right attention occurred in detail.
<!--l. 57925--><p class="indent" >   But in the second section (Section 4) it should be understood that the teaching
too, as well as the penetration through attention, is stated in detail.
<!--l. 57929--><p class="indent" >   Herein, the bhikkhus [at the council at the Great Monastery held to rehearse the
Pitakas] said: "In the brief exposition the two lower paths are discussed, in the
detailed exposition the two higher paths," taking into account the passage at the end
of the sections setting forth the detailed exposition that begins "he entirely abandons
the underlying tendency to lust." But the Elder (presiding over the council) said: "In
the brief exposition the four paths are expounded as a group, and also in the detailed
exposition."7
<!--l. 57939--><p class="indent" >   This query into the brief and detailed expositions which has been cleared up here
should be understood in all the following sections in the way stated here. From here
on we shall only comment on terms that are new or obscure.
<!--l. 57944--><p class="indent" >   The Unwholesome Courses of Action
<!--l. 57946--><p class="indent" >   4. Herein, firstly, in the detailed exposition of the first section: as regards the
passage beginning killing living beings is unwholesome (panatipato kho avuso
akusalam), "unwholesome" should be understood by way of the occurrence of
unwholesomeness, or as what is opposed to the wholesome, which is to be dealt with
below (Section 6). As to characteristic, it is blameworthy and has painful result, or it
is defiled. This, in the first place, is the comment upon the general terms
here.
<!--l. 57955--><p class="indent" >   But as regards the particular terms, the phrase killing living beings means the
slaughter of a living being, the destruction of a living being. And here a living being
(pana) is, according to ordinary usage, a being (satta); in the ultimate sense it is
the life faculty. "Killing living beings" is the volition to kill on the part of

one who is aware, in respect of a living being, that it is a living being, and
which (volition), manifesting itself through one or the other of the doors of
body and speech, initiates activity resulting in the cutting off of the life
faculty.
<!--l. 57965--><p class="indent" >   In relation to beings such as animals, etc., which lack moral qualities (guna), it is
less blameworthy in respect of small living beings and more blameworthy in respect
of beings with large bodies. Why? Because of the magnitude of the effort involved.
And when the effort involved is equal, because of the magnitude of the object (the
being killed). In relation to beings such as humans, etc., who possess moral qualities,
it is less blameworthy in respect of beings with few good qualities and more
blameworthy in respect of beings with great qualities. When the size of the body and
moral qualities are equal, however, it is less blameworthy when the defilements and
activity are mild, and more blameworthy when they are strong: so it should be
understood.
<!--l. 57977--><p class="indent" >   There are five constituents for this (act of killing a living being): a living being,
awareness that it is a living being, the mind to kill, activity, and the death (of the
being) thereby.
<!--l. 57981--><p class="indent" >   There are six means: one&#8217;s own person, command, a missile, a fixed contrivance, a

<!--l. 57984--><p class="indent" >   To explore this matter in detail, however, would involve too much diffuseness.
Therefore we shall not explore it in detail, or any other subject similar in kind. Those
who wish to go into the matter may do so by looking it up in the Samantapasadika,
the Vinaya Commentary.8
<!--l. 57989--><p class="indent" >   Taking what is not given (adinnadana): the carrying off of others&#8217; goods,
stealing, robbery, is what is meant. Herein, "what is not given" is another&#8217;s
possession, which the other may use as he likes without incurring penalty or
blame. "Taking what is not given" is the volition to steal on the part of
one who is aware, in respect of another&#8217;s possession, that it is another&#8217;s
possession, and which (volition) initiates activity resulting in the taking of that
thing.
<!--l. 57998--><p class="indent" >   That (taking of what is not given) is less blameworthy when the other&#8217;s property
is of low value, and more blameworthy when it is of high value. Why? Because of the
high value of the object (stolen). When the value of the objects is equal, the act is
more blameworthy when the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities, and less
blameworthy when the object belongs to one who, in comparison, is inferior with
respect to moral qualities.
<!--l. 58006--><p class="indent" >   There are five constituents of this act: another&#8217;s possession, awareness that it is
another&#8217;s possession, the mind to steal, the activity, and the carrying off (of the
object) thereby.
<!--l. 58010--><p class="indent" >   There are six means: one&#8217;s own person, etc. (as for killing).
<!--l. 58012--><p class="indent" >   And these (acts of stealing) may be classed, according to the way in which they
occur, by way of the following: taking by theft, by force, by concealment, by
stratagem, by fraud. This here is in brief; the details, however, are given in the
Samantapasadika.9
<!--l. 58017--><p class="indent" >   Misconduct in sensual pleasures (kamesu micchacara): here, "in sensual pleasures"
(kamesu) means in regard to sexual intercourse. "Misconduct" is entirely

reprehensible vile conduct. As to characteristic, sexual misconduct is the volition to
transgress bounds occurring through the body door by way of unrighteous
intent.
<!--l. 58024--><p class="indent" >   Herein, out of bounds for men, firstly, are the twenty kinds of women, that is, the
ten beginning with those protected by the mother, namely, "protected by
the mother, protected by the father, protected by the mother and father,
protected by the brother, protected by the sister, protected by relatives,
protected by the clan, protected by the law, under protection, entailing a
penalty"; and the ten beginning with those purchased with money, namely, "one
purchased with money, one who lives (with a man) by her own desire, one
who lives (with a man) on account of wealth, one who lives (with a man)
on account of cloth, one who is given (in marriage with the ceremony of)
dipping the hand in water, one who has been (taken to wife and) relieved of
her burden-carrying head-pad, one who is a slave and a wife, one who is a
servant and a wife, one who is carried off in a raid, one engaged at so much a
time."10
<!--l. 58039--><p class="indent" >   Then, as concerns women, for the twelve kinds of women consisting of the two,
namely, under protection and entailing a penalty, and the ten beginning with those
purchased with money, other men are out of bounds.
<!--l. 58044--><p class="indent" >   This sexual misconduct is less blameworthy when (the person) out of bounds is
without good qualities such as virtue, etc., and more blameworthy when (the person)
possesses good qualities such as virtue, etc. There are four constituents of this act: an
object which is out of bounds, the mind to engage in that, the effort to engage, and
consent to the union of sexual organs.11 The means is single: one&#8217;s own
person.
<!--l. 58051--><p class="indent" >   False speech (musavada): "false" (musa) is the verbal effort or bodily effort for
destroying welfare (made) by one bent on deceiving. "False speech" is the volition
initiating the verbal effort or bodily effort of deceiving another on the part of one
intent on deceiving. According to another method, "false" means an unreal,
untrue case, "speech" the communication of that as being real, true. As to
characteristic, "false speech" is the volition of one desiring to communicate to
another an untrue case as being true, which (volition) initiates such an act of
communication.
<!--l. 58062--><p class="indent" >   This is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight, and more
blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is great. Further, when it occurs on the part
of householders who, not wishing to give away some belonging of theirs, say "I do not
have it," it is less blameworthy; when one who is a witness speaks (falsely) for the
purpose of destroying another&#8217;s welfare, it is more blameworthy. In the case of those
gone forth, when it occurs by their saying as a joke, after they have obtained just a
little oil or ghee, in the manner of the Puranas, "Today the oil is flowing in the
village just like a river," then it is less blameworthy; but for those who speak (as
a witness) saying that they have seen what they have not seen it is more
blameworthy.
<!--l. 58075--><p class="indent" >   There are four constituents of this act: an untrue case, the mind to deceive, the
appropriate effort, the communicating of that meaning to another. The means is
single: one&#8217;s own person only. That is to be regarded as the performing of the action

of deceiving another by means of the body or by means of something attached to the
body or by means of speech. If, through that action, the other understands that
meaning, one is bound by the kamma of false speech at the very moment of the
volition initiating the action.
<!--l. 58084--><p class="indent" >   Malicious speech, etc.: The kind of speech that creates in the heart of the person
to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness (of affection) for another is
malicious speech (pisuna vaca). The kind of speech by which one makes both oneself
and another harsh, the kind of speech which is also itself harsh, being pleasant
neither to the ear nor to the heart &#8212; that is harsh speech (pharusa vaca). That by
which one gossips idly, without meaning, is gossip (samphappalapa). Also, the
volition that is the root cause of these gains the name "malicious speech," etc. And
that only is intended here.
<!--l. 58095--><p class="indent" >   Therein, malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind, which
(volition) initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division among
others or to endear oneself (to another). It is less blameworthy when the person
divided has few good qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one
has great qualities. Its constituents are four: another person to be divided,
the intention to divide, (thinking) "Thus these will be separated and split"
or the desire to endear oneself, (thinking) "Thus I shall become loved and
intimate," the appropriate effort, the communicating of that meaning to that
person.
<!--l. 58106--><p class="indent" >   Harsh speech is the entirely harsh volition initiating an effort by body or by
speech to wound another&#8217;s vital feelings. This is an example given for the purpose of
making it clear: A village boy, it is said, went to the forest without heeding his
mother&#8217;s words. Unable to make him turn back, she scolded him angrily, saying:
"May a wild buffalo chase you!" Then a buffalo appeared before him right there in
the forest. The boy made an asseveration of truth, saying: "Let it not be
as my mother said but as she thought!" The buffalo stood as though tied
there. Thus, although the means (employed) was that of wounding the vital
feelings, because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speech. For
sometimes parents even say to their children, "May robbers chop you to pieces!"
yet they do not even wish a lotus leaf to fall upon them. And teachers and
preceptors sometimes say to their pupils, "What is the use of these shameless and
heedless brats? Drive them out!" yet they wish for their success in learning and
attainment.
<!--l. 58124--><p class="indent" >   Just as, through gentleness of mind, speech is not harsh, so through gentleness of
speech, speech does not become unharsh; for the words "Let him sleep in peace"
spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh speech. But harsh speech is such on
account of harshness of mind only. It is less blameworthy when the person to whom it
is spoken has few good qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one has great
qualities. Its constituents are three: another to be abused, an angry mind, the
abusing.
<!--l. 58133--><p class="indent" >   Gossip is the unwholesome volition initiating an effort by body or by speech to
communicate what is purposeless. It is less blameworthy when indulged in mildly,
and more blameworthy when indulged in strongly. Its constituents are two: the being
intent on purposeless stories such as the Bharata war or the abduction of Sita, etc.,

and the telling of such stories.12
<!--l. 58140--><p class="indent" >   Covetousness (abhijjha): It covets, thus it is covetousness; "having become
directed towards others&#8217; goods, it occurs through inclination towards them" is the
meaning. It has the characteristic of coveting others&#8217; goods thus: "Oh, that this were
mine!" It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of taking what is
not given. Its constituents are two: another&#8217;s goods, and the inclination for
them to be one&#8217;s own. For even though greed has arisen based on another&#8217;s
goods, it is not classed as a (completed) course of kamma so long as one does
not incline to them as one&#8217;s own (with the thought), "Oh, that this were
mine!"
<!--l. 58152--><p class="indent" >   Ill will (byapada): It injures welfare and happiness, thus it is ill will (hitasukham
byapadayati ti byapado). Its characteristic is the mental defect (of wishing for) the
destruction of others. It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of
harsh speech. Its constituents are two: another being, and the wish for that being&#8217;s
destruction. For even though anger has arisen based on another being, there is no
breach of a course of kamma so long as one does not wish, "Oh, that this being might
be cut off and destroyed!"
<!--l. 58161--><p class="indent" >   Wrong view (micchaditthi): It sees wrongly due to the absence of a correct
grasp of things, thus it is wrong view. Its characteristic is the mistaken view
that "there is no (result from) giving," etc. It is less blameworthy and more
blameworthy as in the case of gossip. Moreover, it is less blameworthy when
not fixed in destiny, and more blameworthy when fixed.13 Its constituents
are two: a mistaken manner of grasping the basis (for the view), and the
appearance of that (basis) in accordance with the manner in which it has been
grasped.
<!--l. 58171--><p class="indent" >   Now the exposition of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma should be
understood in five ways: as to mental state (dhammato), as to category
(kotthasato), as to object (arammanato), as to feeling (vedanato), and as to root
(mulato).
<!--l. 58176--><p class="indent" >   Herein, as to mental state: The first seven among these are volitional states only.
The three beginning with covetousness are associated with volition.14
<!--l. 58180--><p class="indent" >   As to category: The eight consisting of the first seven and wrong view are
courses of kamma only, not roots. Covetousness and ill will are courses of
kamma and also roots; for covetousness, having arrived at the (state of) a
root, is the unwholesome root greed, and ill will is the unwholesome root
hate.
<!--l. 58186--><p class="indent" >   As to object: Killing living beings, because it has the life faculty as object, has a
formation as object. Taking what is not given has beings as object or formations as
object. Misconduct in sensual pleasures has formations as object by way of tangible
object; but some say it also has beings as object. False speech has beings or
formations as object; likewise malicious speech. Harsh speech has only beings as
object. Gossip has either beings or formations as object by way of the seen, heard,
sensed and cognized; likewise covetousness. Ill will has only beings as object. Wrong
view has formations as object by way of the states belonging to the three planes (of
being).
<!--l. 58197--><p class="indent" >   As to feeling: Killing living beings has painful feeling; for although kings, seeing a

robber, say laughingly, "Go and execute him," their volition consummating
the action is associated only with pain. Taking what is not given has three
feelings. Misconduct (in sensual pleasures) has two feelings, pleasant and
neutral, but in the mind which consummates the action there is no neutral
feeling. False speech has three feelings; likewise malicious speech. Harsh speech
has painful feeling only. Gossip has three feelings. Covetousness has two
feelings, pleasant and neutral; likewise wrong view. Ill will has painful feeling
only.
<!--l. 58208--><p class="indent" >   As to root: Killing living beings has two roots, by way of hate and delusion;
taking what is not given, by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and
delusion; misconduct, by way of greed and delusion; false speech, by way of hate and
delusion or by way of greed and delusion; likewise for malicious speech and gossip;
harsh speech, by way of hate and delusion. Covetousness has one root, by way of
delusion; likewise ill will. Wrong view has two roots, by way of greed and
delusion.
<!--l. 58216--><p class="indent" >   The Unwholesome Roots
<!--l. 58218--><p class="indent" >   5. Greed is a root of the unwholesome, etc.: It is greedy, thus it is greed (lubbhati
ti lobho); it offends against (it hates), thus it is hate (dussati ti doso); it deludes, thus
it is delusion (muyhati ti moho). Among these, greed is itself unwholesome in the
sense that it is blameworthy and has painful results; and it is a root of these
unwholesome (deeds) beginning with killing living beings, for some in the sense
that it is an associated originative cause, for some in the sense that it is a
decisive support condition. Thus it is an unwholesome root. This too is said:
"One who is lustful, friends, overwhelmed and with mind obsessed by lust,
kills a living being" (A.3:71/i,216; text slightly different). The same method
applies to the state of being unwholesome roots in the cases of hate and
delusion.
<!--l. 58232--><p class="indent" >   The Wholesome Courses of Action
<!--l. 58234--><p class="indent" >   6. Abstention from killing living beings is wholesome (panatipata veramani), etc.:
Here "killing living beings," etc. have the same meaning as aforesaid. It crushes the
hostile, thus it is abstention (veram manati ti veramani); the meaning is that it
abandons the hostile. Or: with that as the instrument one abstains (viramati), the
syllable ve being substituted for the syllable vi. This here is, in the first place, the
commentary on the phrasing.
<!--l. 58242--><p class="indent" >   But as to the meaning, abstention is refraining (virati) associated with wholesome
consciousness. What is stated thus: "For one refraining from killing living beings,
that which is on that occasion the leaving off, the refraining" (Vibh. 285), that is the
refraining associated with wholesome consciousness. As to kind, it is threefold:
refraining in the presence of opportunity, refraining because of an undertaking, and
refraining because of eradication (of defilements).
<!--l. 58251--><p class="indent" >   Herein, refraining in the presence of an opportunity (sampattavirati) is to be
understood as the refraining which occurs in those who have not undertaken any
training rule but who do not transgress when an opportunity for doing so presents
itself because they reflect upon their birth, age, learning, etc., like the lay follower
Cakkana in the island of Sri Lanka.
<!--l. 58258--><p class="indent" >   When he was a boy, it is said, his mother developed an illness, and the doctor

said, "Fresh hare&#8217;s flesh is needed." Then Cakkana&#8217;s brother sent him, saying, "Go,
dear, and hunt in the field." He went there. On that occasion a hare had come to eat
the young corn. On seeing him it bolted swiftly, but it got entangled in a
creeper and squealed "kiri, kiri." Guided by the sound, Cakkana went and
caught it, thinking, "I will make medicine for my mother." Then he thought
again, "This is not proper for me, that I should deprive another of life for
the sake of my mother&#8217;s life." So he released it, saying "Go and enjoy the
grass and the water with the other hares in the forest." When his brother
asked him, "Did you get a hare, dear?" he told him what had happened.
His brother scolded him. He went to his mother and determined upon an
asseveration of truth: "Since I was born I am not aware that I have ever
intentionally deprived a living being of life." Straightaway his mother became
well.
<!--l. 58277--><p class="indent" >   Refraining because of an undertaking (samadanavirati) is to be understood as the
refraining which occurs in those who do not transgress in a particular case because
they have undertaken training rules, giving up even their own lives in the
undertaking of the training rules and in what is superior to that, like the lay follower
who dwelt at Uttaravaddhamana Mountain.
<!--l. 58284--><p class="indent" >   It is said that after undertaking the training rules from the Elder Pingala
Buddharakkhita who lived in the Ambariya Monastery, he was plowing a field. Then
his ox got lost. Searching for it, he climbed up Uttaravaddhamana Mountain.
There a large serpent seized him. He thought, "Let me cut off his head with
this sharp axe." Then he thought again, "This is not proper for me, that I
should break a training rule that I have undertaken in the presence of my
honored teacher." Thinking up to the third time, "I will give up my life but
not the training rule," he threw the sharp hand axe that was slung on his
shoulder into the forest. Straightaway the creature released him and went
away.
<!--l. 58296--><p class="indent" >   Refraining because of eradication (of defilements) (samucchedavirati) is to be
understood as the refraining associated with the noble path. After the arising of this
even the thought, "I will kill a living being," does not occur to the noble
persons.
<!--l. 58301--><p class="indent" >   This refraining is called "wholesome" (kusala) because of the occurrence of
wholesomeness (kosalla); or because of shedding the vile (kucchitassa salanato). Also,
evil conduct is commonly called "weeds" (kusa) and it mows this down (lunati), thus
it is called "wholesome."
<!--l. 58307--><p class="indent" >   As in the case of the unwholesome, so for these courses of wholesome kamma the
exposition should be understood in five ways: as to mental state, as to category, as to
object, as to feeling, and as to root.
<!--l. 58311--><p class="indent" >   Herein, as to mental state: The first seven among these can be both volitions and
abstinences; the last three are associated with volition only.
<!--l. 58315--><p class="indent" >   As to category: The first seven are courses of kamma only, not roots. The last
three are courses of kamma and also roots. For non-covetousness, having
arrived at the (state of) a root, is the wholesome root non-greed; non-ill
will is the wholesome root non-hate; and right view is the wholesome root
non-delusion.

<!--l. 58321--><p class="indent" >   As to object: The objects of these are the same as the objects of killing living
beings, etc. For abstention is spoken of in relation to something which can be
transgressed. But just as the noble path, which has Nibbana as object, abandons the
defilements, so too should these courses of kamma, which have the life faculty, etc., as
object, be understood to abandon the kinds of evil conduct beginning with killing
living beings.
<!--l. 58329--><p class="indent" >   As to feeling: All have pleasant feeling or neutral feeling. For there is no painful
feeling which arrives at the wholesome.
<!--l. 58332--><p class="indent" >   As to root: The first seven courses of kamma have three roots by way of
non-greed, non-hate, and non-delusion in one who abstains by means of consciousness
associated with knowledge. They have two roots in one who abstains by means of
consciousness dissociated from knowledge.15 Non-covetousness has two roots in one
who abstains by means of consciousness associated with knowledge, one root (in one
who abstains) by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge. Non-greed,
however, is not by itself its own root. The same method applies in the case
of non-ill will. Right view always has two roots, by way of non-greed and
non-hate.16
<!--l. 58343--><p class="indent" >   The Wholesome Roots
<!--l. 58345--><p class="indent" >   7. Non-greed is a root of the wholesome (alobho kusalamulam), etc.: Non-greed is
not greed; this is a term for the state that is opposed to greed. The same method
applies in the case of non-hate and non-delusion. Among these, non-greed is
itself wholesome; and it is a root of these wholesome (courses of kamma)
beginning with abstention from killing living beings, for some in the sense that
it is an associated originative cause and for some in the sense that it is a
decisive support condition. Thus it is a wholesome root. The same method
applies to the state of being wholesome roots in the cases of non-hate and
non-delusion.
<!--l. 58355--><p class="indent" >   Conclusion on the Unwholesome and the Wholesome
<!--l. 58357--><p class="indent" >   8. Now, summing up the meaning of all that has been set forth in brief and in
detail, he states the concluding section beginning with the words when a noble
disciple. Herein, has thus understood the wholesome (evam akusalam pajanati)
means: has thus understood the unwholesome by way of the ten courses of
unwholesome kamma as described. The same method applies in the case of the root
of the unwholesome, etc.
<!--l. 58364--><p class="indent" >   Up to this point, by a single method, emancipation as far as arahantship has been
expounded for one who has the Four Noble Truths as his meditation subject. How?
Here, the ten courses of unwholesome kamma with the exception of covetousness, and
the (ten) courses of wholesome kamma, are the truth of suffering. These two states &#8212;
covetousness and the greed which is a root of the unwholesome &#8212; are, literally
speaking, the truth of the origin. Speaking figuratively, however, all the courses of
kamma are the truth of suffering, and all the wholesome and unwholesome roots are
the truth of the origin.17 The non-occurrence of both is the truth of cessation.
The noble path fully understanding suffering, abandoning its origin, and
understanding its cessation is the truth of the path. Thus two truths are stated in
their own nature and two are to be understood by way of the guideline of
conversion.18

<!--l. 58379--><p class="indent" >   He entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust (so sabbaso raganusayam
pahaya): Understanding thus the unwholesome, etc., he abandons in all ways the
underlying tendency to lust. He abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion
(patighanusayam pativinodetva): and he removes in all ways too the underlying
tendency to aversion, is what is meant. Up to this point the path of non-return is
stated.19 He extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit "I am"
(asmi ti ditthimananusayam samuhanitva): he extricates the underlying tendency to
the view and conceit which occurs in the mode of grasping the five aggregates as a
group (with the notion) "I am," due to failure to distinguish any state among
them.
<!--l. 58391--><p class="indent" >   Therein, by the phrase the underlying tendency to the view and conceit "I am"
(ditthimananusayam) what is meant is the underlying tendency to conceit which is
similar to a view (ditthisadisam mananusayam). For this underlying tendency
to conceit is similar to a view because it occurs (with the notion) "I am";
therefore it is stated thus. And one who wishes to understand this conceit "I
am" in detail should look up the Khemaka Sutta in the Khandhiyavagga
(S.22:89/iii,126ff.).
<!--l. 58400--><p class="indent" >   By abandoning ignorance (avijjam pahaya): having abandoned ignorance, the root
of the round (of existence). And arousing true knowledge (vijjam uppadetva): having
aroused the true knowledge of the path of arahantship which completely extricates
that ignorance. At this point the path of arahantship is stated.20 He here
and now makes an end of suffering (ditth&#8217;eva dhamme dukkhass&#8217;antakaro
hoti): in this very existence he becomes one who cuts off the suffering of the
round.
<!--l. 58408--><p class="indent" >   In that way too (ettavatapi kho avuso): he marks off (this first part of) the
teaching; by way of the attention and penetration stated in this exposition of
the courses of kamma, is what is meant. The rest is as aforesaid. Thus he
concludes the exposition by means of the path of non-return and the path of
arahantship.
<!--l. 58414--><p class="indent" >   The Four Nutriments: General
<!--l. 58416--><p class="indent" >   9. Saying, "Good, friend,"... (etc.)..." and has arrived at this true Dhamma":
Thus, having heard the Venerable Sariputta&#8217;s exposition of the four truths
under the heading of the wholesome and the unwholesome, the bhikkhus
delighted in his words with the statement, "Good, friend," and rejoiced with the
mind that aroused that statement; what is meant is that they agreed by
word and approved by mind. Now, because the Elder was competent to give
an exposition on the four truths in diverse ways &#8212; as (the Blessed One)
said: "Bhikkhus, Sariputta is able to propound, to teach, the Four Noble
Truths in detail" (M.141/iii, 248); or because he had said "in that way too,"
being desirous of giving a further exposition, the bhikkhus, being desirous
of hearing the teaching of the four truths by another method, asked him
a further question. By asking "But, friend, might there be another way?
Would there be another case?" they asked another question additional to that
question asked and answered (already) by the Venerable Sariputta himself. Or
what is meant is that they asked a question subsequent to the previous one.
Then, answering them, the Elder said, "There might be, friends," and so

on.
<!--l. 58437--><p class="indent" >   10. Herein, this is the elucidation of the terms that are not clear. Nutriment
(ahara) is a condition (paccaya). For a condition nourishes its own fruit, therefore it
is called nutriment.21
<!--l. 58441--><p class="indent" >   11. Of beings that already have come to be (bhutanam va sattanam), etc.: Here
come to be (bhuta) means come to birth, reborn; seeking a new existence
(sambhavesinam) means those who seek, search for, existence, birth, production.
Therein, among the four kinds of generation,22 beings born from eggs and from
the womb are said to be "seeking a new existence" as long as they have
not broken out of the eggshell or the placenta. When they have broken out
of the eggshell or the placenta and emerged outside, they are said to have
"come to be." The moisture-born and the spontaneously born are said to be
"seeking a new existence" at the first moment of consciousness; from the
second moment of consciousness onwards they are said to have "come to
be."
<!--l. 58454--><p class="indent" >   Or alternatively, "come to be" is born, reproduced; this is a term for those who
have destroyed the cankers (arahants), who are reckoned thus: "They have come to
be only, but they will not come to be again." "Seeking a new existence" means they
seek a new existence; this is a term for worldlings and disciples in higher training who
seek a new existence in the future too, because they have not abandoned
the fetter of being. Thus by these two terms he includes all beings in all
ways.
<!--l. 58464--><p class="indent" >   For the maintenance (thitiya); for the purpose of maintaining. For the support
(anuggahaya): for the purpose of supporting, for the purpose of helping. This is
merely a difference of words, but the meaning of the two terms is one only. Or
alternatively, "for the maintenance" is for the non-interruption of this or that being
by means of the serial connection of arisen states. "For the support" is for the arising
of unarisen (states). And both these expressions should be regarded as applicable
in both cases thus: "For the maintenance and support of those that have
come to be, and for the maintenance and support of those seeking a new
existence."
<!--l. 58476--><p class="indent" >   The Four Kinds of Nutriment
<!--l. 58478--><p class="indent" >   Physical food as nutriment (lit. "food made into a ball") (kabalinkaro aharo) is
nutriment that can be swallowed after making it into a ball; this is a term for the
nutritive essence which has as its basis boiled rice, junket, etc.23 Gross or subtle
(olariko va sukhumo va): it is gross because of the grossness of the basis, and subtle
because of the subtlety of the basis. But because physical nutriment is included in
subtle materiality, by way of its individual essence it is subtle only.24 And also that
grossness and subtlety should be understood relatively in respect of the
basis.
<!--l. 58488--><p class="indent" >   The nutriment of peacocks is subtle compared with the nutriment of
crocodiles. Crocodiles, they say, swallow stones, and these dissolve on reaching
their stomachs. Peacocks eat such animals as snakes, scorpions, etc. But the
nutriment of hyenas is subtle compared with the nutriment of peacocks.
These, they say, eat horns and bones thrown away three years before, and
these become soft as yams as soon as they are moistened with their saliva.

Also, the nutriment of elephants is subtle compared with the nutriment of
hyenas. For these eat the branches of various trees, etc. The nutriment of the
gayal buffalo, the antelope, the deer, etc., is subtler than the nutriment of
elephants. These, they say, eat the sapless leaves of various kinds of trees, etc.
The nutriment of cows is subtler than their nutriment; they eat fresh and
dried grass. The nutriment of hares is subtler than their nutriment; that of
birds is subtler than that of hares; that of barbarians is subtler than that
of birds; that of village headmen is subtler than that of barbarians; that
of kings and kings&#8217; ministers is subtler than village headmens&#8217;; that of a
Wheel-turning Monarch is subtler than their nutriment. The earth deities&#8217;
nutriment is subtler than that of a Wheel-turning Monarch. The nutriment of the
deities of the Four Great Kings is subtler than that of the earth deities. Thus
nutriment should be elaborated up to that of the deities who wield power
over others&#8217; creations.25 But saying, "Their nutriment is subtle," the end is
reached.
<!--l. 58512--><p class="indent" >   And here, in a basis that is gross, the nutritive essence is limited and weak; in one
that is subtle, it is strong. Thus one who has drunk even a full bowl of gruel is soon
hungry again and desirous of eating anything; but after drinking even a small amount
of ghee, he will not want to eat for the whole day. Therein, it is the basis that dispels
fatigue, but it is unable to preserve; but the nutritive essence preserves, though it
cannot dispel fatigue. But when the two are combined they both dispel fatigue and
preserve.
<!--l. 58521--><p class="indent" >   Contact as the second (phasso dutiyo): The sixfold contact beginning with
eye-contact should be understood as the second of these four kinds of nutriment. And
this is the method of the teaching itself; therefore it should not be inquired into
here, saying "For this reason it is the second, or the third." Mental volition
(manosancetana): volition (cetana) itself is stated. Consciousness (vi章anam): any
kind of consciousness whatever.
<!--l. 58529--><p class="indent" >   It may be asked here: "If the meaning of condition is the meaning of nutriment,
then, when other conditions also exist for beings, why are only these four stated?" It
should be said in reply: "It is because they are the special conditions for personal
continuity." For physical nutriment is the special condition for the material body of
beings that eat physical nutriment; as regards the group of mental constituents,
contact is (the special condition) for feeling, mental volition for consciousness, and
consciousness for mentality-materiality. As it is said: "Just as, bhikkhus, this
body has nutriment for its maintenance, is maintained in dependence on
nutriment, and without nutriment is not maintained" (S.46:2/v,64); and
likewise: "With contact as condition, feeling;... with formations as condition,
consciousness;... with consciousness as condition, mentality-materiality" (S.12:1/ii,1,
etc.).
<!--l. 58544--><p class="indent" >   What is this nutriment, and what does it nourish? Physical nutriment nourishes
the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth;26 contact as nutriment nourishes the
three feelings; mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of
being; consciousness as nutriment nourishes the mentality-materiality of
rebirth-linking.
<!--l. 58550--><p class="indent" >   How? As soon as it is placed in the mouth, physical food as nutriment brings into

being the eight kinds of materiality (aforesaid). Then each lump of cooked rice
ground by the teeth, on being swallowed, brings into being unit after unit of the eight
kinds of materiality. Thus it nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as
eighth.
<!--l. 58556--><p class="indent" >   But with contact as nutriment, when contact productive of pleasant feeling arises
it nourishes pleasant feeling; contact productive of painful feeling nourishes painful
feeling; contact productive of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling nourishes
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Thus in all ways contact as nutriment nourishes
the three kinds of feeling.
<!--l. 58562--><p class="indent" >   In the case of mental volition as nutriment, kamma leading to sense-sphere being
nourishes sense-sphere being; kamma leading to fine-material and immaterial being
nourishes its respective kind of being. Thus in all ways mental volition as nutriment
nourishes the three kinds of being.
<!--l. 58568--><p class="indent" >   But with consciousness as nutriment, it is said that it nourishes, by way of
conascence condition, etc., the three (immaterial) aggregates associated with itself at
the moment of rebirth-linking and the thirty kinds of materiality that arise by way of
triple continuity. Thus consciousness nourishes the mentality-materiality of
rebirth-linking.27
<!--l. 58574--><p class="indent" >   And here, by the words "mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of
being," only the wholesome and unwholesome volition accompanied by taints is
meant; by the words "consciousness nourishes the mentality-materiality
of rebirth-linking," only rebirth-linking consciousness is meant. However,
these are to be understood indiscriminately as nutriments as well because
they nourish the states that are associated with them and originated by
them.
<!--l. 58583--><p class="indent" >   The Four Functions
<!--l. 58585--><p class="indent" >   As regards these four kinds of nutriment, physical food as nutriment accomplishes
the function of nutriment by sustaining, contact by contacting (touching), mental
volition by accumulating, consciousness by cognizing.
<!--l. 58589--><p class="indent" >   How? Physical food as nutriment, by sustaining, is for the maintenance of beings
by maintaining the body. For this body, though generated by kamma, is sustained by
physical food and stands for ten years or a hundred years up to the end of the
life-span. Like what? Like a child which, though given birth by the mother, is
nurtured by the milk, etc., given to him to drink by the wet-nurse and thus lives long.
Also, as a house is supported by a prop. This too has been said (untraced):
"Great king, just as, when a house is collapsing, they prop it up with other
timber, and that house, being propped up by other timber, does not collapse,
so too this body is supported by nutriment, persists in dependence upon
nutriment."
<!--l. 58601--><p class="indent" >   Thus physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by
sustaining. Accomplishing it thus, physical food as nutriment becomes a condition for
two material continuities, namely, for that originated by nutriment and that
kammically acquired.28 It is a condition for the kamma-born materiality by becoming
its preserver. It is a condition for that originated by nutriment by becoming its
producer.
<!--l. 58608--><p class="indent" >   Then contact, by contacting the object which is the basis for pleasure, etc., is "for

the maintenance of beings" by causing the occurrence of pleasant feeling, etc. Mental
volition, accumulating by way of wholesome and unwholesome kamma, is "for the
maintenance of beings" because it provides the root of existence. Consciousness, by
cognizing, is "for the maintenance of beings" by causing the occurrence of
mentality-materiality.
<!--l. 58617--><p class="indent" >   The Four Dangers
<!--l. 58619--><p class="indent" >   Now, while these are accomplishing their function of nutriment by sustaining,
etc., four dangers are to be seen: the danger of desire in the case of physical food as
nutriment; the danger of approach in the case of contact; (the danger) of
accumulating in the case of mental volition; and (the danger) of launching [into a
new existence here or there by way of taking rebirth-linking] in the case of
consciousness.
<!--l. 58626--><p class="indent" >   What are the reasons (for this)? Because, having aroused desire for physical food,
beings face cold, etc., to undertake such work as checking, accounting, etc., and incur
not a little suffering. And some who have gone forth in this dispensation seek
nutriment through such improper means as the practice of medicine, etc., and they
are to be censured here and now, and hereafter they become "recluse ghosts" in the
manner described thus in the Lakkhana Samyutta: "And his outer robe was burning,
blazing," etc.29 For this reason, desire itself is to be understood as the danger in
physical food as nutriment.
<!--l. 58637--><p class="indent" >   Those who approach contact, who find gratification in contact, commit crimes in
respect of others&#8217; guarded and protected belongings, such as their wives, etc. When
the owners of the goods catch them with their belongings, they cut them into
pieces or throw them onto a rubbish heap, or hand them over to the king;
and then the king has various tortures inflicted upon them. And with the
breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination is to be expected for them.
Thus this entire danger &#8212; that pertaining to the here and now and that
pertaining to the afterlife &#8212; has come about rooted in contact. For this reason,
approach is to be understood as the danger in the case of the nutriment
contact.
<!--l. 58649--><p class="indent" >   The entire danger in the three realms of existence has come about by the
accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome kamma and is rooted in that
(accumulation). For this reason, accumulation is to be understood as the danger in
the nutriment mental volition.
<!--l. 58654--><p class="indent" >   And in whatever place rebirth-linking consciousness launches (the new existence),
in that same place it is reborn by seizing the rebirth-linking mentality-materiality.
When it is produced, all dangers are produced, for they are all rooted in it. For
this reason, launching is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment
consciousness.
<!--l. 58660--><p class="indent" >   The Four Similes
<!--l. 58662--><p class="indent" >   In regard to these nutriments with their dangers, for the sake of eliminating
desire for the nutriment physical food, the Fully Enlightened One taught the
simile of son&#8217;s flesh in the passage beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus, a
couple, a man and his wife,..." For the sake of eliminating desire for the
nutriment contact, he taught the simile of the flayed cow in the passage
beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a flayed cow..." For the sake of

eliminating desire for the nutriment mental volition, he taught the simile of the
charcoal pit in the passage beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was
a charcoal pit..." And for the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment
consciousness, he taught the simile of the man struck with three hundred
spears in the passage beginning thus: "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a thief, a
crook..."30
<!--l. 58677--><p class="indent" >   Therein, taking the essential meaning, there follows a brief interpretation of the
meaning. A couple, it is said, a man and his wife, took their son and set out on a
desert trail a hundred yojanas long,31 with only limited provisions. When they had
gone fifty yojanas their provisions ran out. Exhausted by hunger and thirst, they sat
down in some scanty shade. Then the man said to his wife: "My dear, for fifty
yojanas on all sides there is neither a village nor a town. Therefore, though a man
can do many kinds of work, such as plowing, guarding cattle, etc., it is not possible
for me to do that. Come, kill me. Eat half of my flesh, and having made the other
half into provisions for the journey, cross out of the desert together with our
son."
<!--l. 58690--><p class="indent" >   The wife said: "Dear husband, though a woman can do many kinds of work, such
as spinning thread, etc., it is not possible for me to do that. Come, kill me. Eat half
of my flesh, and having made the other half into provisions for the journey, cross out
of the desert together with our son."
<!--l. 58696--><p class="indent" >   Then the man said: "My dear, the death of the mother would mean the death of
two, for a young boy cannot live without his mother. But if we both live, then we can
beget another child again. Come now, let us kill our child, take his flesh, and cross
out of this desert."
<!--l. 58702--><p class="indent" >   Then the mother said to the son: "Dear, go to your father." He went, but the
father said: "For the sake of supporting this child I incurred much suffering through
such work as plowing, guarding cattle, etc. I cannot kill the boy. You kill your son."
Then he said: "Dear, go to your mother." But the mother said: "Longing
for a son I incurred much suffering by observing the cow-observance, the
dog-observance, praying to the gods, etc., not to speak of bearing him in my
womb.32 It is not possible for me to kill him." Then she said: "Dear, go to your
father."
<!--l. 58713--><p class="indent" >   The boy died from going back and forth between the father and the mother.
Seeing him dead, they wept, and having taken the flesh as described above, they
departed. Because that flesh of their son was repulsive to them for nine
reasons, it was not eaten for enjoyment nor for intoxication nor for making (the
body) strong and beautiful, but only for the purpose of crossing out of the
desert.
<!--l. 58720--><p class="indent" >   For what nine reasons was it repulsive? Because it was the flesh of their own
offspring, the flesh of a relative, the flesh of a son, the flesh of a dear son, the flesh of
a youngster, raw flesh, not beef, unsalted, unspiced. Therefore the bhikkhu who sees
the nutriment physical food thus, as similar to son&#8217;s flesh, eliminates the desire for
it.33
<!--l. 58727--><p class="indent" >   This, in the first place, is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of son&#8217;s
flesh.
<!--l. 58730--><p class="indent" >   Then, as regards the simile of the flayed cow: If a cow were stripped of its skin

from the neck to the hooves and then set free, whatever it would rest upon would
become a basis of pain for it, since it would be bitten by the small creatures living
there.34 So too, whatever physical basis or object contact stands upon as its support
becomes a basis for the felt pain originating from that basis or object.35 Therefore a
bhikkhu who sees the nutriment contact thus, as similar to a flayed cow, eliminates
the desire for it. This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the flayed
cow.
<!--l. 58740--><p class="indent" >   Then, as regards the simile of the charcoal pit:36 The three realms of
being are like a charcoal pit in the sense of a great burning heat (lit., a great
fever). Like the two men who grab hold (of a weaker man) by both his arms
and drag him towards it, is mental volition in the sense that it drags one
towards the realms of being. Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment
mental volition thus, as similar to a charcoal pit, eliminates the desire for
it. This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the charcoal
pit.
<!--l. 58749--><p class="indent" >   Then, as regards the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears:37 The
hundred spears that strike the man in the morning make a hundred wound openings
in his body, and without remaining inside they pierce through and fall on the other
side; and so with the other two hundred spears as well. Thus his whole body is cut
again and again by the spears which come without piercing him in a place where
another has already struck. There is no measuring the pain arisen in him
from even one of the wound openings, not to speak of three hundred wound
openings.
<!--l. 58759--><p class="indent" >   Therein, the time of the generation of the rebirth-linking consciousness is like the
time of being struck by a spear. The production of the aggregates is like the
production of the wound openings. The arising of the various kinds of suffering
rooted in the round (of existence) once the aggregates have been born is like the
arising of suffering on account of the wound openings.
<!--l. 58766--><p class="indent" >   Another method of interpretation (is as follows): The rebirth-linking
consciousness is like the thief. His mentality-materiality conditioned by consciousness
is like the wound openings created by the striking of the spears. The arising of
the various kinds of suffering by way of the thirty-two types of torture and
the eighty-nine types of diseases in regard to consciousness conditioned by
mentality-materiality &#8212; this should be regarded as like the arising of severe pain for
that man conditioned by the wound openings.
<!--l. 58775--><p class="indent" >   Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment consciousness thus, as similar to
one struck by three hundred spears, eliminates the desire for it. This is the
interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the man struck by three hundred
spears.
<!--l. 58780--><p class="indent" >   Full Understanding
<!--l. 58782--><p class="indent" >   Thus by eliminating desire in regard to these nutriments, he also fully
understands these four nutriments. When these have been fully understood, the
entire basis (for them) has also been fully understood. For this has been said by the
Blessed One (S.12:63/ii,99-100):
<!--l. 58787--><p class="indent" >   Bhikkhus, when the nutriment physical food has been fully understood, lust for
the five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully understood. When lust for the

five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully understood, there exists no
more any fetter bound by which the noble disciple might come back to this
world.
<!--l. 58793--><p class="indent" >   Bhikkhus, when the nutriment contact has been fully understood, the three
feelings have been fully understood. When the three feelings have been fully
understood, there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do, I say.
<!--l. 58798--><p class="indent" >   Bhikkhus, when the nutriment mental volition has been fully understood, the
three kinds of craving have been fully understood. When the three kinds of craving
have been fully understood, there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do, I
say.
<!--l. 58803--><p class="indent" >   Bhikkhus, when the nutriment consciousness has been fully understood,
mentality-materiality has been fully understood. When mentality-materiality has
been fully understood, there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do, I
say.
<!--l. 58808--><p class="indent" >   The Arising and Cessation of Nutriment
<!--l. 58810--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment (tanhasamudaya
aharasamudayo): This is the meaning: "With the arising of craving in the previous
(existence) the arising of the nutriments occurs at rebirth-linking (in this
existence)." How? Because at the moment of rebirth-linking there is the nutritive
essence produced among the thirty types of materiality that have arisen by
way of triple continuity.38 This is the kammically acquired physical food
as nutriment produced by craving as its condition. But the contact and
volition associated with the rebirth-linking consciousness, and that mind
or consciousness itself &#8212; these are the kammically acquired nutriments of
contact, mental volition and consciousness produced by craving as their
condition. Thus, in the first place, the arising of the nutriments at rebirth-linking
should be understood as occurring with the arising of craving in the previous
existence.
<!--l. 58825--><p class="indent" >   But because the nutriments that are kammically acquired and those that are not
kammically acquired have been discussed here combined, (the principle of) the
arising of nutriment with the arising of craving should be understood to apply also to
those that are not kammically acquired. For there is nutritive essence in the kinds of
materiality that are aroused by the eight types of consciousness accompanied by
greed;39 this is the nutriment physical food that is not kammically acquired yet is
produced by conascent craving as its condition. But the contact and volition
associated with the consciousness accompanied by greed, and that mind or
consciousness itself &#8212; these are the nutriments of contact, mental volition and
consciousness that are not kammically acquired yet are produced by craving as their
condition.
<!--l. 58838--><p class="indent" >   With the cessation of craving there is cessation of nutriment (tanhanirodha
aharanirodho): By this there is set forth the cessation of nutriment by the cessation
of the craving that had become the condition for both nutriment that is kammically
acquired and that which is not kammically acquired. The rest (should be
understood) by the method stated, but there is this difference. Here the four truths
are stated directly, and as here, so in all the following sections. Therefore
one who is unconfused in mind can deduce the truths throughout in what

follows.40
<!--l. 58847--><p class="indent" >   12. And in all the following sections the delimiting phrase In that way too, friends
(ettavata pi kho avuso) should be construed according to the principle that has been
expounded. Here, in the first place, this is the interpretation of it (in the present
context). "In that way too": what is meant is: "the attention and penetration
stated by way of the teaching concerning nutriment." The same method
throughout.
<!--l. 58855--><p class="indent" >   The Four Noble Truths
<!--l. 58857--><p class="indent" >   14. Now, delighting and rejoicing in the Elder&#8217;s words, after saying as before
"Good, friend," the bhikkhus asked a further question, and the Elder answered them
by another exposition. This method is found in all the following sections.
Therefore, from here onwards, we shall explain the meaning only of the particular
exposition he states in reply, without touching upon such words (as are already
explained).
<!--l. 58865--><p class="indent" >   15. In the brief exposition of this teaching, in the phrase (he) understands
suffering (dukkham pajanati), "suffering" is the truth of suffering. But regarding the
detailed exposition, whatever needs to be said has all been said already in the
Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Truths (XVI,13-104).
<!--l. 58871--><p class="indent" >   Aging and Death
<!--l. 58873--><p class="indent" >   21. From here onwards the teaching is given by way of dependent arising (paticca
samuppada).
<!--l. 58876--><p class="indent" >   22. Therein, in the section on aging and death, firstly as to the term their (tesam
tesam) &#8212; this should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many
kinds of beings. For if one were to state (the aging of individuals such as) the aging of
Devadatta, the aging of Somadatta, etc., one would never come to an end of beings.
But there is no being not included by this term "their."41 Therefore it was said
above: "This should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many
kinds of beings."
<!--l. 58886--><p class="indent" >   In the various (tamhi tamhi): This is a collective designation for the many
(different) orders by way of destiny and birth. Orders of beings (sattanikaye): an
indication of the nature of what is designated by the collective designation.
<!--l. 58891--><p class="indent" >   Aging, old age (jara jiranata), etc.: As regards these, "aging" is the description of
the nature; "old age" is the description of the aspect; "brokenness," etc., are
descriptions of the function with respect to the passage of time; and the last two
terms are descriptions of the normal (process). For this is indicated as to nature by
this term aging (jara); hence this is a description of its nature. It is indicated as to
aspect by this term old age (jiranata); hence this is a description of its aspect.
Brokenness (khandicca): by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the
broken state of teeth and nails on account of the passage of time. Grayness (palicca):
by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the head hairs and body hairs to
turn gray. Wrinkling (valittacata): by this it is indicated as to the wrinkled state of
the skin after the withering of the flesh. Hence the three terms beginning
with brokenness are descriptions of function with respect to the passage
of time. By these evident aging is shown, which becomes evident by the
showing of these alterations. For just as the course taken by water or wind
or fire is evident from the damaged and broken state, or the burnt state,

of the grass and trees, etc., and yet the course that has been taken is not
the water, etc., itself, so too the course taken by aging is evident through
brokenness of teeth, etc., and it is apprehended by opening the eyes, but the
brokenness, etc., themselves are not aging, nor is aging cognizable by the
eye.
<!--l. 58915--><p class="indent" >   Decline of life, weakness of faculties (ayuno samhani indriyanam paripako): By
these terms it is indicated by means of the normal (process) known as the exhaustion
of the life-span and the weakening of the eye faculty, etc., that has become manifest
with the passage of time. Hence these last two are to be understood as descriptions of
its normal (process).
<!--l. 58921--><p class="indent" >   Therein, because the life-span of one who has reached aging is dwindling, aging is
called "decline of life" as a metaphor (for the cause stated in terms) of its effect. And
because the eye faculty, etc. &#8212; which at the time of youth were quite clear and
could easily grasp even subtle objects &#8212; become deficient, obscure, unable to
grasp even gross objects when one has reached old age, therefore it is called
"weakness of faculties" also as a metaphor (for the cause stated in terms) of its
effect.
<!--l. 58931--><p class="indent" >   This aging, thus described, is all of two kinds, evident and concealed. Therein, the
aging of material phenomena, shown by brokenness, etc., is called evident aging
(pakatajara). But in the case of immaterial phenomena, because their alteration in
such a way is not visible, their aging is called concealed aging (paticchannajara).
Therein, the brokenness that is seen is simply color (vanna) because of the ease of
comprehending such things as the teeth, etc. Having seen this with the eye and
reflected on it with the mind door, one knows aging thus: "These teeth have been
afflicted by aging," just as one knows the existence of water below when one
has noticed the heads of cows, etc., bound to the place where the water is
located.
<!--l. 58943--><p class="indent" >   Again, aging is twofold thus: as continuous and as discrete. Therein, continuous
aging (avicijara) is the aging of such things as gems, gold, silver, coral, the sun and
moon, etc.; it is so called because of the difficulty of perceiving in such things
distinct changes in color, etc., at regular intervals, as we can in the case
of living beings passing through the decade of childhood, etc., and in the
case of vegetation (lit. non-breathing things) such as flowers, fruits, buds,
etc. The meaning is: aging that progresses without interval. Discrete aging
(savicijara) is the aging of the things other than those, i.e., of the aforesaid things
(living beings and vegetation); it is so called because it is easy to perceive in
them distinct changes in color, etc., at regular intervals. So it should be
understood.
<!--l. 58956--><p class="indent" >   Following this (in the definition of death) the term their (tesam tesam) should be
understood by the method stated above (in the definition of aging). Then, in the
expression passing, passing away, etc., passing (cuti) is said by way of what has the
nature to pass away; this is a collective designation (applying) to one-, four-, and
five-aggregate (existence). Passing away (cavanata) is the indication of the
characteristic by a word expressing the abstract state. Dissolution (bheda) is an
indication of the occurrence of the breaking up of the aggregates (at the time) of
passing. Disappearance (antaradhana) is an indication of the absence of any manner

of persistence of the aggregates (at the time) of passing, as they are broken like a
broken pot.
<!--l. 58968--><p class="indent" >   Dying (maccu marana): death which is called dying. By this he rejects the idea of
death as complete annihilation. Completion of time (kalakiriya): time is the
destroyer, and this (completion of time) is its activity. By this he explains death in
conventional terminology.
<!--l. 58973--><p class="indent" >   Now, to explain death in (terms valid in) the ultimate sense, he next says
the dissolution of the aggregates (khandhanam bhedo), etc.42 For in the
ultimate sense it is only the aggregates that break up; it is not any so called
being that dies. But when the aggregates are breaking up convention says "a
being is dying," and when they have broken up convention says "(he is)
dead."
<!--l. 58981--><p class="indent" >   Here the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of four- [and five-]
constituent being; the laying down of the body (kalevarassa nikkhepo) by way of
one-constituent being.43 Or alternatively, the dissolution of the aggregates is said by
way of four-constituent being; the laying down of the body should be understood by
way of the other two (i.e., one- and five-constituent being). Why? Because of the
existence of the body, that is, the material body, in those two realms of being. Or
else, because in the realm of the Four Great Kings, etc., the aggregates simply break
up and they do not lay anything down, the dissolution of the aggregates is said with
reference to them.44 The laying down of the body occurs among human
beings, etc. And here, because it is the cause for the laying down of the body,
death is called the laying down of the body. Thus the meaning should be
understood.
<!--l. 58995--><p class="indent" >   So this aging and this death are what is called aging and death (iti ayan ca jara
idan ca maranam idam vuccat&#8217;avuso jaramaranam): this is spoken of as "aging and
death" by combining the two into one.
<!--l. 59000--><p class="indent" >   Birth
<!--l. 59002--><p class="indent" >   26. In the section on birth, in regard to the phrase birth,... their coming to birth,
etc., birth (jati) is in the sense of being born; this is stated with reference to those
(conceived) with incomplete sense bases. Coming to birth (sanjati) is in the sense of
the act of coming to birth; this is stated with reference to those (conceived) with
already complete sense bases. Precipitation (or descent, okkanti) is in the sense of
being precipitated (descending). This is stated with reference to those born from the
egg and from the womb, for they take rebirth-linking as though descending and
entering the egg shell or the placenta. Generation (abhinibbatti) is in the sense of
being generated. This is stated with reference to those born from moisture or
those of spontaneous birth, for these are generated as soon as they become
manifest.
<!--l. 59016--><p class="indent" >   Now comes the exposition in (terms valid in) the ultimate sense. Manifestation
(patubhava) is the arising. Of the aggregates (khandhanam) is to be understood as
(the arising) of one aggregate in the one-constituent realm of being, of four
aggregates in four-constituent realms, and of five aggregates in five-constituent
realms. Obtaining (patilabha) is the manifestation in continuity. The bases
(ayatananam) should be understood as comprising the sense bases arising (at
conception) in this or that realm. For when the sense bases become manifest, then

they are said to be obtained.
<!--l. 59026--><p class="indent" >   This is called birth (ayam vuccat&#8217;avuso jati): by this phrase he comes to the
conclusion on birth taught in both conventional terms and in the ultimate
sense.
<!--l. 59030--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of being (bhavasamudaya): but here one should understand
kammically active being as the condition for birth. The rest by the method
stated.
<!--l. 59034--><p class="indent" >   Being
<!--l. 59036--><p class="indent" >   30. In the section on being, sense-sphere being (kamabhava) is kammically active
being and resultant being. Therein, kammically active being (kammabhava) is
kamma itself that leads to sense-sphere being. For that is called "being"
as a designation of the cause in terms of its effect, because it is the cause
for resultant being, as when it is said: "The arising of Buddhas is bliss"
and "The accumulation of evil is painful" (Dhp. 194, 117). Resultant being
(upapattibhava) is the group of kammically acquired aggregates produced
by that kamma. For that is called "being" because it exists there. Thus
this kamma and this result are both spoken of conjointly as "sense-sphere
being." The same method applies to fine-material being and immaterial being
(ruparupabhava).
<!--l. 59050--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of clinging (upadanasamudaya): But here clinging is a condition
for wholesome kammically active being only by way of decisive support; it is a
condition for unwholesome kammically active being by way of both decisive support
and conascence.45 For all resultant being it is a condition only by way of decisive
support. The rest by the method stated.
<!--l. 59057--><p class="indent" >   Clinging
<!--l. 59059--><p class="indent" >   34. In the section on clinging, in regard to the phrase "clinging to sense
pleasures," etc., clinging to sense pleasures (kamupadana) is analyzed thus: by this
one clings to the object of sensual pleasure, or this itself clings to it. Or alternatively:
that is a sensual pleasure and it is clinging, thus it is clinging to sensual pleasure. It
is firm grasping (dalhagahana) that is called clinging. For here the prefix upa has the
sense of firmness. This is a designation for the lust for the five cords of sensual
pleasure. This is the brief account here. The detailed account should be
understood by the method stated thus: "Therein, what is clinging to sensual
pleasures? The sensual desire in regard to sensual pleasures," etc. (Dhs. Section
1214).
<!--l. 59072--><p class="indent" >   So too, that is a view and clinging, thus it is clinging to views (ditthupadana). Or
alternatively: it clings to a view, or by this they cling to a view. For the subsequent
view clings to the previous view and thereby they cling to the view. As it is said:
"Self and the world are eternal; only this is true, anything else is false," etc.
(M.102/ii, 233). This is a designation for the whole field of (wrong) views except
clinging to rituals and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self.46 This is the
brief account here. The detailed account should be understood by the method stated
thus: "Therein, what is clinging to views? There is nothing given," etc. (Dhs. Section
1215).
<!--l. 59084--><p class="indent" >   So too, by this they cling to rituals and observances, or this itself clings to
them, or that is a ritual and observance and clinging, thus it is clinging to

rituals and observances (silabbatupadana). For when one adheres to the idea
that the cow ritual or cow observance brings purification, that itself is a
clinging.47 This is the brief account here. The detailed account should be
understood by the method stated thus: "Therein, what is clinging to rituals and
observances? (The idea) of recluses and brahmans outside here (i.e., outside the
Buddha&#8217;s dispensation) that purity (is achieved) by rules," etc. (Dhs. Section
1216).
<!--l. 59095--><p class="indent" >   Now they assert in terms of this, thus it is a doctrine. By this they cling, thus it is
clinging. What do they assert? Or what do they cling to? Self. The clinging to a
doctrine about a self is the clinging to a doctrine of self (attavadupadana). Or
alternatively: by this a mere doctrine of self is clung to as self, thus it is clinging to a
doctrine of self. This is a designation for personality view with its twenty cases. This
is the brief account here. The detailed account should be understood by the
method stated thus: "Therein, what is clinging to a doctrine of self? Here, the
uninstructed worldling who has no regard for noble ones," etc. (Dhs. Section
1217).
<!--l. 59107--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of craving (tanhasamudaya): here, craving is a condition for
clinging to sensual pleasures either by way of decisive support or by way of
proximity, contiguity, absence, disappearance and repetition.48 But for the rest
(it is a condition) by way of conascence, etc., too. The rest by the method
stated.
<!--l. 59113--><p class="indent" >   Craving
<!--l. 59115--><p class="indent" >   38. In the section on craving, craving for forms... craving for mind-objects
(rupatanha... dhammatanha): these are names for the kinds of craving which occur in
the course of a javana cognitive process (javanavithi) in the eye door, etc. Like a
name derived from the father, such as Setthiputta ("merchant&#8217;s son") or
Brahmanaputta ("brahman&#8217;s son"), their names are derived from the object, which is
similar to the father [as being the cause (hetu) of it only, not as is the case with
"eye-contact," which is like a name derived from the mother in that (the eye like the
mother in relation to her son) is a cause by its nature as a physical support
(nissayabhava)].
<!--l. 59127--><p class="indent" >   And here, craving for forms is craving that has forms as its object, craving in
regard to forms. When this occurs by finding gratification in visible forms through its
nature as sensual lust, it is craving for sensual pleasure (kamatanha). When it occurs
by finding gratification in visible forms, thinking "Form is permanent, lasting,
eternal," through its nature as lust accompanied by the eternalist view, then it is
craving for being (bhavatanha). When it occurs by finding gratification in visible
form, thinking "Form is annihilated, destroyed, and does not exist after death,"
through its nature as lust accompanied by the annihilationist view, then it is craving
for non-being (vibhavatanha). Thus it is threefold. And as craving for form, so too
craving for sound, etc., (are each threefold too). Thus there are eighteen modes of
craving. These eighteen in respect of internal visible form, etc., and in respect
of external visible form, etc., come to thirty-six. So thirty-six in the past,
thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six at present make up a hundred and
eight.
<!--l. 59145--><p class="indent" >   Or there are eighteen based on internal form, etc., thus: "On account of the

internal there is (the notion) &#8217;I am,&#8217; there is (the notion) &#8217;I am such and such,&#8217; "
and so on; and there are eighteen based on external form, etc., thus: "On
account of the external there is (the notion) &#8217;I am,&#8217; there is (the notion) &#8217;I
am such and such,&#8217; " and so on. Thus there are thirty-six. So thirty-six in
the past, thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six at present make up thus
the hundred and eight modes of craving (tanhavicaritani; see A. 4:199/ii,
212).
<!--l. 59155--><p class="indent" >   Again, when a classification is made, they reduce to only six classes of craving &#8212;
in terms of their objects, forms and the rest &#8212; and to only three types of craving &#8212;
craving for sensual pleasure and the rest. Thus:
<!--l. 59160--><p class="indent" >   Craving should be known by the wise Through description and when
described In detail; it (should be known) again Through classification of the
detail.
<!--l. 59164--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of feeling there is the arising of craving (vedanasamudaya
tanhasamudayo): But here the word "feeling" is intended as resultant feeling.49 How
is that the condition for craving in respect of the six sense doors? Because of its
ability to produce gratification. For it is through the gratification in pleasant feeling
that beings become enamored of that feeling, and after arousing craving for feeling
and being seized by lust for feeling, they long only for a desirable visible
form in the eye door. And on getting it, they find gratification in it, and
they honor painters, etc., who provide such objects. Likewise, they long
only for a desirable sound, etc., in the ear door, etc. And on getting it, they
find gratification in it, and they honor musicians, perfume makers, cooks,
spinners and the teachers of the various crafts. Like what? Like those who,
being enamored of a child, out of love for the child honor the wet-nurse and
give her suitable ghee, milk, etc., to eat and drink. The rest by the method
stated.
<!--l. 59181--><p class="indent" >   Feeling
<!--l. 59183--><p class="indent" >   42. In the section on feeling, classes of feeling (vedanakaya) means groups of feeling.
Feeling born of eye-contact... feeling born of mind-contact (cakkhusamphassaja
vedana... manosamphassaja vedana): because of what has come down in the
Vibhanga thus: "There is feeling born of eye-contact that is wholesome, that is
unwholesome, that is indeterminate" (Vibh. 15), the wholesome, unwholesome and
indeterminate feelings that occur in the eye door, etc., are named after the physical
base, which is similar to a mother, just as some are named after their mother, such
as "Sariputta (Lady Sari&#8217;s son)," "Mantaniputta (Lady Mantani&#8217;s son),"
etc.
<!--l. 59195--><p class="indent" >   But the word meaning here is this: feeling born of eye-contact (cakkhusamphassaja
vedana) is feeling that is born with eye-contact as the cause. The same method
throughout. This, in the first place, is the all-inclusive explanation. But by way of
resultant, in the eye-door there are two eye-consciousnesses, two mind elements,
three mind-consciousness elements; feeling should be understood as what
is associated with these.50 This method also applies in the ear door, etc.
In the mind door, (feeling) is associated only with the mind-consciousness
elements.
<!--l. 59204--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of contact (phassasamudaya): But here the arising in the five

doors of the feelings that have the five physical bases (as their support) occurs with
the arising of the conascent eye-contact. For the rest, eye-contact, etc., are conditions
by way of decisive support. In the mind door, the arising of feelings (on the occasion)
of registration and of the doorless feelings (on the occasions) of rebirth-linking,
life-continuum and death occurs with the arising of the conascent mind-contact.51
The rest by the method stated.
<!--l. 59213--><p class="indent" >   Contact
<!--l. 59215--><p class="indent" >   46. In the section on contact, eye-contact (cakkhusamphassa) is contact in the
eye. The same method throughout. Eye-contact... body-contact (cakkhusamphasso...
kayasamphasso): up to this point ten kinds of contact have been stated, namely, the
wholesome- and unwholesome-resultants having the five physical bases (as their
support). Mind-contact (manosamphassa): by this (he indicates) the remaining
twenty-two kinds of contact associated with the mundane resultant (types of
consciousness).52
<!--l. 59223--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of the sixfold base (salayatanasamudaya): The arising of this
sixfold contact should be understood to occur by way of the arising of the six bases
beginning with the eye-base. The rest by the method stated.
<!--l. 59228--><p class="indent" >   The Sixfold Base
<!--l. 59230--><p class="indent" >   50. In the section on the sixfold base, as regards the eye-base (cakkhayatana),
etc., whatever should be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the
Description of the Aggregates and in the Description of the Bases (XIV, 37-52; XV,
1-16).
<!--l. 59235--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of mentality-materiality (namarupasamudaya): But here the
arising of the sixfold base should be understood to occur from the arising of
mentality-materiality according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the
Description of Dependent Arising, as to which mentality, which materiality, and
which mentality-materiality are a condition for which base (XVII, 206-219).
<!--l. 59242--><p class="indent" >   Mentality-Materiality
<!--l. 59244--><p class="indent" >   54. In the section on mentality-materiality, mentality (nama) has the
characteristic of bending (namana); materiality (rupa) has the characteristic
of being molested (ruppana).53 In the detailed section, however, feeling
(vedana) is to be understood as the feeling aggregate, perception (sa章a)
as the perception aggregate, and volition, contact and attention (cetana
phasso manasikaro) as the formations aggregate. While it is certainly the
case that other states are included in the formations aggregate, still these
three are found in all classes of consciousness, even the weakest. That is
why the formations aggregate is here pointed out only by means of these
three.
<!--l. 59255--><p class="indent" >   The four great elements (cattari mahabhutani): this is a designation for the four
&#8212; earth, water, fire and air. The reason why these are called "great elements," and
other determinations concerning them, are all stated in the Visuddhimagga in the
Description of the Materiality Aggregate.54
<!--l. 59261--><p class="indent" >   Derived from the four great elements (catunnan ca mahabhutanam upadaya):
derived from (upadaya) = having clung to (upadayitva); "having grasped" is the
meaning. Some also say "depending upon" (nissaya). And here the reading is
completed by adding the word "existing" (vattamanam). The Pali uses the genitive

(in the term for the elements) in the sense of a group. Hence the meaning here should
be understood thus: the materiality that exists derived from the group of the four
great elements.
<!--l. 59270--><p class="indent" >   Thus materiality taken altogether is to be understood as consisting of all the
following: the four great elements beginning with the earth element, and the
materiality that exists derived from the four great elements, stated in the
canonical Abhidhamma to be of twenty-three kinds by analysis into the eye-base,
etc.55
<!--l. 59276--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of consciousness (vi章anasamudaya): But here the arising of
mentality-materiality should be understood to occur with the arising of consciousness
according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of
Dependent Arising, as to which consciousness is a condition for which mentality, for
which materiality, and for which mentality-materiality (XVII, 186-202). The rest by
the method stated.
<!--l. 59284--><p class="indent" >   Consciousness
<!--l. 59286--><p class="indent" >   58. In the section on consciousness, eye-consciousness (cakkhuvi章ana) is
consciousness in the eye or consciousness born from the eye. So also with ear-, nose-,
tongue- and body-consciousness. But with the other one, i.e., mind-consciousness
(manovi章ana), mind itself is consciousness. This is a designation for the resultant
consciousness of the three (mundane) planes of existence except for the two groups of
fivefold consciousness.56
<!--l. 59294--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of formations (sankharasamudaya): But here the arising of
consciousness should be understood to occur with the arising of formations according
to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga, as to which formation is a condition for
which consciousness (XVII, 175-185).
<!--l. 59299--><p class="indent" >   Formations
<!--l. 59301--><p class="indent" >   62. In the section on formations, a formation (sankhara) has the characteristic of
forming (abhisankharanalakkhana). But in the detailed section, the bodily formation
(kayasankhara) is a formation that proceeds from the body. This is a designation for
the twenty kinds of bodily volition &#8212; the eight sense-sphere wholesome
and twelve unwholesome &#8212; that occur by way of activation in the bodily
door.57 The verbal formation (vacisankhara) is a formation that proceeds
from speech. This is a designation for the (same) twenty kinds of verbal
volition that occur by way of breaking into speech in the door of speech. The
mental formation (cittasankhara) is a formation that proceeds from the
mind. This is a designation for the twenty-nine kinds of mental volition
&#8212; the mundane wholesome and unwholesome &#8212; that occur in one sitting
alone in thought, and which do not cause activation of the bodily and verbal
doors.58
<!--l. 59316--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of ignorance (avijjasamudaya): But here ignorance should be
understood as a condition for the wholesome by way of decisive support and for
the unwholesome by way of conascence as well. The rest by the method
stated.
<!--l. 59321--><p class="indent" >   Ignorance
<!--l. 59323--><p class="indent" >   66. In the section on ignorance, not knowing about suffering (dukkhe a章anam)
means not knowing about the truth of suffering. This is a designation for delusion

(moha). The same method with respect to "not knowing about the origin of
suffering," and so on.
<!--l. 59328--><p class="indent" >   Herein, not knowing about suffering should be understood in four ways: as to
containment (antogadhato), as to physical basis (vatthuto), as to object
(arammanato), and as to concealment (paticchadanato). Thus, because of
being included in the truth of suffering, it ("not knowing" or ignorance) is
contained in suffering; and the truth of suffering is its physical basis by being its
support condition; and (the truth of suffering) is its object by being its object
condition; and it conceals the truth of suffering by preventing the penetration of
its real characteristic and by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to
it.
<!--l. 59339--><p class="indent" >   Not knowing about the origin (of suffering) should be understood in three ways:
as to physical basis, as to object, and as to concealment. And not knowing about
cessation and the way (to cessation) should be understood in one way only: as to
concealment. For non-knowledge only conceals cessation and the way by preventing
the penetration of their real characteristics and by not allowing knowledge to occur
in regard to them. But it is not contained in them because it is not included in this
pair of truths. And these two truths are not its physical basis because they are not
conascent. Nor are they its object because of its non-occurrence on account of them.
For the last pair of truths are difficult to see because of their profundity, and
non-knowledge, which is blind, does not occur there. But the first (pair of truths) is
profound in the sense of opposition because of the difficulty in seeing the
characteristic of their intrinsic nature; it occurs there by way of obsession by the
perversions.
<!--l. 59355--><p class="indent" >   Furthermore: About suffering (dukkhe): to this extent ignorance is indicated as to
inclusion, as to physical basis, as to object, and as to function. About the origin of
suffering (dukkhasamudaye): to this extent, as to basis, as to object, and as to
function. About the cessation of suffering (dukkhanirodhe) and about the way
leading to the cessation of suffering (dukkhanirodhagaminiya patipadaya):
to this extent, as to function. But without distinction, (in each instance)
ignorance is described in terms of its intrinsic nature by the phrase "not
knowing."
<!--l. 59365--><p class="indent" >   With the arising of the taints (asavasamudaya): But here the taint of sensual
desire and the taint of being are conditions for ignorance by way of conascence, etc.;
the taint of ignorance, only by way of decisive support. And here the ignorance that
had arisen previously should be understood as the taint of ignorance. That is a
decisive support condition for the ignorance that arises subsequently. The rest by the
method stated.
<!--l. 59373--><p class="indent" >   The Taints
<!--l. 59375--><p class="indent" >   70. In the section on the taints, with the arising of ignorance (avijjasamudaya):
Here ignorance is a condition for the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being by
way of decisive support, etc.; (it is a condition) for the taint of ignorance only by way
of decisive support. And here the ignorance that arises subsequently should be
understood as the taint of ignorance. The previously arisen ignorance itself becomes a
decisive support condition for the subsequently arisen taint of ignorance. The rest by
the aforesaid method.

<!--l. 59384--><p class="indent" >   This section is stated by way of showing the condition for the ignorance which
heads the factors of dependent arising. Stated thus, the undiscoverability
(anamataggata) of any beginning of samsara is established. How? Because
with the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance, and with
the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taints. Thus the taints
are a condition for ignorance, and ignorance is a condition for the taints.
Having shown this, (it follows that) no first point of ignorance is manifest, and
because none is manifest the undiscoverability of any beginning of samsara is
proven.59
<!--l. 59394--><p class="indent" >   Conclusion
<!--l. 59396--><p class="indent" >   Thus in all this sutta sixteen sections have been stated: the section on the courses
of kamma, the section on nutriment, the section on suffering, and the sections on
aging and death, birth, being, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the sixfold
base, mentality-materiality, consciousness, formations, ignorance and the
taints.
<!--l. 59402--><p class="indent" >   As to these, in each individual section there is a twofold analysis &#8212; in brief and in
detail &#8212; amounting to thirty-two cases. Thus in this sutta, in these thirty-two cases,
the Four (Noble) Truths are expounded. Among these, in the sixteen cases stated in
detail, arahantship is expounded.
<!--l. 59408--><p class="indent" >   But according to the opinion of the Elder, the four truths and the four paths are
expounded in the thirty-two cases.60 Thus in the entire Word of the Buddha
comprised in the five great Nikayas, there is no sutta except for this Discourse on
Right View where the Four (Noble) Truths are explained thirty-two times and where
arahantship is explained thirty-two times.
<!--l. 59415--><p class="indent" >   That is what the Venerable Sariputta said (idam avoc&#8217;ayasma Sariputto): The
Venerable Sariputta spoke this Discourse on Right View, having adorned it with
sixty-four divisions &#8212; thirty-two expositions of the four truths and thirty-two
expositions of arahantship. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the
Venerable Sariputta&#8217;s words.
<!--l. 59422--><p class="indent" >   In the Papa刃asudani, the Commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya, the Explanation
of the Discourse on Right View is concluded.
<!--l. 59425--><p class="indent" >   Notes
<!--l. 59427--><p class="indent" >   1.The term sammaditthi is ordinarily used to mean simply a state, the path factor
of right view. Here, however, the Pali expression is used as a masculine noun to
mean, in the first instance, a person possessing right view; hence it has been rendered
"one of right view." The commentator contrasts this unusual usage of the term with
the more common usage where sammaditthi signifies a state (dhamma), that is,
the path factor rather than the individual endowed with that state.2.The
knowledge of kamma as one&#8217;s own (kammassakata人na) is often expressed in
the Suttas thus: "I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma, I
spring from my kamma, I am bound to my kamma, I have kamma as my
refuge. Whatever kamma I perform, good or bad, of that I am the heir." In
short, it is knowledge of the moral efficacy of action, of the fact that one&#8217;s
willed deeds fashion one&#8217;s destiny. Knowledge in conformity with the truths
(saccanulomika人na) is conceptual knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, accompanied
by understanding and acceptance of them.3.The understanding or wisdom (pa章a)

connected with the paths and fruits is supramundane because its object is the
supramundane dhamma, Nibbana, and because it leads to the overcoming of the
world.4.A disciple in higher training (sekha) is one at any of the three lower
levels of sanctity &#8212; a stream-enterer, once-returner, or non-returner &#8212; or
one who has reached their respective paths. His right view is said to be
fixed in destiny (niyata) because it necessarily leads to final liberation.5.The
"one beyond training" (asekha) is the arahant, so called because he has
completed the threefold training in virtue, concentration and wisdom.6.The
ninefold supramundane Dhamma: the four paths, the four fruitions, and
Nibbana.7.The interpretation of "the bhikkhus" and "the Elder" is offered by
Sub. Cy., which also presents an alternative interpretation, based on the
commentary to the Vatthupama Sutta (M.7) according to which the bhikkhus are
the pupils of the Elder Mahasangharakkhita and "the Elder" is the Elder
Mahasangharakkhita.8.See commentary to the third parajika offence.9.See
commentary to the second parajika offence.10.The meaning of several of these terms,
obscure in the original Pali, has been elaborated with the aid of the Sub.
Cy.11.Consent (adhivasana) is included to cover the case where one of the partners is
initially an unwilling victim of another&#8217;s assault, but during the course of
union consents to the act and thereby becomes a participant.12.These are
references to the two great classics of Hindu India, the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana.13.Wrong views of fixed destiny (niyata micchaditthi) are views
which deny the moral efficacy of action or which tend to undermine the
foundations of morality. For the most common examples, see D.2/i, 52-56, and
M.76/i, 515-18.14.The chief factor in the first seven courses of kamma is
volition; the other three courses are identical with the mental factors of
greed, hatred and wrong view, which are associated with volition in the
states of consciousness in which they arise.15.This refers to the Abhidhamma
classification of consciousness, according to which wholesome sense-sphere
consciousness is of eight types, four associated with knowledge, four dissociated
from knowledge. The abstinences, according to the Abhidhamma, occur
in sense-sphere consciousness only one at a time on occasions when one
deliberately abstains from some wrong. In supramundane consciousness all
three abstinences &#8212; right speech, right action and right livelihood &#8212; occur
together simultaneously.16.Right view is synonymous with the mental factor of
wisdom (pa章a) or non-delusion (amoha); it is always accompanied by the
other two wholesome roots, though the latter do not necessarily occur in
conjunction with right view.17.Literally, or in the strict sense (nippariyayena), only
covetousness and greed, being synonyms of craving (tanha), count as the origin of
suffering. But in a looser or figurative manner of exposition (pariyayena) all
the roots are the truth of the origin, since as roots of kamma they help to
sustain the round of rebirth and suffering.18.The guideline of conversion
(avattahara) is one of the methods of deduction in the exegetical guide, the
Nettippakarana. According to this guideline, an expositor of a sutta is to extract
from a particular text a standard doctrinal concept belonging to a dichotomy, and
then taking this concept as a basis, he is to show that the other member
of the dichotomy is also implied by the passage under consideration, and

therefore "turns up" when the first member is mentioned.19.The path of
non-return (anagamimagga) is stated because this path eradicates all sensual lust
and aversion.20.The path of arahantship is implied by the eradication of
conceit and ignorance and by the arousing of true knowledge.21.The verb
aharati normally means "to bring," but here it is rendered as "nourish"
to underscore its connection with ahara, nutriment.22.On the four yoni or
modes of generation, see M.12/i, 73.23.According to the Abhidhamma, the
nutriment proper is the material phenomenon called nutritive essence (oja),
while the solid food ingested is the mere "basis" (vatthu) of the nutritive
essence.24.The point is that while in conventional terms food substances are
distinguished as gross or subtle, this distinction is made in terms of the physical
base only. The Abhidhamma classifies nutritive essence as subtle materiality
(sukhumarupa); it contrasts with gross materiality (olarikarupa), which includes
only the five sense organs and their objects.25.This is the highest realm
among the sense-sphere heavens. Above this come the Brahma realms, where
physical nutriment is non-existent.26.This is the simplest kind of material
group (rupakalapa) recognized by the Abhidhamma theory of matter. It
consists of the four primary elements, along with color, smell, taste, and
nutritive essence. All the more complex material groups also contain these eight
phenomena as their foundation. Material groups in a living organism require an
input of nutriment in order to endure in continuity.27.Conascence condition
(sahajatapaccaya) is the condition whereby the conditioning state contributes to the
arising or maintenance of another state, the conditionally arisen state, when
the latter arises simultaneously with itself. Consciousness is a conascence
condition for the three other mental aggregates &#8212; feeling, perception and mental
formations &#8212; both at rebirth and during the course of life. At rebirth it is also
a conascence condition for the "triple continuity," i.e., the three material
decads of body-sensitivity, sexual determination and the heart-base. Each
of these consists of the above-mentioned eight material units along with
physical life and, as the tenth factor, the material phenomenon after which it is
named.28.Kammically acquired materiality (upadinnarupa) is matter that
is born of kamma. It includes the physical sense faculties, the life faculty,
masculinity, femininity, and the coexisting material phenomena in the same
group. Though such types of matter are produced by kamma rather than by
nutriment, they require nutriment to sustain them in continuity.29.The Lakkhana
Samyutta (S.19/ii, 254-62) describes the torments experienced by beings in the
realm of the petas or "afflicted spirits."30.These similes are taken from the
Puttamamsa Sutta, the Discourse on Son&#8217;s Flesh (S.12:63/ii, 97-100). See
Nyanaponika Thera, The Four Nutriments of Life (BPS Wheel No. 104/105, 1967),
pp. 19-40, for the sutta along with its commentary.31.A yojana is about
seven miles.32.The cow-observance and the dog-observance are forms of
self-mortification which ascetics of the Buddha&#8217;s time practiced in the hope of
purification; see M.57/i, 387. Apparently, women also observed them for short
periods in the hope they would make them fertile.33.The commentary to the
Puttamamsa Sutta develops this analogy in greater detail than the present
commentary.34.The sutta elaborates as follows: If the cow stands, the creatures in the

air attack it; if it leans against a wall, the creatures in the wall attack it;
if it lies down, the creatures in the ground attack it; if it enters a pool of
water, the creatures in the water attack it.35.Contact arises from the coming
together of an object, a physical basis or sense faculty (vatthu), and the
corresponding type of consciousness.36.The simile as given in the sutta is this: Two
strong men grab hold of a weaker man by both arms and drag him towards a
blazing charcoal pit. He wriggles and struggles to get free because he knows
that if he is thrown into the pit, he will meet death or deadly pain.37.The
king&#8217;s men arrest a thief and bring him before the king. The king orders him
struck with a hundred spears in the morning, another hundred at noon, and a
third hundred in the evening. The man survives but experiences deadly
pain.38.See note 27.39.The eight types of consciousness accompanied by
greed are distinguished by the presence or absence of wrong view, by their
accompanying feeling which may be pleasant or neutral, and by whether they
are spontaneous or prompted.40.The principle of the Four Noble Truths
can be discerned in the format of the exposition: a particular item X, the
arising of X, the cessation of X, and the way to the cessation of X.41.In Pali
the repetition tesam tesam, lit. "of them, of them," is understood to imply
complete inclusiveness. The same applies to tamhi tamhi, "in that, in that,"
just below.42.Whereas the previous definitions were framed in conventional
terminology, those valid in the ultimate sense (paramatthato) define their
subject solely in terms of "ultimate realities" such as aggregates and sense
bases.43.The various realms of existence are analyzed as threefold on the basis
of the number of aggregates existing there. One-constituent being is the
non-percipient realm (asannibhumi), which includes only the aggregate of
material form. Four-constituent being is the four immaterial realms, which
contain the four mental aggregates but not the aggregate of material form.
Five-constituent being comprises all other realms, in which all five aggregates are
present.44.It seems that in the sense-sphere heavens, at death the beings simply
dissipate into thin air, without leaving behind any corpse.45.Decisive support
condition (upanissayapaccaya) and conascence condition (sahajatapaccaya) are
the two chief conditions among the twenty-four conditions of the Patthana
or Abhidhammic system of conditional relations. Decisive support holds
between a conditioning state and a conditioned state that it helps to arise
across an interval of time. Conascence condition holds between a conditioning
state and a conditioned state that arise simultaneously. See also note 27
above.46.Clinging to rituals and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
are both types of wrong view, but as they are enumerated as individual
kinds of clinging in their own right, they are not included under clinging to
views.47.See above, note 32.48.These are conditional relations that hold between
successive mind-moments in the javana phase of a single cognitive process
(cittavithi).49.Resultant feeling alone is intended here because this is an exposition of
the round of existence, and in the formula of dependent arising the factors from
consciousness through feeling are classified as the resultant phase of the
round.50.The two eye-consciousness elements are the wholesome-resultant
and the unwholesome-resultant; the two resultant mind elements are the

wholesome-resultant and the unwholesome-resultant receiving consciousness
(sampaticchanacitta); the three resultant mind-consciousness elements are
three types of investigating consciousness (santiranacitta).51.The registration
consciousness (tadarammanacitta) is a resultant type of consciousness that occurs
through any of the sense doors. Its function is to register the datum that had
been the object of the preceding javana series. The rebirth, life-continuum
(bhavanga) and death consciousnesses are resultants that are considered to be
"doorless" (advarika) because they occur at an inner subliminal level, not
through the intercourse of sense organs and sense objects.52.This refers to the
Abhidhamma classification of thirty-two types of resultant consciousness, of
which twenty-two remain besides the ten types of sense-consciousness, five
resultants of the unwholesome and five of the wholesome. The details are
not necessary here.53.These two definitions involve word plays difficult to
reproduce in English. Ven. 혀namoli has a note suggesting, half flippantly,
"minding" for namana and "mattering" for ruppana.54.In fact the Visuddhimagga
discusses the four great elements not in its chapter on the Description of
the Aggregates (Ch. XIV), but in the chapter on the meditation subject
called the definition of the elements (Ch. XI).55.Some instances of derived
materiality are: the five sense faculties, color, sound, smell, taste, the life faculty,
sexual determination, nutritive essence, space, etc.56.The three planes of
existence were enumerated in Section 30. Only resultant consciousness is
taken into account here because this is an exposition of the round.57.The
figures for the types of consciousness again come from the Abhidhamma.
These types of consciousness can come to expression either through the door
of bodily action or the door of speech, or they can remain within and not
gain outer expression.58.The nine types of volition which do not come to
expression by body or speech are the five volitions of the five fine-material-sphere
jhanas and the four of the four immaterial-sphere jhanas.59.Elsewhere the
Buddha says: "A first point of ignorance cannot be discovered, of which it can
be said: Before that there was no ignorance and it came to be after that"
(A.10:61/v,113). In that sutta the Buddha cites the five hindrances as the condition
for ignorance, but as these in turn presuppose ignorance, the vicious cycle is again
established.60.For the identity of the dissenting Elder, see Section 3 and note
7.
