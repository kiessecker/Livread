<!--l. 42244--><p class="indent" >   Nourishing the Roots
<!--l. 42246--><p class="indent" >   The course of spiritual training taught by the Buddha is a double process of
self-transformation and self-transcendence issuing in complete emancipation from
suffering. The process of self-transformation involves the elimination of unwholesome
mental dispositions and their replacement by pure dispositions conducing to
the benefit of oneself and others; the process of self-transcendence focuses
on the abandoning of egocentric notions by seeing with direct insight the
essenceless nature of the bodily and mental processes we normally take to be
"I" and "mine." When this double process is brought to its culmination,
suffering is extinguished, for with the awakening of wisdom the basic root of
suffering &#8212; craving backed by blinding ignorance &#8212; falls away never to rise
again.
<!--l. 42260--><p class="indent" >   Because the unwholesome tendencies and selfish clinging spring from seeds buried
deep in the bottom-most strata of the mind, to eradicate these sources of affliction
and nurture the growth of the liberating vision of reality the Buddha presents his
teaching in the form of a gradual training. Buddhist discipline involves gradual
practice and gradual attainment. It does not burst into completeness at a stroke, but
like a tree or any other living organism, it unfolds organically, as a sequence of
stages in which each stage rests upon its predecessor as its indispensable
foundation and gives rise to its successor as its natural consequent. The principal
stages of this gradual training are three: the training in sila or virtue, the
training in samadhi or concentration, and the training in pañña or wisdom.
If we follow through the comparison of the Buddhist discipline to a tree,
faith (saddha) would be the seed, for it is faith that provides the initial
impulse through which the training is taken up, and faith again that nourishes
the training through every phase of its development. Virtue would be the
roots, for it is virtue that gives grounding to our spiritual endeavors just
as the roots give grounding to a tree. Concentration would be the trunk,

the symbol of strength, non-vacillation, and stability. And wisdom would
be the branches, which yield the flowers of enlightenment and the fruits of
deliverance.
<!--l. 42282--><p class="indent" >   The vigour of the spiritual life, like the vigour of a tree, depends upon healthy
roots. Just as a tree with weak and shallow roots cannot flourish but will grow up
stunted, withered and barren, so a spiritual life devoid of strong roots will also have a
stunted growth incapable of bearing fruit. To attempt to scale the higher stages of
the path it is essential at the outset to nourish the proper roots of the path;
otherwise the result will be frustration, disillusionment, and perhaps even danger.
The roots of the path are the constituents of sila, the factors of moral virtue.
These are the basis for meditation, the ground for all wisdom and higher
achievement.
<!--l. 42293--><p class="indent" >   To say that sila is the precondition for success, however, does not mean, as is too
often believed in conservative Buddhist circles, that one cannot begin to meditate
until one&#8217;s sila is perfect. Such a stipulation would make it almost impossible to start
meditation, since it is the mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom of the meditative
process that bring about the gradual purification of virtue. But to say that
virtue is the basis of practice does mean that the capacity for achievement in
meditation hinges upon the purity of our sila. If our roots of virtue are weak, our
meditation will likewise be weak. If our actions repeatedly clash with the basic
principles of right conduct, our attempts to control the mind in the discipline of
meditation will turn into a self-defeating enterprise, since the springs of our
conduct will be the same defiled states of mind the meditation is intended to
eliminate.
<!--l. 42307--><p class="indent" >   Only when we secure our cultivation upon the foundation of blameless principles
of right action can the inward endeavor of meditation prosper and issue in success.
With true principles of conduct as the base, the roots of virtue will give birth to the
trunk of concentration, the concentrated mind shoot forth the branches of wisdom,
and the branches of wisdom yield the flowers and fruits of enlightenment, culminating
in total freedom from bondage. Therefore, just as a skillful gardener brings a sapling
to growth by first tending to the roots, so the earnest seeker of enlightenment should
begin his cultivation by tending to the roots of his practice &#8212; that is, to his sila or
moral virtue.
<!--l. 42319--><p class="indent" >   The Pali word sila originally meant simply conduct. But in the context of the
Buddhist spiritual training the term is used to signify only a specific kind of conduct,
i.e., good conduct, and by an extension of meaning, the type of character for
which such conduct stands, i.e., good character. Hence sila means both moral
conduct, a body of habits governed by moral principles, and moral virtue,
the interior quality the regular observance of these principles is intended to
produce.
<!--l. 42327--><p class="indent" >   Both shades of meaning are essential to understand the place of sila in the
spectrum of Buddhist discipline. Sila in the former sense consists in the
non-transgression through body or speech of the basic precepts regulating the moral
life. It is moral discipline in deed and word, beginning as the inhibition of immoral
impulses seeking an outlet through body and speech, and developing into the
habitual conformation to the principles of righteous conduct. But the full range of

sila is not exhausted by mere outward behavioral control, for the term has in
addition a deeper, more psychological significance. In this second sense sila is
moral purity, the inner purification of character which results from a life
consistently moulded upon moral principles. This aspect of sila places the
stress on the subjective, motivational side of action. It looks not towards the
outward act itself, but towards the rectitude of mind from which good conduct
springs.
<!--l. 42342--><p class="indent" >   Upon inspection sila thus reveals itself to be a two- dimensional quality: it
contains an external dimension consisting in purification of conduct, and an internal
dimension consisting in purification of character. However, in the Teaching of the
Buddha, these two dimensions of experience, the internal and the external, are not
torn apart and consigned to separate, self-sufficient domains. They are recognized,
rather, to be two facets of a single whole, complementary poles of a unified field
which mirror one another, implicate one another, and penetrate one another with
their own respective potentialities of influence. Actions performed by body and
speech are not, from the Buddhist standpoint, so many detachable appendages of
a distinct spiritual essence, but concrete revelations of the states of mind
which stand behind them as their activating source. And states of mind, in
turn, do not remain closed up in a purely mental isolation, but spill forth
according to the play of circumstances from the fountain of consciousness where
they arise, through the channels of body, speech and thought, out into the
world of inter-personally significant events. From the action we can infer
the state of mind, and from the state of mind we can predict the probable
course of action. The relationship between the two is as integral as that
between a musical score and its orchestrated performance on the concert
stage.
<!--l. 42364--><p class="indent" >   Because of this mutual dependence of the two domains, moral conduct
and purity of character lock up with one another in a subtle and complex
interrelationship. The fulfillment of the purification of virtue requires that both
aspects of sila be realized: on the one side, behavior of body and speech
must be brought into accord with the moral ideal; on the other, the mental
disposition must be cleansed of its corruptions until it is impeccably pure. The
former without the latter is insufficient; the latter without the former is
impossible. Between the two, the internal aspect is the more important from the
standpoint of spiritual development, since bodily and verbal deeds acquire ethical
significance primarily as expressions of a corresponding disposition of mind.
In the sequence of spiritual training, however, it is moral discipline that
comes first. For at the beginning of training, purification of character stands
as an ideal which must be reached; it is not a reality with which one can
start.
<!--l. 42380--><p class="indent" >   According to the Buddhist principle of conditionality, the actualization of any
given state is only possible through the actualization of its appropriate conditions,
and this applies as much to the achievement of the various stages of the training as
to the bare phenomena of matter and mind. Since beginningless time the
consciousness-continuum has been corrupted by the unwholesome roots of greed,
hatred and delusion; it is these defilements which have functioned as the source for

the greatest number of our thoughts, the ground for our habits, and the springs for
our actions and general orientation towards other people and the world as a whole.
To uproot these defiling afflictions at a single stroke and reach the peak of spiritual
perfection by a mere act of will is a well-near impossible task. A realistic system of
spiritual training must work with the raw material of human nature; it cannot rest
content merely with postulated paragons of human excellence or demands for
achievement without showing the method by which such demands can be
realized.
<!--l. 42397--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha rests his teaching upon the thesis that with the right method we
have the capacity to change and transform ourselves. We are not doomed to be for
ever burdened by the weight of accumulated tendencies, but through our own
effort we can cast off all these tendencies and attain a condition of complete
purity and freedom. When given the proper means in the context of right
understanding, we can bring about radical alterations in the workings of
consciousness and mould a new shape out of the seemingly immutable stuff of our
own minds.
<!--l. 42406--><p class="indent" >   The first step on this path is the purification of character, and the efficient means
for the restructuring of character the Buddha provides in the observance of sila as a
set of precepts regulating bodily and verbal conduct. Sila as moral discipline, in other
words, becomes the means for inducing sila as moral virtue. The effectiveness
of this measure stems from the reciprocal interlocking of the internal and
external spheres of experience already referred to. Because the inner and
outer domains are mutually implicated, the one can become the means for
producing deep and lasting changes in the other. Just as a state of mind
expresses itself outwardly in an action &#8212; in deed or speech &#8212; so too the
avoidance and performance of certain actions can recoil upon the mind and
alter the basic disposition of the mental life. If mental states dominated by
greed and hatred can engender deeds of killing, stealing, lying, etc., then the
abstinence on principle from killing, stealing and lying can engender a mental
disposition towards kindliness, contentment, honesty and truthfulness. Thus,
although sila as moral purity may not be the starting point of spiritual training,
conformity to righteous standards of conduct can make it an attainable
end.
<!--l. 42426--><p class="indent" >   The medium which bridges the two dimensions of sila, facilitating the translation
of outward behavior into inner purity, is volition or cetana. Volition is a mental factor
common to every occasion of experience, a universal concomitant of every act of
consciousness. It is the factor which makes experience teleological, i.e., oriented to a
goal, since its specific function is to direct its associated factors towards the
attainment of a particular end. All action (kamma), the Buddha teaches, is in essence
volition, for the act itself is from the ultimate standpoint a manifestation of volition
through one of the three doors of action &#8212; body, speech or mind: "It is volition,
bhikkhus, that I call action. For having willed, one performs an action through body,
speech, or mind."
<!--l. 42439--><p class="indent" >   Volition determines an action as being of a definite sort, and thence imparts to
action its moral significance. But since volition is invariably present in every
state of consciousness, it is in its own nature without ethical distinctiveness.

Volition acquires its distinctive ethical quality from certain other mental
factors known as roots (mula), in association with which it always arises
on occasions of active experience. Roots are of two morally determinate
kinds: unwholesome (akusala) and wholesome (kusala). The unwholesome
roots are greed, hatred and delusion; the wholesome roots are non-greed,
non-hatred and non-delusion. These latter, though expressed negatively,
signify not merely the absence of the defiling factors, but the presence of
positive moral qualities as well; generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom,
respectively.
<!--l. 42452--><p class="indent" >   When volition is driven by the unwholesome roots of greed, hatred and delusion,
it breaks out through the doors of the body and speech in the form of evil deeds &#8212;
as killing, stealing and fornication, as lying, slander, harsh speech and gossip. In this
way the inner world of mental defilement darkens the outer world of spatio-temporal
extension. But the defiled trend of volitional movement, though strong, is not
irrevocable. Unwholesome volition can be supplanted by wholesome volition, and
thence the entire disposition of the mental life made subject to a reversal at its
foundation. This redirecting of volition is initiated by voluntarily undertaking the
observance of principles of conduct belonging to a righteous order &#8212; by
willing to abstain from evil and to practice the good. Then, when volition
tending to break out as evil action is restrained and replaced by volition of the
opposite kind, by the will to behave virtuously in word and deed, a process
of reversal will have been started which, if followed through, can produce
far-reaching alterations in the moral tone of character. For acts of volition do
not spend their full force in their immediate exercise, but rebound upon
the mental current which gave birth to them, re-orienting that current in
the direction towards which they point as their own immanent tendency:
the unwholesome volitions towards moral depravation, and the wholesome
volitions towards moral purification. Each time, therefore, an unwholesome
volition is supplanted by its wholesome opposite, the will to the good is
strengthened.
<!--l. 42476--><p class="indent" >   A process of factor substitution, built upon the law that incompatible mental
qualities cannot be simultaneously present on a single occasion of experience,
then completes the transformation through the efficacity of the associated
roots. Just as unwholesome volitions invariably arise in association with the
unwholesome roots &#8212; with greed, hatred and delusion &#8212; so do wholesome
volitions inevitably bring along with them as their concomitants the wholesome
roots of non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion. Since opposite qualities
cannot co-exist, the replacement of unwholesome volition by wholesome
volition at the same time means the transposition of the unwholesome and the
wholesome roots. Continually called into play by the surge of volition, the
wholesome roots "perfume" the mental stream with the qualities for which
they stand &#8212; with generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom; and these, as
they gather cumulative force, come to prominence as regular propensities of
the personality, eclipsing the inclination towards the unwholesome. In this
way the exercise of wholesome volitions on repeated and varied occasions
effects a transformation of character from its initial moral susceptibility

to a pitch of purity where even the temptation to evil remains at a safe
remove.
<!--l. 42497--><p class="indent" >   Though volition or cetana is the primary instrument of change, the will in itself is
indeterminate, and requires specific guidelines to direct its energy towards the
actualization of the good. A mere "good will,&#8217; from the Buddhist standpoint, is
altogether inadequate, for despite the nobility of the intention, as long as the
intelligence of the agent is clouded with the dust of delusion, the possibility always
lies open that laudable motives might express themselves in foolish or even
destructive courses of action. This has been the case often enough in the past, and
still stands as the perennial bugbear of the ethical generalist. According to the
Buddhist outlook, goodness of will must be translated into concrete courses of action.
It must be regulated by specific principles of right conduct, principles which,
though flexible in their application, possess normative validity independently
of any historical culture or existing scheme of values, entirely by virtue of
their relation to a universal law of moral retribution and their place in the
timeless path of practice leading to deliverance from suffering and the samsaric
round.
<!--l. 42515--><p class="indent" >   To guide the will in its aspiration for the good, the Buddha has prescribed in
definite and lucid terms the factors of moral training which must be fulfilled to
safeguard progress along the path to enlightenment. These factors are comprised in
the three items which make up the aggregate of virtue in the Noble Eightfold Path:
namely, right speech, right action, and right livelihood. Right speech is the avoidance
of all harmful forms of speech &#8212; the abstinence from falsehood, slander,
harsh speech and idle chatter. The speech of the aspirant must be constantly
truthful, conducive to harmony, gentle and meaningful. Right action applies a
brake upon unwholesome bodily action, by prescribing abstinence from the
destruction of life, from stealing, and from sexual misconduct; the latter
means incelibacy in the case of monks, and adultery and other illicit relations
in the case of householders. The behavior of the aspirant must always be
compassionate, honest and pure. And right livelihood requires the avoidance of
trades which inflict harm and suffering upon other living beings, such as
dealing in meat, slaves, weapons, poisons and intoxicants. Avoiding such
harmful trades, the noble disciple earns his living by a peaceful and righteous
occupation.
<!--l. 42535--><p class="indent" >   The training factors embedded in these components of the Noble Eightfold Path
simultaneously inhibit the base, ignoble and destructive impulses of the human mind
and promote the performance of whatever is noble and pure. Though worded
negatively, in terms of the types of conduct they are intended to shut out, they are
positive in effect, for when adopted as guidelines to action, they stimulate the growth
of healthy mental attitudes which come to expression as beneficient courses of
conduct. Intensively, these training rules reach into the recesses of the mind, blunt
the force of unwholesome volition, and redirect the will to the attainment
of the good. Extensively, they reach into the commotion of man&#8217;s social
existence, and arrest the tide of competition, exploitation, grasping, violence and
war. In their psychological dimension they confer mental health, in their
social dimension they promote peace, in their spiritual dimension they serve

as the irreplaceable foundation for all higher progress along the path to
emancipation. Regularly undertaken and put into practice, they check all
mental states rooted in greed, hatred and delusion, promote actions rooted in
non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion, and lead to a life of charity, love and
wisdom.
<!--l. 42555--><p class="indent" >   From this it will be seen that from the Buddhist point of view formulated
rules of conduct are not superfluous accessories to a good will, but necessary
guidelines to right action. They are an essential part of the training, and when
implemented by the force of volition, become a fundamental means to purification.
Especially in the context of the practice of meditation, the training precepts
prevent the eruption of defiled actions destructive to the purpose of the
meditative discipline. By following carefully the prescribed rules of conduct, we
can rest assured that we are avoiding at least the coarser expressions of
greed, hatred and delusion, and that we will not have to face the obstacle
of guilt, anxiety and restlessness that comes in the trail of regular moral
transgressions.
<!--l. 42568--><p class="indent" >   If we return to our earlier comparison of the Buddhist discipline to a tree, and
take virtue to be the roots, then the principles of right conduct become the soil in
which the roots grow. Just as the soil contains the nutritive essences required for the
tree to sprout and flourish, so do the precepts contain the nutriment of purity and
virtue required for the growth of the spiritual life. The precepts embody
the natural conduct of the arahant or perfected saint. For the arahant, his
conduct flows outward as the spontaneous expression of his innate purity.
By his very nature, all his deeds are flawless, free from blemish. He cannot
follow any course of action motivated by desire, ill will, delusion or fear
&#8212; not through any forced conformity to rules, but by the very law of his
being.
<!--l. 42581--><p class="indent" >   The worldling, however, is not immune from the possibility of immoral conduct.
To the contrary, because the unwholesome roots remain firmly planted in the makeup
of his mind, he is constantly prone to the temptation to moral transgression. He is
liable to kill, steal, commit adultery, lie, drink, etc.; and in the absence of any sound
moral code prohibiting such actions, he will often succumb to these liabilities.
Hence the necessity of providing him with a set of ethical principles built
upon the pillars of wisdom and compassion, by which he can regulate his
actions and conform to the natural, spontaneous behavior of the Liberated
One.
<!--l. 42592--><p class="indent" >   A precept is, therefore, from the Buddhist perspective much more than a
prohibition imposed upon conduct from without. Each precept is a tangible
expression of a corresponding attitude of mind, a principle which clothes in the form
of concrete action a beam of the light of inward purity. The precepts render visible
the invisible state of purification. They make it accessible to us by refracting it
through the media of body and speech into specific rules of conduct we can
apply as guides to action when we find ourselves in the diverse situations
they are designed to cover. By bringing our conduct into harmony with the
precepts, we can nourish the root of our spiritual endeavors, our virtue.
And when virtue is made secure, the succeeding stages of the path unfold

spontaneously through the law of the spiritual life, culminating at the crest in the
perfection of knowledge and the serene azure of deliverance. As the Master
says:
<!--l. 42607--><p class="indent" >   For one who is virtuous, bhikkhus, endowed with virtue, no deliberate volition
need be exerted: "Let freedom from remorse arise in me." This is the natural law,
bhikkhus, that freedom from remorse arises in one who is virtuous, endowed with
virtue.
<!--l. 42612--><p class="indent" >   For one who is free from remorse, no deliberate volition need be exerted: "Let
gladness arise in me." This is the natural law, bhikkhus, that gladness arises in one
free from remorse.
<!--l. 42616--><p class="indent" >   For one who is gladdened, no deliberate volition need be exerted: "Let rapture
arise in me." This is the natural law, bhikkhus, that rapture arises in one who is
gladdened.
<!--l. 42620--><p class="indent" >   For one filled with rapture, no deliberate volition need be exerted: "Let my body
become tranquil." This is the natural law, bhikkhus, that for one filled with rapture
the body becomes tranquil.
<!--l. 42625--><p class="indent" >   For one tranquil in body, no deliberate volition need be exerted: "May I
experience bliss." This is the natural law, bhikkhus, that one tranquil in body
experiences bliss.
<!--l. 42629--><p class="indent" >   For one who is blissful, no deliberate volition need be exerted: "Let my mind
become concentrated." This is the natural law, bhikkhus, that for one who is blissful
the mind becomes concentrated.
<!--l. 42633--><p class="indent" >   For one who is concentrated, no deliberate volition need be exerted: "May I know
and see things as they really are." This is the natural law, bhikkhus, that one who is
concentrated knows and sees things as they really are.
<!--l. 42638--><p class="indent" >   For one knowing and seeing things as they really are, no deliberate volition need
be exerted: "May I become disenchanted and dispassionate." This is the natural law,
bhikkhus, that one knowing and seeing things as they really are becomes
disenchanted and dispassionate.
<!--l. 42644--><p class="indent" >   For one who has become disenchanted and dispassionate, no deliberate volition
need be exerted: "May I realize the knowledge and vision of deliverance." This is the
natural law, bhikkhus, that one who is disenchanted and dispassionate realizes the
knowledge and vision of deliverance...
<!--l. 42650--><p class="indent" >   Thus, bhikkhus, one stage flows into the succeeding stage, one stage comes to
fulfillment in the succeeding stage, for crossing over from the hither shore to the
beyond.
<!--l. 42654--><p class="indent" >   Anguttara Nikaya, 10:2
<!--l. 42656--><p class="indent" >   Mind and the Animate Order
<!--l. 42658--><p class="indent" >   As we cast our gaze out upon the landscape of animate nature, it does
not take long before our attention is struck by the tremendous diversity of
forms the animate order displays. The folds of nature&#8217;s lap, we find, teem
with a multitude of living beings as staggering in their range of specific
differentiation as in the sheer impression of their quantitative force. Before our eyes
countless varieties of creatures &#8212; insects and reptiles, fish and birds, mammals
domestic and wild &#8212; turn the earth With its seas and skies into a complex
metropolis, throbbing with the pulse of sentient life. But realms of being

beyond sight &#8212; vouched for by spiritual cosmology, folklore, and the reports of
seers &#8212; are no less crowded, and no less diversified in their composition.
According to this testimony, gods, Brahmas, angels and demons populate
boroughs of the city of life invisible to fleshly eyes, while other creatures,
such as fairies, ghosts and goblins, fill up unfamiliar pockets of the same
borough.
<!--l. 42675--><p class="indent" >   The human world, again, is itself far from homogeneous. The family of man
breaks down into a great diversity of types &#8212; into people black, white, brown, yellow
and red, dividing still further, according to their fortunes and faculties, into the
long-lived and the short-lived, the healthy and the sickly, the successful and the
failures, the gifted and the deprived. Some people are intelligent, others are
dull-witted, some are noble, others ignoble, some are spiritually evolved, others
spiritually destitute. Human beings range all the way from mental retards who can
manage their bodily needs only with great difficulty, to sages and saints who can
comprehend the deepest secrets of the universe and lift the moral outlook of their less
acute brothers and sisters to heights undreamed of in the common stream of
thought.
<!--l. 42689--><p class="indent" >   To the thinker who would dig below the surface presentations and discover the
reasons for the manifest phenomena, the question naturally arises why life exhibits
itself in such variegated apparel. Reflection upon this question has given birth to a
multitude of schools of thought, religious and philosophical, each offering its own
speculations as the key to unravel the riddle of nature&#8217;s kaleidoscopic design. In
the intellectual history of humanity, the two dominant positions around
which these schools cluster are theism and materialism. Pitted against one
another by their antithetical tenets, the two have come down in different
guises from ancient times even to the present. Theism refers the diversity of
sentient life, including the disparities of fortune evident in the human world,
to the will of God. It is God, the theist holds, the omnipotent, omniscient
author of the universe, who creates through the fiat of his will the variety
of natural forms, allots to beings their respective shares of happiness and
suffering, and divides people into the high and the low, the fortunate and the
miserable.
<!--l. 42706--><p class="indent" >   Materialism, in contradistinction, rules out any recourse to an extraterrestrial
agency to account for the differentiation in the faculties and capacities found
amongst living beings, and attempts to provide in its place a system of explanation
which works exclusively with naturalistic principles, pertaining to the material order.
The entire gamut of living forms together with all life&#8217;s modes of expression, the
materialist claims, can be effectively reduced in the end to the adventures of matter
governed by physical, chemical and biological laws. Even consciousness represents, for
the materialist, only a secondary superstructure built upon a material base devoid of
any larger significance in itself.
<!--l. 42717--><p class="indent" >   It is not our present purpose here to examine at length these two rival doctrines.
Let it suffice to note that both, in different ways, throw into jeopardy the postulate
of a progressive spiritual evolution of beings by withholding, implicitly or
explicitly, the necessary condition for such a course of evolution &#8212; namely,
an inwardly autonomous will which finds in the diversity of the sentient

order the field for the working out of its own potentialities for growth and
transformation, in accordance with laws governing freely chosen possibilities of
action.
<!--l. 42727--><p class="indent" >   Theism withholds this condition by its basic postulate of an omnipotent deity
directing the entire field of nature from above. If all of nature runs its course in
obedience to divine command, then the individual will, which belongs to the natural
order, must be subject to the same divine supervision as the rest of animate nature.
The autonomy of the individual will and its direct impact on the sentient sphere are
excluded, and with them also goes the thesis of a genuine long-term spiritual growth,
to which they are essential.
<!--l. 42736--><p class="indent" >   Materialism likewise shuts out the notion of a progressive spiritual evolution of
beings, but more simply and directly, by explicitly denying the basic presupposition
of such a notion. The will&#8217;s claim to freedom is here rejected, its autonomy usurped
by the irresistible pressure of the determinative influences at its base. Consciousness
becomes a mere by-product of material processes; the individual life-stream leaves no
impact on any continuous current of experience enduring beyond the grave. Both
conscious action and evolution in the biotic sphere proceed in the grip of the same
play of cosmic forces &#8212; blind, brute, and insentient in their fundamental mode of
operation.
<!--l. 42747--><p class="indent" >   Buddhism also offers an explanation for the diversity of the sentient order, an
explanation which bridges the gap between volition and the diversity and thus opens
up the prospect for long-term spiritual development. According to Buddhism, the
explanation for the variegation of sentient beings &#8212; in their kinds, faculties,
and fortunes &#8212; lies in their kamma, that is, their volitional action. Beings
are, in the words of the Buddha, "heirs of their action." They spring forth
from their store of accumulated action as a matrix out of which they are
fashioned, inheriting the results proper to their deeds even across the gulf
of lifetimes. Through the succession of life-terms, kamma holds sway over
the individual evolutionary current. Acts of will, once completed, recede
into the forward moving mental stream out of which they emerged, and
remaining in the form of psychic potencies, pilot the future course of evolution
to be taken by that particular current of experience called an "individual
being." Just as the kamma rises up out of the stream of consciousness, so does
the stream of consciousness again flow forth from the germinative kamma,
which thus serves to link into a single chain the series of separated lives. The
kammic force drives the current of consciousness onward into new modes
of existence conformable to its nature; it determines the specific form of
life in which the individual will take remanifestation, the set of faculties
with which the new being will be endowed, and a substantial portion of
the happiness and suffering that being will meet during the course of its
life.
<!--l. 42772--><p class="indent" >   It is, therefore, not God or chance in the Buddhist picture, but the differentiation
in volitional action, functioning across the succession of lives, that accounts for the
differentiation in the animate order, and the differentiation in action again that
divides beings into the high and low, the happy and the miserable, the gifted and the
deprived. As the Buddha declares: "Beings are the owners of their actions, heirs

of their actions. Their action is the source from which they spring, their
kinsman and their refuge. Action divides beings into the inferior and the
superior."
<!--l. 42782--><p class="indent" >   Since the effective determinant of destiny is kamma, and kamma is essentially
volition, this means that the operative factor in the formation of future becoming is
lodged in the individual will. The will, from the Buddhist perspective, is no
accidental offshoot of the machinery of nature, compelled to its course by the
conspiracy of cosmic forces; it is, rather, in the deepest sense the artisan behind the
entire process of animate evolution. Here will is primary and the material factors
secondary, the plastic substance with which the will works and by which it gives
tangible expression to its store of dispositional tendencies. The varied landscape of
sentient existence, for Buddhism, represents but an outward register of the inward
transactions of the will, and the hierarchy of living forms &#8212; the "great chain of
being" &#8212; but a congellation of its functional modalities in the world of
spatio-temporal extension.
<!--l. 42797--><p class="indent" >   Differentiation in the biological sphere is thus preceded and paralleled by a set of
transformations in the mental sphere, which finds in animate nature the channel for
actualizing its own potentialities throughout the series of successive becomings
comprising the individual continuum. Through the exercise of our will, therefore, we
build for ourselves our own world independent of coercion by extrinsic forces and
mould the destiny that awaits us in time to come, whether for happiness or misery,
for bondage or liberation.
<!--l. 42806--><p class="indent" >   For the spiritual aspirant, however, it is not sufficient merely to understand the
theoretical ground for the differentiation of living beings. For us it is of the utmost
importance to know what we can do to further our own progress along the scale of
spiritual evolution &#8212; to advance to higher levels of attainment during the course of
our earthly life, to secure a rebirth conducive to spiritual growth in the life to come,
and ultimately to transcend this repetitive cycle of birth and death and attain
Nibbana, the supreme and irreversible deliverance.
<!--l. 42816--><p class="indent" >   The answer to this problem begins with the fact that kamma divides itself,
according to its moral quality, into two types &#8212; the unwholesome (akusala)
and the wholesome (kusala). Unwholesome kamma is action &#8212; physical,
verbal or mental &#8212; that springs from the three unwholesome roots of action:
greed (lobha), hatred (dosa) and delusion (moha). Any action grounded in
these roots is spiritually detrimental and morally defective. It destroys the
higher faculties, entails suffering as its consequence, and causes a plunge
into lower states of existence; in short, it brings decline along the scale of
spiritual evolution and deeper immersion in the mire of phenomenal existence.
Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action springing from the three
contrary wholesome roots &#8212; non-greed (alobha), non-hatred (adosa) and
non-delusion (amoha), finding positive expression in the qualities of charity,
loving-kindness and wisdom, respectively. Wholesome action functions in a way
diametrically opposite to its dark counterpart. It is spiritually beneficial and
morally commendable, stimulates the unfolding of the higher faculties, and
entails happiness both in the present and in time to come. Consistently
practiced, it promotes progress along the evolutionary scale, leading to higher

states of existence in successive life-spans, and finally to the realization of
deliverance.
<!--l. 42838--><p class="indent" >   On ultimate analysis, life is a self-regenerating sequence of occasions of
experience, comprising occasions of action and occasions of reception. Action is
volition, and volition inevitably involves decision or choice &#8212; a selection
from the welter of possibilities open to the will of that alternative most,
conformable to the individual&#8217;s purpose, a selection even, at a higher level,
of the purposes themselves. Every moment of morally significant action,
therefore, confronts us with the call for a decision, with the necessity for
choice. Choice must work within the gamut of options open to the will,
and these options, despite their great differences of qualitative character,
necessarily fall into one of two classes according to their ethical nature &#8212; into the
wholesome or the unwholesome. The one leads to progress, the other to
decline.
<!--l. 42852--><p class="indent" >   Thence progress or decline depends entirely upon our choice, and not upon any
external agency whether conceived in spiritualistic or materialistic garb. Through our
fleeting, momentary decisions, accumulated over long periods, we model our fortune
and chisel out of the unshaped block of futurity the destiny that will befall us in the
span of time to come. Each call for a decision may be depicted as a ladder, one end
leading upward to unknown heights, and the other extending downward into
forbidding depths, while our successive decisions may be taken as the steps that lead
us up or down the ladder&#8217;s graded rungs. Or again, each moment of action may
be compared to a crossroad at which we stand, a forked road one side of
which leads to a city of bliss and the other to a swampland of misery and
despair. The two roads stand, fixed and silent, awaiting our choice, and only
our decision determines whether we shall reach the one destination or the
other.
<!--l. 42867--><p class="indent" >   In sum, then, it is our kamma that precipitates our destiny, for it is kamma
that brings about manifestation of all the destinations (gati) or realms of
sentient existence, and kamma ultimately that fashions the entire variegated
landscape of sentient existence itself, according to the ethical tone of its
associated moral roots. As the Exalted One explains, speaking not through
speculation but through his own direct penetration of the paths leading to all
destinations:
<!--l. 42875--><p class="indent" >   It is not celestial beings (deva), or humans, or any other creatures belonging to
happy forms of existence, that appear through action (kamma) born of greed,
born of hate, born of delusion; it is rather beings of the hells, of the animal
kingdom, of the ghostly realm, or any other others of miserable form of
existence that make their appearance through action born of greed, hate and
delusion...
<!--l. 42882--><p class="indent" >   It is not creatures of the hells, of the animal kingdom, of the ghostly realm, or any
others of a miserable form of existence, that appear through action born of
non-greed, born of non-hate, born of non-delusion; it is rather celestial beings,
humans, or any other creatures belonging to a happy form of existence that
make their appearance through action born of non-greed, non-hate, and
non-delusion.

<!--l. 42889--><p class="indent" >   Anguttara Nikaya, 6:39
<!--l. 42891--><p class="indent" >   Merit and Spiritual Growth
<!--l. 42893--><p class="indent" >   The performance of deeds of merit forms one of the most essential elements of
Buddhist practice. Its various modes provide in their totality a compendium of
applied Buddhism, showing Buddhism not as a system of ideas but as a
complete way of life. Buddhist popular belief has often emphasized merit
as a productive source of worldly blessings &#8212; of health, wealth, long life,
beauty and friends. As a result of this emphasis, meritorious activity has
come to be conceived rather in terms of a financial investment, as a religious
business venture yielding returns to the satisfaction of the agent&#8217;s mundane
desires. While such a conception no doubt contains an element of truth, its
popularization has tended to eclipse the more important function merit plays in
the context of Buddhist practice. Seen in correct perspective, merit is an
essential ingredient in the harmony and completeness of the spiritual life, a
means of self-cultivation, and an indispensable stepping-stone to spiritual
progress.
<!--l. 42909--><p class="indent" >   The accumulation of a "stock of merit" is a primary requisite for acquiring
all the fruits of the Buddhist religious life, from a pleasant abiding here
and now to a favorable rebirth in the life to come, from the initial stages of
meditative progress to the realization of the states of sanctity that come as
the fruits of entering upon the noble path. The highest fruition of merit is
identical with the culmination of the Buddhist holy life itself &#8212; that is,
emancipation from the shackles of samsaric existence and the realization of
Nibbana, the unconditioned state beyond the insubstantial phenomena of the
world. The mere piling up of merit, to be sure, is not in itself sufficient to
guarantee the attainment of this goal. Merit is only one requisite, and it must
be balanced by its counterpart to secure the breakthrough from bondage
to final freedom. The counterpart of merit is knowledge (ñana), the direct
confrontation with the basic truths of existence through the eye of intuitive
wisdom.
<!--l. 42926--><p class="indent" >   Merit and knowledge together constitute the two sets of equipment the
spiritual aspirant requires in the quest for deliverance, the equipment of merit
(puññasambhara) and the equipment of knowledge (ñanasambhara), respectively.
Each set of equipment has its own contribution to make to the fulfillment of the
spiritual life. The equipment of merit facilitates progress in the course of samsaric
wandering: it brings a favorable rebirth, the encounter with good friends to guide
one&#8217;s footsteps along the path, the meeting with opportunities for spiritual growth,
the flowering of the lofty qualities of character, and the maturation of the spiritual
faculties required for the higher attainments. The equipment of knowledge brings the
factor directly necessary for cutting the bonds of samsaric existence: the penetration
of truth, enlightenment, the undistorted comprehension of the nature of
actuality.
<!--l. 42941--><p class="indent" >   Either set of equipment, functioning in isolation, is insufficient to the attainment
of the goal; either pursued alone leads to a deviant, one-sided development that
departs from the straight path to deliverance taught by the Buddha. Merit
without knowledge produces pleasant fruit and a blissful rebirth, but cannot

issue in the transcendence of the mundane order and entrance upon the
supramundane path. And knowledge without the factors of merit deteriorates into
dry intellectualism, mere erudition or scholasticism, impotent when confronted
with the task of grasping a truth outside the pale of intellection. But when
they function together in unison in the life of the aspirant, the two sets of
equipment acquire a potency capable of propelling him to the heights of
realization. When each set of equipment complements the other, polishes
the other, and perfects the other, then they undergo a graduated course of
mutual purification culminating at the crest in the twin endowments of the
Emancipated One &#8212; in that clear knowledge (vijja) and flawless conduct (carana)
which make him, in the words of the Buddha, "supreme among gods and
humans."
<!--l. 42960--><p class="indent" >   But while merit and knowledge thus occupy coordinate positions, it is merit that
claims priority from the standpoint of spiritual dynamics. The reason is that works of
merit come first in the process of inner growth. If knowledge be the flower that gives
birth to the fruit of liberation, and faith (saddha) the seed out of which the flower
unfolds, then merit is the soil, water and fertilizer all in one &#8212; the indispensable
nutriment for every stage of growth. Merit paves the way for knowledge, and finds in
knowledge the sanction for its own claim to a place in the system of Buddhist
training.
<!--l. 42970--><p class="indent" >   The reason for this particular sequential structure is closely linked to the
Buddhist conception of noetic realization. From the Buddhist standpoint
the comprehension of spiritual truth is not a matter of mere intellectual
cogitation but of existential actualization. That is, it is a matter of grasping
with our whole being the truth towards which we aspire, and of inwardly
appropriating that truth in a manner so total and complete that our being
becomes transformed into a very reflex and effusion of the truth upon which
we stand. The understanding of truth in the context of the spiritual life,
in other words, is no affair of accumulating bits and pieces of information
publicly accessible and subjectively indifferent; it is, rather, a process of
uncovering the deepest truths about ourselves and about the world, and
of working the understanding that emerges into the entire complex of the
inner life. Hence the use of the words "actualization" and "realization,"
which bring into the open the ontological backdrop underlying the noetic
process.
<!--l. 42987--><p class="indent" >   In order to grasp truth in this totalistic manner at any particular stage of
spiritual development, the tenor of our inner being must be raised to a pitch where it
is fit for the reception of some new disclosure of the truth. Wisdom and character,
though not identical, are at any rate parallel terms, which in most cases mature in a
delicately balanced ratio. We can grasp only what we are fit to grasp, and our fitness
is largely a function of our character. The existential comprehension of truth thus
becomes a matter of inward worth, of deservingness, or of merit. The way to effect
this inward worthiness is by the performance of works of merit, not merely
outwardly, but backed by the proper attitudes and disposition of mind. For the
capacity to comprehend truths pertaining to the spiritual order is always
proportional to the store and quality of accumulated merit. The greater

and finer the merit, the larger and deeper the capacity for understanding.
This principle holds at each level of maturation in the ascent towards full
realization, and applies with special force to the comprehension of ultimate
truth.
<!--l. 43005--><p class="indent" >   Ultimate truth, in the Buddha&#8217;s Teaching, is Nibbana, the unconditioned element
(asankhata dhatu), and realization of ultimate truth the realization of Nibbana.
Nibbana is the perfection of purity: the destruction of all passions, the eradication of
clinging, the abolition of every impulse towards self-affirmation. The final thrust to
the realization of Nibbana is the special province of wisdom, since wisdom alone is
adequate to the task of comprehending all conditioned phenomena in their essential
nature as impermanent, suffering and not-self, and of turning away from them to
penetrate the unconditioned, where alone permanent freedom from suffering is to be
found. But that this penetration may take place, our interior must be made
commensurate in purity with the truth it would grasp, and this requires in the first
instance that it be purged of all those elements obstructive to the florescence of a
higher light and knowledge. The apprehension of Nibbana, this perfect purity
secluded from the dust of passion, is only possible when a corresponding
purity has been set up within ourselves. For only a pure mind can discern,
through the dark mist of ignorance and defilement, the spotless purity of
Nibbana, abiding in absolute solitude beyond the turmoil of the phenomenal
procession.
<!--l. 43025--><p class="indent" >   The achievement of such a purification of our inward being is the work of merit.
Merit scours the mind of the coarser defilements, attenuates the grip of the
unwholesome roots, and fortifies the productive power of the wholesome, beneficial
states. Through its cumulative force it provides the foundation for wisdom&#8217;s final
breakthrough to the unconditioned. It is the fuel, so to speak, for the ascent of
wisdom from the mundane to the supramundane. Just as the initial stages of a lunar
rocket work up the momentum that enables the uppermost stage to break the
gravitational pull of the earth and reach the moon, so does merit give to the spiritual
life that forward thrust that will propel the wisdom-faculty past the gravitational
pull of the mundane order and permit it to penetrate the transcendental
truth.
<!--l. 43038--><p class="indent" >   The classical Buddhist commentators underscore this preparatory purgative
function of merit when they define merit (puñña) etymologically as "that which
purges and purifies the mental continuum" (santanam punati visodheti). Merit
performs its purgative function in the context of a complex process involving an
agent and object of purification, and a mode of operation by which the purification
takes place. The agent of purification is the mind itself, in its creative, formative role
as the source and matrix of action. Deeds of merit are, as we have already seen,
instances of wholesome kamma, and kamma ultimately reduces to volition. Therefore,
at the fundamental level of analysis, a deed of merit consists in a volition, a
determinative act of will belonging to the righteous order (puññabhisankhara).
Since volition is a mode of mental activity, this means that merit turns out,
under scrutiny, to be a mode of mental activity. It is, at the core of the
behavior-pattern which serves as its vehicle, a particular application of thought by
which the mind marshalls its components for the achievement of a chosen

end.
<!--l. 43056--><p class="indent" >   This discovery cautions us against misconstruing the Buddhist stress on the
practice of merit as a call for blind subjection to rules and rites. The primary
instrument behind any act of merit, from the Buddhist point of view, is the mind.
The deed itself in its physical or vocal dimension serves mainly as an expression of
a corresponding state of consciousness, and without a keen awareness of
the nature and significance of the meritorious deed, the bare outward act
is devoid of purgative value. Even when rules of conduct are observed, or
rituals and worship performed with a view to the acquisition of merit, the
spiritual potency of these structures derives not from any intrinsic sanctity they
might possess in themselves, but from their effectiveness in channelizing the
current of mental activity in a spiritual beneficial direction. They function, in
effect, as skillful means or expedient devices for inducing wholesome states of
consciousness.
<!--l. 43071--><p class="indent" >   Mechanical conformity to moral rules, or the performance of religious duties
through unquestioning obedience to established forms, far from serving as a means to
salvation, in the Buddhist outlook actually constitute obstacles. They are
instances of "clinging to rules and rituals" (silabbataparamasa), the third of
the fetters (samyojana) binding beings to the wheel of becoming, which
must be abandoned in order to enter upon the path to final deliverance.
Even in such relatively external forms of merit-making as the undertaking of
moral precepts and ceremonial worship, mindfulness and clear comprehension
are essential; much more, then, are they necessary to the predominantly
internal modes of meritorious activity, such as meditation or the study of the
Dhamma.
<!--l. 43084--><p class="indent" >   The object of the purifying process of merit is again the mind, only here
considered not from the standpoint of its immediacy, as a creative source of action,
but from the standpoint of its duration, as a continuum (cittasantana). For, looked at
from the temporal point of view, the mind is no stable entity enduring self-identical
through its changing activities; it is, rather, a serial continuity composed of discrete
acts of mentation bound to one another by exact laws of causal interconnection. Each
thought-unit flashes into being, persists for an extremely brief moment, and
then perishes, passing on to its immediate successor its storage of recorded
impressions. Each individual member of the series inherits, preserves and
transmits, along with its own novel modifications, the entire content of the
series as a whole, which thus underlies every one of its components. Thence
the series maintains, despite its discontinuous composition, an element of
uniformity that gives to the flow of separate thought-moments the character of a
continuum.
<!--l. 43100--><p class="indent" >   This sequential current of mentation has been going on, according to Buddhism,
without discernible beginning. Driven forward from life to life by ignorance and
craving, it appears now in one mode of manifestation, now in another. Embedded in
the mental continuum throughout its beginningless journey is a host of particularly
afflictive and disruptive mental forces known as kilesas, "defilements." Foremost
among them are the three unwholesome roots &#8212; greed, hatred and delusion; from
this triad spring the remaining members of the set, such as pride, opinion,

selfishness, envy, sloth and restlessness. During moments of passivity the
defilements lie dormant at the base of the mental continuum, as anusaya or
latent tendencies. But when, either through the impact of outer sensory
stimuli or their own subliminal process of growth, they acquire sufficient
force, they surge to the surface of consciousness in the form of obsessions
(pariyutthana). The obsessions pollute the mind with their toxic flow and
rebound upon the deeper levels of consciousness, reinforcing their roots at
the base of the continuum. If they should gather still additional charge,
the defilements may reach the even more dangerous stage of transgression
(vitikkama), when they erupt as bodily or verbal actions that violate the
fundamental laws of morality and lead to pain and suffering as their retributive
consequence.
<!--l. 43122--><p class="indent" >   When merit is said to "purge and purify the mental continuum," it is so described
in reference to its capacity to arrest the surging tide of the defilements which
threatens to sweep the mind towards the perilous deep of transgressional action. Only
wisdom &#8212; the supramundane wisdom of the noble paths &#8212; can eradicate
the defilements at the level of latency, which is necessary if the bonds of
existence are to be broken and deliverance attained. But the practice of
merit can contribute much towards attenuating their obsessive force and
establishing a foothold for wisdom to exercise its liberating function. Wisdom
can operate only upon the base of a purified mind; the accumulation of
merit purifies the mind; hence merit provides the supporting condition for
wisdom.
<!--l. 43135--><p class="indent" >   When the mind is allowed to flow according to its own momentum, without
restraint or control, like a turbulent river it casts up to the surface &#8212; i.e., to the level
of active consciousness &#8212; the store of pollutants it harbors at its base: lust, hatred,
delusion, and their derivative defilements. If the defilements are then given further
scope to grow by indulging them, they will wither the potential for good, darken the
beam of awareness, and strangle the faculty of wisdom until it is reduced to a mere
vestige. The performance of meritorious deeds serves as a means of resisting the
upsurge of defiling states, of replacing them with their wholesome opposites, and of
thereby purifying the mental continuum to an extent sufficient to supply
wisdom with the storage of strength it requires in the work of abolishing the
defilements.
<!--l. 43149--><p class="indent" >   The effectiveness of merit in purifying the mental continuum stems from the
concordance of a number of psychological laws. These laws, which can only be
indicated briefly here, together function as the silent groundwork for the efficacy of
the entire corpus of Buddhist spiritual practice.
<!--l. 43155--><p class="indent" >   The first is the law that only one state of consciousness can occur at a time;
though seemingly trivial, this law leads to important consequences when taken in
conjunction with the rest. The second holds that states of consciousness with
mutually opposed ethical qualities cannot coexist. The third stipulates that all the
factors of consciousness &#8212; feeling, perception, volition and the remaining states
included in the "aggregate of mental formations" &#8212; must partake of the same ethical
quality as the consciousness itself.
<!--l. 43164--><p class="indent" >   A kammically active state of consciousness is either entirely wholesome, or

entirely unwholesome; it cannot (by the second law) be both. Therefore, if a
wholesome state is occurring, no unwholesome state can simultaneously occur. A
wholesome, spiritually beneficial state of consciousness necessarily shuts out every
unwholesome, detrimental state, as well as (by the third law) all unwholesome
concomitant factors of consciousness. So at the moment one is performing an act
of merit, the consciousness and volition behind that meritorious deed will
automatically preclude an unwholesome consciousness, volition, and the
associated defilements. At that moment, at least, the consciousness will be pure.
And the frequent performance of meritorious acts will, on every occasion,
bar out the opportunity for the defilements to arise at the time of their
performance.
<!--l. 43178--><p class="indent" >   Thus the performance of deeds of merit always induces a momentary purification,
while the frequent performance of such deeds induces many occasions of
momentary purification. But that some more durable result might be achieved an
additional principle is necessary. This principle is supplied by the fourth
law.
<!--l. 43184--><p class="indent" >   The fourth law holds that repetition confers strength. Just as the exercise of a
particular muscle can transform that muscle from a frail, ineffectual strip of flesh into
a dynamo of power and strength, so the repeated exercise of individual mental
qualities can remodel them from sleeping soldiers into invincible warriors in the
spiritual quest.
<!--l. 43190--><p class="indent" >   Repetition is the key to the entire process of self-transformation which
constitutes the essence of the spiritual life. It is the very grounding that makes
self-transformation possible. By force of repetition the fragile, tender shoots of the
pure and wholesome qualities &#8212; faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and
wisdom &#8212; can blossom into sovereign faculties (indriya) in the struggle for
enlightenment, or into indomitable powers (bala) in the battle against the
defilements. By repeated resistance to the upsurge of evil and repeated application to
the cultivation of the good, the demon can become a god and the criminal a
saint.
<!--l. 43201--><p class="indent" >   If repetition provides the key to self-transformation, then volition provides the
instrument through which repetition works. Volition acts as a vector force upon
the mental continuum out of which it emerges, reorienting the continuum
according to its own moral tone. Each act of will recedes with its passing
into the onward rushing current of mentation and drives the current in its
own direction. Wholesome volitions direct the continuum towards the good
&#8212; towards purity, wisdom and ultimate liberation; unwholesome volitions
drive it towards the evil &#8212; towards defilement, ignorance and inevitable
bondage.
<!--l. 43212--><p class="indent" >   Every occasion of volition modifies the mental life in some way and to some
degree, however slight, so that the overall character of an individual at any one
time stands as a reflex and revelation of the volitions accumulated in the
continuum.
<!--l. 43217--><p class="indent" >   Since the will propels the entire current of mental life in its own direction, it is
the will which must be strengthened by force of repetition. The restructuring of
mental life can only take place through the reformation of the will by leading it unto

wholesome channels. The effective channel for re-orientation of the will is the practice
of merit.
<!--l. 43223--><p class="indent" >   When the will is directed towards the cultivation of merit, it will spontaneously
hamper the stream of defilements and bolster the company of noble qualities in the
storage of the continuum. Under its gentle tutelage the factors of purity will awaken
from their dormant condition and take their place as regular propensities in the
personality. A will devoted to the practice of charity will generate kindness and
compassion; a will devoted to the observance of the precepts will generate
harmlessness, honesty, restraint, truthfulness and sobriety; a will devoted to mental
culture will generate calm and insight. Faith, reverence, humility, sympathy, courage
and equanimity will come to growth. Consciousness will gain in tranquillity,
buoyancy, pliancy, agility and proficiency. And a consciousness made pure by these
factors will advance without hindrance through the higher attainments in meditation
and wisdom to the realization of Nibbana, the consummation of spiritual
endeavor.
<!--l. 43239--><p class="indent" >   The Path of Understanding
<!--l. 43241--><p class="indent" >   Prince Siddhattha renounced the life of the palace and entered the forest as a
hermit seeking a solution to the problem of suffering. Six years after entering he came
out a Buddha, ready to show others the path he had found so that they too could
work out their deliverance. It was the experience of being bound to the
perishable and unsatisfying that gave the impetus to the Buddha&#8217;s original
quest, and it was the certainty of having found the unperishing and perfectly
complete that inspired the execution of his mission. Thence the Buddha could
sum up his Teaching in the single phrase: "I teach only suffering and the
cessation of suffering." But though the Buddha&#8217;s Teaching might be simple in
its statement, the meaning behind the verbal formulation is profound and
precise.
<!--l. 43254--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha envisages suffering in its full range and essence rather than in its
mere manifest forms. It is not just physical or mental pain that he means by
suffering, but the recurrent revolution of the wheel of becoming, with its spokes of
birth, aging and death. Taking our immersion in a condition intrinsically inadequate
as the starting point of his doctrine, he devotes the remainder to showing the
way out of this condition. The solution the Buddha offers to the problem
of suffering draws its cogency from the strict logic of causality. Suffering
is neither an accident nor an imposition from without, but a contingent
phenomenon arising through the force of conditions. It hangs upon a specific set of
supports, and is therefore susceptible to treatment by tackling the genetic
structure which maintains it in being. By removing the conditions out of which
it arises, it is possible to bring the whole phenomenon of suffering to an
end.
<!--l. 43269--><p class="indent" >   In order to reach the state of emancipation, it is of the first importance that the
causal chain which originates suffering be snapped in the right place. Any
proposed solution which does not remedy the problem of suffering at its
source will eventually prove to be only a palliative, not a final cure. That the
chain be broken in the right place requires an accurate determination of the
interconnection of its links. The chain must be traced back to its most fundamental

factor and cut off at that very point. Then suffering will no longer be able to
arise.
<!--l. 43278--><p class="indent" >   According to the Buddha&#8217;s Teaching, the primary link in the sequence of
conditions generating suffering is ignorance (avijja). Ignorance is a primordial
blindness to the true nature of phenomena; it is a lack of understanding of things as
they really are. It functions as a mental obscuration cloaking our normal
process of cognition and permeating our thought patterns with distortion and
error.
<!--l. 43285--><p class="indent" >   Among the various misconceptions produced by ignorance, the most basic is the
apprehension of phenomena through the category of substantial existence.
Phenomena are not isolated units locked up in themselves, but participants in an
interconnected field of events. Their being derives from the entire system of relata to
which they belong, not from some immutable core of identity intrinsic to themselves.
Thence they are devoid of an abiding essence; their mode of being is insubstantial,
relational and interdependent. However, under the influence of ignorance, this
essenceless nature of phenomena is not understood. It is blotted out by the basic
unawareness, and as a consequence, phenomena present themselves to cognition in a
mode different from their actual mode of being. They appear substantial,
self-subsistent, and exclusivistic.
<!--l. 43298--><p class="indent" >   The sphere where this illusion is most immediately felt is the sphere where it is
most accessible to us &#8212; namely, our own experience. The experiential domain is
reflectively divisible into two sectors &#8212; a cognizing or subjective sector made up of
consciousness and its adjuncts, and a cognized or objective sector made up of the
cognitive data. Though the two sectors are interlocking and mutually dependent,
through the operation of ignorance they are conceptually bifurcated and reduced to
an adventitious subject-object confrontation. On the one side the cognizing sector is
split off from the experiential complex and conceived as a subject distinct from the
cognitive act itself; the objective sector in turn congeals into a world of external
things pointing to the subject as its field of action and concern. Consciousness
awakens to itself as a persisting ego standing up against the world as an "other"
perpetually estranged from itself. Thence it commences its long career of conquest,
control and domination in order to justify its own suspect claim to a self-subsistent
mode of being.
<!--l. 43316--><p class="indent" >   This cognitive error with its consequent solidification of the ego is the source of
the afflictions (kilesa) which hold us in subjection to suffering. The lurking suspicion
that the mode of being we credit to ourselves may be unfounded arouses an inner
disquietude, a chronic anxiety compelling a drive to fortify the sense of egoity and
give it solid ground on which to stand. We need to establish our existence to
ourselves, to give inner confirmation to our conception of personal substantiality, and
this need occasions the ordering of the psychic life around the focal point of
ego.
<!--l. 43326--><p class="indent" >   The bid for self-confirmation makes its impact felt on both the emotional and
intellectual fronts. The dominion of the ego in the emotional sphere appears most
conspicuously in the weight of the unwholesome roots &#8212; greed, hatred and delusion
&#8212; as determinants of conduct. Because the ego is essentially a vacuum, the illusion of
egohood generates a nagging sense of insufficiency. We feel oppressed by an aching

incompleteness, an inner lack requiring constantly to be filled. The result is greed, a
relentless drive to reach out and devour whatever we can &#8212; of pleasure, wealth,
power and fame &#8212; in a never successful attempt to bring the discomfort fully to an
end. When our drive to satisfaction meets with frustration we react with hatred,
the urge to destroy the obstacle between our desire and its satisfaction. If
the obstructions to our satisfaction prove too powerful for the tactics of
aggression, a third strategy will be used: dullness or delusion, an attitude
of deliberate unawareness adopted as a shell to hide our vulnerability to
pain.
<!--l. 43343--><p class="indent" >   On the intellectual front the ego-illusion engenders a move by reason to establish
on logical grounds the existence of a substantial self. The idea "I am" is a
spontaneous notion born of ignorance, the basic unawareness of the egoless nature of
phenomena. By accepting this idea at its face value, as pointing to a real "I," and by
attempting to fill in the reference, we develop a "view of self," a belief confirming the
existence of a self and giving it an identity in the framework of our psycho-physical
constitution.
<!--l. 43353--><p class="indent" >   The theories which emerge invariably fall into one or another of the two
metaphysical extremes &#8212; either eternalism when we assume the self to enjoy eternal
existence after death, or annihilationism, when we assume the self to be extinguished
at death. Neither doctrine can be established on absolutely compelling grounds, for
both are rounded on a common error: the assumption of a self as an enduring,
substantial entity.
<!--l. 43361--><p class="indent" >   Because the pivot of our cognitive adherences and their emotional ramifications is
the notion of an ego, a powerful current of psychic energy comes to be invested in our
interpretive schemes. And because the notion of an ego is in actuality groundless, the
product of a fundamental misconception, this investment of energy brings only
disappointment in the end. We cling to things in the hope that they will be
permanent, satisfying and substantial, and they turn out to be impermanent,
unsatisfying and insubstantial. We seek to impose our will upon the order of events,
and we find that events obey a law of their own, insubordinate to our urge towards
control.
<!--l. 43372--><p class="indent" >   The result of our clinging is eventual suffering. Yet this suffering which arises
from the breakdown of our egocentric attempts at dominance and manipulation
is not entirely negative in value. It contains a tremendous positive value,
a vast potential, for by shattering our presumptions it serves to awaken
our basic intelligence and set us on the quest for liberation. It forces us
to discover the ultimate futility of our drive to structure the world from
the standpoint of the ego, and makes us recognize the need to acquire a
new perspective free from the compulsive patterns which keep us tied to
suffering.
<!--l. 43382--><p class="indent" >   Since the most fundamental factor in the bondage of the ego is ignorance,
to reach this new perspective ignorance must be eliminated. To eliminate
ignorance it is not sufficient merely to observe rules of conduct, to generate faith,
devotion and virtue, or even to develop a calm and concentrated mind. All
these are requisites to be sure, essential and powerful aids along the path,
but even in unison they are not enough. Something more is required, some

other element that alone can ensure the complete severing of the conditional
nexus sustaining the round of samsaric suffering. That something more is
understanding.
<!--l. 43392--><p class="indent" >   The path to liberation is essentially a path of understanding. Its core is the
knowledge and vision of things as they really are: "It is for one who knows and sees
that the destruction of the defilements takes place, not for one who does not know
and does not see." The objective domain where understanding is to be aroused is our
own experience. Since our distorted interpretations of our experience provide the food
which nourishes the process of ego, it is here, in experience, that the ego-illusion must
be dispelled. Our own experience is, of all things, that which is "closest
to ourselves," for it is through this that everything else is registered and
known. And yet, though so close, our own experience is at the same time
shrouded in darkness, its true characteristics hidden from our awareness by the
screen of ignorance. The Buddha&#8217;s Teaching is the key which helps us to
correct our understanding, enabling us to see things as they are. It is the light
which dispels the darkness of ignorance, so that we can understand our own
understanding of things "just as a man with eyes might see forms illuminated by a
lamp."
<!--l. 43410--><p class="indent" >   The correct understanding of experience takes place in the context of meditation.
It requires the development of insight (vipassana) based on a foundation of
meditative calm (samatha). No amount of merely intellectual knowledge can replace
the need for personal realization. Because our tendency to misconceive phenomena
persists through a blindness to their true nature, only the elimination of this
blindness through direct vision can rectify our erroneous patterns of cognition.
The practice of Buddhist meditation is not a way of dissolving our sense of
individual identity in some undifferentiated absolute or of withdrawing into the
bliss of a self-contained interiority. It is, rather, a way of understanding the
nature of things through the portal where that nature is most accessible to
ourselves, namely, our own processes of body and of mind. The practice of
meditation has profound effects upon our sense of identity; the alterations it
produces, however, do not come about by subordinating the intelligence to some
uncritically accepted generalization, but through a detached, sober and exhaustive
scrutiny of the experiential field that provides the locus for our sense of
identity.
<!--l. 43429--><p class="indent" >   The focal method of the practice of meditation is reflective awareness, a bending
back of the beam of awareness upon itself in order to illuminate the true
characteristics of existence implicated in each occasion of cognition. The path
of understanding unfolds in three successive stages called "the three full
understandings." In the first stage, the "full understanding of the known"
(natapariñña), the domain of experience is broken down by meditative analysis into
its constituting factors, which are then carefully defined in terms of their salient
qualities and functions. The categories employed in this operation are the key terms
in the Buddhist analysis of personality &#8212; the aggregates (khandha), sense bases
(ayatana), and elements (dhatu). The purpose of this dissection is to dispel the
illusion of substantiality that hovers over our gross perception of our experience. By
revealing that what common sense takes to be a solid monolithic whole is in reality a

conglomeration of discrete factors, the contemplation deprives the sense of
self-identification of its chief support, the notion of the ego as a simple unity. The
factors which emerge from this analytical investigation are then correlated
with their causes and conditions, disclosing their contingency and lack of
independence.
<!--l. 43450--><p class="indent" >   The second stage of understanding is the "full understanding of scrutinization"
(tiranapariñña). At this stage the experiential field is examined, not as before in
terms of its individuating features, but by way of its universal marks. These universal
marks are three: impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha) and non-self (anatta).
Under the limitations of ordinary cognition, phenomena are apprehended as
permanent, pleasurable and self. In the contemplative situation these assumptions
must be corrected, replaced by the perception of phenomena as impermanent,
unpleasurable and non-self. The task of the meditative process, at this level, is to
ascribe these qualities to the material and mental processes, and to attempt to view
all phenomena in their light.
<!--l. 43463--><p class="indent" >   When the second stage is fully mature, it gives way gradually to the third type of
comprehension, the "full understanding of abandonment" (pahanapariñña). Here the
momentary insights achieved at the previous level blossom into full penetrations.
Impermanence, suffering and selflessness are no longer merely understood as qualities
of phenomena, but are seen with complete clarity as the nature of phenomena
themselves. These realizations bring about the final abandonment of the deluded
perceptions as well as the destruction of the ego-tainted emotions which cluster
around them.
<!--l. 43473--><p class="indent" >   To walk the path of understanding is to begin to see through the deceptions
which have held our imaginations captive through the long stretch of beginningless
time. It is to outgrow our passions and prejudices, and to cast off the mask of false
identities we are accustomed to assume, the vast array of identities that constitute
our wandering in samsaric existence. The path is not an easy one, but calls for great
effort and personal integrity. Its reward lies in the happiness of growing freedom
which accompanies each courageous step, and the ultimate emancipation which lies
at the end.
