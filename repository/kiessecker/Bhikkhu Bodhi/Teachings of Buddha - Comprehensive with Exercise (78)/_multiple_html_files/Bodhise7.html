<!--l. 42102--><p class="indent" >   An ancient maxim found in the Dhammapada sums up the practice of the
Buddha&#8217;s teaching in three simple guidelines to training: to abstain from all evil, to
cultivate good, and to purify one&#8217;s mind. These three principles form a graded
sequence of steps progressing from the outward and preparatory to the inward and
essential. Each step leads naturally into the one that follows it, and the culmination
of the three in purification of mind makes it plain that the heart of Buddhist practice
is to be found here.
<!--l. 42111--><p class="indent" >   Purification of mind as understood in the Buddha&#8217;s teaching is the sustained
endeavor to cleanse the mind of defilements, those dark unwholesome mental forces
which run beneath the surface stream of consciousness vitiating our thinking, values,
attitudes, and actions. The chief among the defilements are the three that the
Buddha has termed the "roots of evil" &#8212; greed, hatred, and delusion &#8212; from which
emerge their numerous offshoots and variants: anger and cruelty, avarice and envy,
conceit and arrogance, hypocrisy and vanity, the multitude of erroneous
views.
<!--l. 42122--><p class="indent" >   Contemporary attitudes do not look favorably upon such notions as defilement
and purity, and on first encounter they may strike us as throwbacks to an outdated
moralism, valid perhaps in an era when prudery and taboo were dominant, but
having no claims upon us emancipated torchbearers of modernity. Admittedly, we do
not all wallow in the mire of gross materialism and many among us seek our
enlightenments and spiritual highs, but we want them on our own terms, and as heirs
of the new freedom we believe they are to be won through an unbridled quest for
experience without any special need for introspection, personal change, or
self-control.
<!--l. 42133--><p class="indent" >   However, in the Buddha&#8217;s teaching the criterion of genuine enlightenment
lies precisely in purity of mind. The purpose of all insight and enlightened
understanding is to liberate the mind from the defilements, and Nibbana
itself, the goal of the teaching, is defined quite clearly as freedom from greed,
hatred, and delusion. From the perspective of the Dhamma defilement and
purity are not mere postulates of a rigid authoritarian moralism but real and
solid facts essential to a correct understanding of the human situation in the
world.
<!--l. 42142--><p class="indent" >   As facts of lived experience, defilement and purity pose a vital distinction having
a crucial significance for those who seek deliverance from suffering. They represent
the two points between which the path to liberation unfolds &#8212; the former

its problematic and starting point, the latter its resolution and end. The
defilements, the Buddha declares, lie at the bottom of all human suffering. Burning
within as lust and craving, as rage and resentment, they lay to waste hearts,
lives, hopes, and civilizations, and drive us blind and thirsty through the
round of birth and death. The Buddha describes the defilements as bonds,
fetters, hindrances, and knots; thence the path to unbonding, release, and
liberation, to untying the knots, is at the same time a discipline aimed at inward
cleansing.
<!--l. 42155--><p class="indent" >   The work of purification must be undertaken in the same place where the
defilements arise, in the mind itself, and the main method the Dhamma offers for
purifying the mind is meditation. Meditation, in the Buddhist training, is
neither a quest for self-effusive ecstasies nor a technique of home-applied
psychotherapy, but a carefully devised method of mental development &#8212;
theoretically precise and practically efficient &#8212; for attaining inner purity and
spiritual freedom. The principal tools of Buddhist meditation are the core wholesome
mental factors of energy, mindfulness, concentration, and understanding.
But in the systematic practice of meditation, these are strengthened and
yoked together in a program of self-purification which aims at extirpating the
defilements root and branch so that not even the subtlest unwholesome stirrings
remain.
<!--l. 42169--><p class="indent" >   Since all defiled states of consciousness are born from ignorance, the most deeply
embedded defilement, the final and ultimate purification of mind is to be
accomplished through the instrumentality of wisdom, the knowledge and vision of
things as they really are. Wisdom, however, does not arise through chance
or random good intentions, but only in a purified mind. Thus in order for
wisdom to come forth and accomplish the ultimate purification through the
eradication of defilements, we first have to create a space for it by developing a
provisional purification of mind &#8212; a purification which, though temporary and
vulnerable, is still indispensable as a foundation for the emergence of all liberative
insight.
<!--l. 42181--><p class="indent" >   The achievement of this preparatory purification of mind begins with the
challenge of self-understanding. To eliminate defilements we must first learn to know
them, to detect them at work infiltrating and dominating our everyday thoughts and
lives. For countless eons we have acted on the spur of greed, hatred, and
delusion, and thus the work of self-purification cannot be executed hastily, in
obedience to our demand for quick results. The task requires patience, care,
and persistence &#8212; and the Buddha&#8217;s crystal clear instructions. For every
defilement the Buddha in his compassion has given us the antidote, the
method to emerge from it and vanquish it. By learning these principles and
applying them properly, we can gradually wear away the most stubborn
inner stains and reach the end of suffering, the "taintless liberation of the
mind."
<!--l. 42195--><p class="indent" >   Publisher&#8217;s note
<!--l. 42197--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making
known the Teaching of the Buddha, which has a vital message for people of all
creeds.

<!--l. 42201--><p class="indent" >   Founded in 1958, the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets
covering a great range of topics. Its publications include accurate annotated
translations of the Buddha&#8217;s discourses, standard reference works, as well as original
contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice. These works present
Buddhism as it truly is &#8212; a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds
for the past 2500 years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first
arose.
