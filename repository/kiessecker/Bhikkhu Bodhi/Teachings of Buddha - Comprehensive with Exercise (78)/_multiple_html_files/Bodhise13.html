<!--l. 45188--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 45190--><p class="indent" >   Among the hordes of animals that roam the wild, whether the jungle, the
mountains or the plain, the lion is universally recognized to be their chief. The living
embodiment of self-possessed power, he is the most regal in manner and deportment,
the mightiest, the foremost with respect to speed, courage and dominion. The
expression of the lion&#8217;s supremacy is its roar &#8212; a roar which reduces to silence the
cries, howls, bellows, shrieks, barks and growls of lesser creatures. When the lion
steps forth from his den and sounds his roar, all the other animals stop and listen.
On such an occasion none dares even to sound its own cry, let alone to come into the
open and challenge the fearless, unsurpassable roar of the golden-maned king of
beasts.
<!--l. 45202--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha&#8217;s discourses, as found in the ancient Pali canon, frequently draw
their imagery from the rich and varied animal life of the luxuriant Indian

jungle. It is thus not surprising that when the Buddha has occasion to refer to
himself, he chooses to represent himself as the stately lion and to describe his
proclamation of the Dhamma, bold and thunderous, as a veritable lion&#8217;s roar in the
spiritual domain. The Majjhima Nikaya, the Collection of Middle Length
Discourses, contains two suttas which bear this metaphor in their title. These
two &#8212; No. 11 and No. 12 in the collection &#8212; are called respectively the
Shorter Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s Roar and the Great Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s
Roar. The variation in their titles, signalled by the Pali words cula, "minor,"
and maha, "great," evidently refers at one level to their different lengths,
the one being four pages in the Pali, the other sixteen. At another level,
these different designations may allude to the relative weight of the subject
matter with which they deal, the "great" discourse being a rare revelation
by the Buddha of his exalted spiritual endowments and all-encompassing
knowledge, which entitle him to "roar his lion&#8217;s roar" in the assemblies of human
beings and gods. Still, both suttas, as their controlling image suggests, are
of paramount importance. Each delivers in its own way an eloquent and
inspiring testimony to the uniquely emancipating nature of the Buddha&#8217;s
Teaching and the peerless stature of the Teacher among the spiritual guides of
humanity.
<!--l. 45227--><p class="indent" >   The Pali Commentaries explain that there are two kinds of lion&#8217;s roar: that of the
Buddha himself and that of his disciples. The former is sounded when the Buddha
extols his own attainments or proclaims the potency of the doctrine he has realized;
the latter, when accomplished disciples testify to their own achievement of the final
goal, the fruit of arahantship. Viewed in the light of this distinction, the Shorter
Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s Roar exhibits a hybrid character, being a sutta spoken by
the Buddha to instruct his disciples how they should affirm, in discussions
with others who hold different convictions, the singular greatness of the
Teaching.
<!--l. 45238--><p class="indent" >   Section 2. The Buddha opens the discourse by disclosing the content of this roar.
He tells his monks that they can boldly declare that "only here" (idh&#8217;eva) &#8212; i.e., in
the Dispensation of the Enlightened One &#8212; is it possible to find true recluses of the
first, second, third and fourth degrees. The expression "recluse" (samana) here
refers elliptically to the four grades of noble disciples who have reached the
stages of realization at which final deliverance from suffering is irrevocably
assured: the stream-enterer, the once-returner, the non-returner and the
arahant. The "doctrines of others" (parappavada), the Buddha says, are devoid
of true recluses, of those who stand on these elevated planes. In order to
understand this statement properly, it is important to distinguish exactly what the
words imply and what they do not imply. The words do not mean that other
religions are destitute of persons of saintly stature. Such religions may well
engender individuals who have attained to a high degree of spiritual purity &#8212;
beings of noble character, lofty virtue, deep contemplative experience, and
rich endowment with love and compassion. These religions, however, would
not be capable of giving rise to ariyan individuals, those equipped with the
penetrative wisdom that can cut through the bonds that fetter living beings to
samsara, the round of repeated birth and death. For such wisdom can only be

engendered on a basis of right view &#8212; the view of the three characteristics of all
conditioned phenomena, of dependent arising, and of the Four Noble Truths
&#8212; and that view is promulgated exclusively in the fold of the Buddha&#8217;s
Dispensation.
<!--l. 45265--><p class="indent" >   Admittedly, this claim poses an unmistakable challenge to eclectic and
universalist approaches to understanding the diversity of humankind&#8217;s religious
beliefs, but it in no way implies a lack of tolerance or good will. During the time of
the Buddha himself, in the Ganges Valley, there thrived a whole panoply of religious
teachings, all of which proposed, with a dazzling diversity of doctrines and practices,
to show seekers of truth the path to liberating knowledge and to spiritual perfection.
In his frequent meetings with uncommitted inquirers and with convinced
followers of other creeds, the Buddha displayed the most complete tolerance and
gracious cordiality. But though he was always ready to allow each individual to
form his or her own convictions without the least constraint or coercion, he
clearly did not subscribe to the universalist thesis that all religions teach
essentially the same message, nor did he allow that the attainment of final
release from suffering, Nibbana, was accessible to those who stood outside the
fold of his own Dispensation. While this position may seem narrow and
parochial to many today, when reaction against the presumptions of dogmatic
religion has become so prevalent, it is not maintained by the Buddha as a
hidebound dogma or from motives of self-exalting pride, but from a clear and
accurate discernment of the precise conditions required for the attainment of
deliverance.
<!--l. 45287--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha&#8217;s statement on this issue emerges in at least two important passages
in the Canon, each of which reveals, from a slightly different angle, exactly
what those conditions are. One is found in the Maha-parinibbana Sutta (DN
16/ii,151-52). While the Buddha was lying between the twin sal trees on
the eve of his demise, a wandering ascetic named Subhadda came into his
presence to resolve a doubt: he wished to know whether or not the other great
religious teachers contemporary with the Buddha, who were regarded as
saints by the multitude, had actually attained spiritual realization, as they
claimed to have done. The Buddha shifted the burden of the discussion away
from a question aimed at assessing particular individuals and rephrased
it in terms of a general evaluative principle. He declared: "In whatsoever
Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found, there one
cannot find true recluses of the four degrees of liberation. But in whatever
Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found, there one can find
the four types of true recluses." Then the Buddha imparted to Subhadda
the information that was important for him to know: "In this Dhamma
and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found, and in it alone are found
also the true recluses of the four degrees. Outside this Dispensation the
four types of enlightened individuals are not to be found. The doctrines of
others are devoid of true recluses." In this passage the thrust of the Buddha&#8217;s
explanation points to a particular method of practice as essential to the attainment
of true realization. That method of practice is the training in the Noble
Eightfold Path, and because this path, in its fullness and perfection, is unique to

the Dispensation of a Fully Enlightened One, it follows that persons who
have reached the planes of deliverance are unique to his Dispensation as
well.
<!--l. 45316--><p class="indent" >   In the Shorter Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s Roar the reason for the Buddha&#8217;s
exclusivistic claim does not focus upon practice but upon doctrine, upon the
understanding of the nature of reality that separates his own Dhamma from all other
attempts to comprehend the human situation. As the argument unfolds, the Buddha
will show that the essential key to liberation, the key that he alone makes available,
is the teaching of anatta, of non-self or egolessness, which is at the same time the
boundary line that marks the difference between his own doctrine and the doctrines
of other teachers.
<!--l. 45326--><p class="indent" >   Sections 3-4. After announcing the "lion&#8217;s roar" in Section 2, in the next section
the Buddha begins to construct an imaginary dialogue between "the wanderers of
other sects," i.e., the proponents of the rival religious systems, and his own ordained
disciples, the bhikkhus. In the first stage of the discussion, the wanderers ask the
bhikkhus about the grounds on which they advance their seemingly sweeping claim.
The Buddha advises the monks that they should answer by mentioning four
reasons: that they have confidence in the Teacher, they have confidence in his
Teaching, they have fulfilled the precepts of training, and their co-religionists,
both monastic and lay, live together in cordial harmony. The wanderers,
however, do not remain satisfied with this answer, but join issue with the
bhikkhus by pointing out that the four reasons that the Buddhists have
offered are also found in their own sects. Thus there seems to be no essential
distinction between them that the bhikkhus can appeal to as the basis for their
thesis.
<!--l. 45343--><p class="indent" >   Section 5. The Buddha does not meet this challenge with a direct reply, but
instead approaches it via an indirect route. He enters upon this route by first
clarifying, through questioning of the wanderers, the criteria of a truly emancipating
teaching. As a matter of mutual consensus both the bhikkhus and the wanderers
agree that such a teaching must posit a goal that can be attained only by those who
have achieved complete purification: freedom from lust, hate and delusion, from
craving and clinging, from arbitrary prejudices ("favoring and opposing"), and from
the coils of "proliferation" (papañca), i.e., thought constructions born of craving and
groundless speculation.
<!--l. 45355--><p class="indent" >   Although the bhikkhus and the wanderers both agree on these criteria, this does
not suffice to establish that they are shared equally by the different spiritual systems,
nor does this imply that they are capable of being fulfilled regardless of the specific
doctrine to which one subscribes or the discipline in which one trains. To show,
again in an indirect manner, that the outside systems are not capable of
leading to final liberation, the Buddha points out that there are two broad
"families" of views, diametrically opposed to each other, under which the
wide diversity of speculative systems can be subsumed. These two views are
called, in the sutta, the view of being (bhavaditthi) and the view of non-being
(vibhavaditthi). The view of being is identical with eternalism (sassatavada),
the positing of some eternal entity or spiritual principle, i.e., a substantial
self or soul, as the essence of the individual, and the positing of an eternal

entity, such as a creator God or metaphysical Absolute, as the ground or
source of the objective universe. The view of non-being is identical with
annihilationism (ucchedavada), the repudiation of any principle of continuity
beyond death and the denial of an objective, transpersonal foundation for
morality.
<!--l. 45375--><p class="indent" >   While those who adhere to the former view do concur with the Buddhists in
accepting the efficacy of spiritual practice, their teachings, according to the Buddha,
are not free of an erroneous grasp of actuality. They spring from a deep clinging to
the notion of a permanent self, which issues in an edifice of doctrine designed to
substantiate that idea and guarantee the immortality of the imagined self. Hence the
Buddha traces this view to its root in the craving for being (bhavatanha), and he
maintains that those who adopt such a view are for that very reason the victims,
even though unwittingly, of craving and attachment. The view of non-being, on
the other hand, arises from an attitude of contempt towards existence, and
finds its root in the craving for non-being (vibhavatanha). The thinkers who
adopt this view generally begin, as the Buddha does, by recognizing the
pervasive nature of suffering; but instead of pursuing this suffering back to its
true causes, they rush to an unwarranted extreme by declaring that the
entire life-process comes to an absolute end with the breakup of the body at
death, so that at death a being is annihilated and exists no more in any
way.
<!--l. 45394--><p class="indent" >   Having isolated these two views and shown them in their mutual opposition, the
Buddha then states that any "recluses or brahmans," i.e., spiritual teachers, who
do not understand these views as they really are fail to measure up to the
criteria of those who have achieved the final goal. They are still subject
to lust, hatred and delusion, to craving and clinging, etc., and thus they
cannot claim to be freed from the cycle of repeated birth and death. Only
those who have comprehended these views, who see their dangers and have
relinquished them, are accessible to the right view that leads beyond all
erroneous extremes, and it is by the instrumentality of that view that they are
capable of cutting off the defilements and arriving at release from the samsaric
round.
<!--l. 45407--><p class="indent" >   Sections 9-15. Even at this point, however, the Buddha has not yet explicitly
shown that liberation from cyclic existence is an exclusive prerogative of his own
Dispensation. He has only left this conclusion as an inference for those who are
already aware that his Dhamma makes known the middle way that transcends
extremist views. In the present sequence, however, he will bring his argument to its
conclusion by homing in on the crucial point that separates his own teaching from
all other religious and philosophical systems. He takes up this task by way
of an examination of the mental activity of clinging (upadana). He states
that there are four kinds of clinging: (1) clinging to sense pleasures; (2)
clinging to speculative views regarding the self and the world; (3) clinging to
rules and observances, i.e., to external rules, rituals and austerities in the
belief that they lead to liberation; (4) and clinging to a doctrine of self,
i.e., to a view of a truly existent self. The last type of clinging, the subtlest
and most elusive of the group, is tantamount to what the texts refer to as

"personality view" (sakkayaditthi): the view of a substantial self taken to
be either identical in some way to the five aggregates that constitute the
personality, or to stand in some relationship to those aggregates (see MN 44/i,300,
etc.).
<!--l. 45428--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha next points out that the recluses and brahmans who propose a path
to liberation all declare that they propound "the full understanding of all kinds of
clinging," a phrase the commentary to the sutta glosses as meaning the
overcoming(samatikkama) of all kinds of clinging. However, the Buddha says, in spite
of this claim, the other spiritual teachers recognize and attack only a limited number
of the forms of clinging; at best, they might teach the overcoming of the first three
forms of clinging. What they cannot teach, because they have not comprehended this
for themselves, is the overcoming of clinging to a doctrine of self, and it is this
fourth type of clinging that vitiates even the aspects of their teachings that
are wholesome and praiseworthy. Because they perceive the dangers in the
grosser types of clinging, they might urge their disciples to relinquish them,
to give up sensuality, dogmatism and ritualism, and to cultivate in their
place renunciation, detachment and equanimity. Thereby they can enjoin
their disciples to engage in virtuous courses of spiritual practice, courses
which have the potency to generate superior states of rebirth within the
round of samsara. However, what they have not discovered, because of the
insurmountable limits to their range of understanding, is the buried root
of the entire cycle of repeated existence, which consists precisely in that
adherence to the notion of self. For this reason, the Buddha maintains, such a
Dhamma and Discipline cannot show the way to the uprooting of the belief in
self, and he therefore concludes that it is "unemancipating, unconducive to
peace" &#8212; the final peace of Nibbana. Being taught by one who is not a Fully
Enlightened Buddha, such a system does not merit the confidence of those who
can be satisfied with nothing less than complete release from all samsaric
suffering.
<!--l. 45457--><p class="indent" >   In contrast to other spiritual teachers, the Buddha continues, he himself, the
Tathagata, describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging, inclusive of the
clinging to a doctrine of self. Recognizing the danger in views of self, aware that all
such views, no matter how lofty, are undermined by a fundamental cognitive error, he
proclaims a path that leads to the eradication of views of self in all their
bewildering variety. Hence, the Buddha says, his Dhamma and Discipline is
truly emancipating, truly capable of leading to final peace, promulgated
by a Fully Enlightened One, the proper field of confidence for seekers of
liberation.
<!--l. 45468--><p class="indent" >   Sections 16-17. In the final sections of the discourse, the Buddha will validate his
claim regarding the emancipating quality of his Dispensation by showing how a
disciple who undertakes the practice of his teaching can reach the fruit of final
deliverance. He first takes up the four kinds of clinging, the subject around which the
preceding portion of the exposition revolved, and connects this topic with another
major principle of his doctrine, dependent arising (paticca samuppada). By applying
the principle of dependent arising, he traces clinging to its source in craving, and
then, continuing this line of inquiry, he pursues the entire sequence of conditional

factors at the base of samsara back to its deepest and most pernicious root, ignorance
(avijja).
<!--l. 45481--><p class="indent" >   In the final paragraph he introduces a bhikkhu who arrives at the culmination
of the path: one who develops wisdom to the fullest extent, abandons all
ignorance, and arouses the liberating knowledge. Such a one no longer clings
through any kind of clinging: he has eradicated all four types of clinging,
including the clinging to a doctrine of self, and with their eradication has
attained the final goal, the personal realization of Nibbana right in this very
life.
<!--l. 45489--><p class="indent" >   Majjhima Nikaya No. 11: The Shorter Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s Roar (Cula-sihanada
Sutta)
<!--l. 45492--><p class="indent" >   1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi
in Jeta&#8217;s Grove, Anathapindika&#8217;s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus
thus: "Bhikkhus." &#8212; "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said
this:
<!--l. 45498--><p class="indent" >   2. "Bhikkhus, only here is there a recluse, only here a second recluse, only
here a third recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The doctrines of others are
devoid[*p.64] of recluses: that is how you should rightly roar your lion&#8217;s
roar.1
<!--l. 45503--><p class="indent" >   3. "It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might ask: &#8217;But on the
strength of what (argument) or with the support of what (authority) do the
venerable ones say thus?&#8217; Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in
this way: &#8217;Friends, four things have been declared to us by the Blessed One who
knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened; on seeing these in ourselves we
say thus: "Only here is there a recluse, only here a second recluse, only here a third
recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The doctrines of others are devoid of recluses."
What are the four? We have confidence in the Teacher, we have confidence in the
Dhamma, we have fulfilled the precepts, and our companions in the Dhamma are
dear and agreeable to us whether they are layfolk or those gone forth. These
are the four things declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened, on seeing which in ourselves we say as we
do.&#8217;

friends, is that goal for one who favors and opposes, or for one who does not

goal is for one who does not favor and oppose, not for one who favors and
opposes.&#8217;3 &#8212; &#8217;But, friends is that goal for one who delights in and enjoys

<!--l. 45680--><p class="indent" >   1.Comy. explains "lion&#8217;s roar" (sihanada) as meaning a supreme roar
(setthanada), a fearless roar (abhitanada), and a roar which cannot be confuted
(appatinada). It adds: The roar about the existence of these four types of recluse only
here is the supreme roar. The absence of any fear on account of others when one
advances such a claim makes it a fearless roar. As none of the rival teachers can rise
up and say, "These recluses also exist in our Dispensation," it is a roar which cannot
be confuted.2.Comy.: Even though the adherents of other sects all declare
arahantship &#8212; understood in a general sense as spiritual perfection &#8212; to be the
goal, they point to other attainments as the goal in accordance with their
views. Thus the brahmans declare the Brahma-world to be the goal, the
great ascetics declare the gods of Streaming Radiance, the wanderers the
gods of Refulgent Glory, and the Ajivakas the non-percipient state, which
they posit to be "infinite mind" (anantamanasa).3."Favoring and opposing"
(anurodha-pativirodha): reacting with attraction through lust and with aversion
through hatred.4.Proliferation (papañca), according to Comy., generally
means mental activity governed by craving, conceit and views, but here
only craving and views are intended.5.The adoption of one view entailing
opposition to the other links up with the earlier statement that the goal is for one
who does not favor and oppose.6.Comy. mentions eight conditions which
serve as the origin (samudaya) of these views: the five aggregates, ignorance,
contact, perception, thought, unwise attention, bad friends, and the voice of
another. Their disappearance (atthangama) is the path of stream-entry, which
eradicates all wrong views. Their gratification (assada) may be understood as
the satisfaction of psychological need to which the view caters, specifically
the nurturing of craving for being by the eternalist view and of craving for

non-being by the annihilationist view. Their danger (adinava) is the continued
bondage they entail, by obstructing the acceptance of right view, which leads
to liberation. And the escape from them (nissarana) is Nibbana.7.Comy.
glosses full understanding (pariñña) here as overcoming (samatikkama), with
reference to the commentarial notion of pahanapariñña, "full understanding as
abandonment."8.This passage clearly indicates that the critical differentiating factor
of the Buddha&#8217;s Dhamma is its "full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of
self." This means, in effect, that the Buddha alone is able to show how to
overcome all views of self by developing penetration into the truth of non-self
(anatta).9.Comy.: The Buddha teaches how clinging to sense pleasures is
abandoned by the path of arahantship, while the other three types of clinging are
eliminated by the path of stream-entry. The path of stream-entry eliminates the
other three clingings because these three are all forms of wrong view, and
all wrong views are overcome at that stage. Although the statement that
clinging to sense pleasures is abandoned by the path of arahantship may sound
strange, in view of the fact that sensual desire is already eliminated by the
non-returner, the Tika (subcommentary) to the sutta explains that in the present
context the word kama, sense pleasure, should be understood to comprise all
forms of greed, and the subtler types of greed are only eliminated with the
attainment of arahantship.10.This passage is explained in order to show
how clinging is to be abandoned. Clinging is traced back, via the chain of
dependent arising, to its root-cause in ignorance, and then the destruction of
ignorance is shown to be the means to eradicate clinging.11.The Pali idiom,
n&#8217;eva kamupadanam upadiyati, would have to be rendered literally as "he
does not cling to the clinging to sense pleasures," which may obscure the
sense more than it illuminates it. The word upadana in Pali is the object of
its own verb form, while "clinging" in English is not. The easiest solution
is to translate directly in accordance with the sense rather than to try to
reproduce the idiom in translation.12.This is the stock canonical declaration of
arahantship.
<!--l. 45744--><p class="indent" >   The Great Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s Roar
<!--l. 45746--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 45748--><p class="indent" >   The Maha-sihanada Sutta, the Great Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s Roar, is a text of
awesome scope and power, one of those rare suttas in which the Buddha discloses the
greatness and loftiness of his own spiritual endowments. Towards the end of the
sutta, the Buddha says that he has reached his eightieth year, which allows us to
place the discourse in the final year of his life. Thus the sutta serves as a convenient
summation of the exalted qualities that enabled the Buddha to function so
effectively as teacher and spiritual guide through the forty-five years of his
mission.
<!--l. 45758--><p class="indent" >   It is not typical of the Buddha to extol himself, for he did not intend his
Dispensation to evolve into a personality cult centered around himself as a
charismatic and powerful leader. Throughout his ministry he constantly emphasized
the primacy of his role as guide, as the discoverer and proclaimer of the path. His
task is not to command reverence, but to steer his disciples onto and along the path,
for it is only the practice of the path, the cultivation of the training, that can effect

the deep interior purification by which one can reach the extinction of the defilements
and liberation from suffering.
<!--l. 45768--><p class="indent" >   However, while the Buddha functions primarily as the revealer of the path,
confidence in him as the Supreme Teacher remains an essential element of the
training. It is this confidence, freshly arisen, that induces the curious inquirer to
cross the great divide that separates the admirer of the Dhamma from the
practitioner, and it is this same confidence that drives the aspirant forward until
the task of self-cultivation has been completed. Frequent reflection on the
greatness of the Master inspires joy and courage, sustaining one&#8217;s commitment
during those dark periods when prospects for progress appear bleak, and
desire and doubt &#8212; those twin conspirators &#8212; combine forces to attempt to
persuade one of the futility of one&#8217;s efforts. Hence, in order to provide a spur to
awaken and nurture the confidence necessary to tread the path through its
downward turns as well as its ascents, the Buddha on occasion offers us
revelations of his "Buddha-gunas," the excellent qualities of a Fully Enlightened
One that entitle him to serve as the first of the Three Gems and Three
Refuges.
<!--l. 45785--><p class="indent" >   One of the most impressive of these rare disclosures is the Great Discourse on
the Lion&#8217;s Roar. Spoken as a rebuttal to the charges of a renegade disciple
who, in the midst of the populous city of Vesali, had been denouncing the
Buddha and attempting to dissuade others from following his teaching, the
sutta recapitulates the various distinguished qualities of the Blessed One,
with special emphasis upon his "ten Tathagata powers" (tathagatabala) and
"four intrepidities" (vesarajja); the sutta also affords us a glimpse of the
demanding ordeal he underwent over many past aeons seeking the path
to deliverance. When it was first spoken, the sutta had such a powerful
impact on one monk in the assembly that his bodily hairs stood on end,
and thus, during an early period, the sutta was known by the alternative
title "The Hair-raising Discourse." Even today, centuries later, the Great
Discourse on the Lion&#8217;s Roar can continue to serve as a fecund source of
inspiration.

<!--l. 45804--><p class="indent" >   1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesali in the
grove outside the city to the west.
<!--l. 45807--><p class="indent" >   2. Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, had recently left this
Dhamma and Discipline.1 He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly:
"The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.2 The recluse Gotama
teaches a Dhamma (merely) hammered out by reasoning, following his own
line of inquiry as it occurs to him, and when he teaches the Dhamma to
anyone, it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of
suffering."3
<!--l. 45816--><p class="indent" >   3. Then, when it was morning, the Venerable Sariputta dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms. Then he heard Sunakkhatta, son
of the Licchavis, making this statement before the Vesali assembly. When

he had wandered for alms in Vesali and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was
saying.
<!--l. 45824--><p class="indent" >   4. (The Blessed One said:) "Sariputta, the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angry,

<!--l. 46415--><p class="indent" >   1.The story of Sunakkhatta&#8217;s defection is found in the Patika Sutta (DN 24). He
became dissatisfied with the Buddha and left the Order because the Buddha would
not perform miracles for him or explain to him the beginning of things. He also
showed great admiration for those who engaged in self-mortification, and probably
resented the Buddha for emphasizing a "middle way" that condemned such extreme
austerities as unprofitable.2.Superhuman states (uttari manussadhamma) are states,
virtues or attainments higher than the ordinary human virtues comprised in the ten
wholesome courses of action; they include the jhanas, direct knowledges (abhiñña),
the paths and the fruits. "Distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble
ones" (alamariyañana-dassanavisesa), an expression frequently occurring in the
suttas, signifies all higher degrees of meditative knowledge characteristic of the noble
individual. In the present context, according to Comy., it means specifically the
supramundane path, which Sunakkhatta is thus denying of the Buddha.3.The thrust
of his criticism is that the Buddha teaches a doctrine that he has merely
worked out in thought rather than one he has realized through transcendental
wisdom. Apparently, Sunakkhatta believes that being led to the complete
destruction of suffering is, as a goal, inferior to the acquisition of miraculous
powers.4.All the sections to follow are intended as a rebuttal of Sunakkhatta&#8217;s
charge against the Buddha. Sections 6-8 cover the first three of the six direct
knowledges, the last three appearing as the last of the ten powers of the
Tathagata. The latter, according to Comy., are to be understood as powers of
knowledge (ñanabala) that are acquired by all Buddhas as the outcome of
their accumulations of merit. The Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka
provides an elaborate analysis of them, the gist of which will be discussed in
subsequent notes.5.Comy.: The Wheel of Brahma (brahmacakka) is the supreme,
best, most excellent wheel, the Wheel of the Dhamma (dhammacakka).
This has two aspects: the knowledge of penetration (pativedhañana) and
the knowledge of teaching (desanañana). The knowledge of penetration,
by which the Buddha penetrates the truth of the Dhamma, is produced
from wisdom and leads to the attainment of the noble fruit for himself; the
knowledge of teaching, by which the Buddha is qualified to expound the
Dhamma perfectly to others, is produced from compassion and leads others to
the attainment of the noble fruit.6.Comy. glosses thana as cause or ground
(karana) and explains: "Such and such dhammas are causes (hetu), conditions
(paccaya), for the arising of such and such dhammas: that is thana. Such and
such dhammas are not causes, not conditions, for the arising of such and

such dhammas: that is atthana. Knowing that, he understands thana as
thana and atthana as atthana (i.e., causal occasion as causal occasion, and
non-causal occasion as non-causal occasion)." Comy. also refers to the different
explanation in the Vibhanga, apparently regarding both explanations as
acceptable.
<!--l. 46462--><p class="indent" >   Vbh. Section 809 explains this knowledge with reference to MN 115 as the
Buddha&#8217;s knowledge of what is possible and what is impossible, e.g., it is impossible
that a person possessed of right view should regard any formations as permanent or
as pleasurable, or anything whatever as self, while it is possible that a worldling will
regard things in such an erroneous way. It is impossible for a person possessed
of right view to commit the five heinous crimes (matricide, parricide, the
murder of an arahant, the wounding of a Buddha, causing a schism in the
Sangha), while it is possible for a worldling to commit such crimes, etc.
etc.
<!--l. 46473--><p class="indent" >   7.Vbh. Section 810: "Herein, the Tathagata comprehends that there are some evil
actions performed which do not mature because they are prevented from maturing by
a fortunate rebirth, a fortunate body, a fortunate time, a fortunate effort, while there
are some evil actions performed which mature because of an unfortunate rebirth, etc.
There are some good actions which do not mature because of an unfortunate
rebirth, etc., while there are some good actions which mature because of a
fortunate rebirth, etc." (condensed).8.Vbh. Section 811: "Herein, the Tathagata
comprehends thus: &#8217;This is the path, this is the practice leading to hell,
to the animal realm, to the plane of ghosts, to the human realm, to the
realm of the gods, to deliverance.&#8217; " This knowledge will be elaborated upon
below in Sections 35-42.9.Vbh. Section 812: "The Tathagata comprehends
the different aggregates, the different sense bases, the different elements;
he comprehends the different worlds that have many elements, different
elements."10.Vbh. Section 813: "The Tathagata understands that beings are of
inferior inclinations and superior inclinations, and that they gravitate towards
those who share their own inclinations" (condensed).11.Vbh. Sections 814-27
gives a detailed analysis. Comy. states the meaning more concisely as the
Tathagata&#8217;s knowledge of the superiority and inferiority of beings&#8217; faculties of faith,
energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom.12.Vbh. Section 828: "The
defilement (sankilesa) is a state partaking of deterioration; cleansing (vodana) is
a state partaking of distinction; emergence (vutthana) is both cleansing
and the rising out of an attainment. The eight liberations (vimokkha) are
enumerated, e.g., at DN 15/ii,70-71, and comprise three liberations pertaining
to the realm of material form, the four immaterial attainments, and the
cessation of perception and feeling. The nine attainments (samapatti) are the
four jhanas, the four immaterial attainments, and cessation.13.The idiom
yathabhatam nikkhitto evam niraye is knotty; the rendering here follows the
gloss of Comy.: "He will be put in hell as if carried off and put there by the
wardens of hell." Although such a fate may sound excessively severe merely for
verbal denigration, it should be remembered that he is maligning a Fully
Enlightened Buddha with a mind of hatred, and his intention in so doing is to
discourage others from entering upon the path that could lead them to complete

liberation from suffering.14.The four kinds of intrepidity (vesarajja: also rendered
"grounds of self-confidence") may be divided into two pairs. The first pair
relates mainly to the internal qualities of the Buddha, his achievement of
personal perfection, while the second pair has an outward orientation, being
concerned primarily with his qualifications as a teacher. The first intrepidity
confirms his attainment of supreme enlightenment and the removal of all
obscuration regarding the range of what may be known; it points to the Buddha&#8217;s
acquisition of omniscience (sabbaññutañana). The second underlines his
complete purity through the destruction of all defilements; it points to his
achievement of the fruit of arahantship. The third means that the Buddha&#8217;s
understanding of obstructions to the goal is unimpeachable, while the fourth
confirms the efficacy of the Dhamma in accomplishing its intended purpose,
namely, leading the practitioner to complete release from suffering.15.In
later Buddhist tradition the asuras, titans or "anti-gods," are added as a
separate realm to make the "six destinations" familiar from the Tibetan
Wheel of Life.16.Comy.: Even though the description is the same as that
of the bliss of the heavenly world, the meaning is different. For the bliss
of the heavenly world is not really extremely pleasant because the fevers
of lust, etc. are still present there. But the bliss of Nibbana is extremely
pleasant in every way through the subsiding of all fevers.17.Comy. explains
that at this juncture the Buddha related this account of his past ascetic
practices because Sunakkhatta was a great admirer of extreme asceticism (as is
clear from the Patika Sutta) and the Buddha wanted to make it known that
there was no one who could equal him in the practice of austerities. Sections
44-56 apparently deal with the Bodhisatta&#8217;s striving during the six years&#8217;
period of austerities in his last existence, while Sections 57-61 refer back to
his previous existences as a seeker of enlightenment.18.The "eight-days&#8217;

December or early January.19.That is, they hold the view that beings are
