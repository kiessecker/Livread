<!--l. 62372--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 62374--><p class="indent" >   These talks &#8212; except for the two marked otherwise &#8212; were originally given for
the benefit of Mrs. Pow Panga Vathanakul, a follower of Venerable Acariya Maha
Boowa who had contracted cancer of the bone marrow and had come to practice
meditation at Wat Pa Baan Taad in order to contend with the pain of the disease
and the fact of her approaching death. All in all, she stayed at Wat Pa Baan Taad for
102 days, from November 9, 1975 to February 19, 1976; during that period Venerable
Acariya Maha Boowa gave 84 impromptu talks for her benefit, all of which were tape
recorded.
<!--l. 62384--><p class="indent" >   After her death in September, 1976, one of her friends, M.R. Sermsri
Kasemsri, asked permission of the Venerable Acariya to transcribe the talks and
print them in book form. Seventy-seven of the talks, plus an additional eight
talks given on other occasions, were thus printed in two massive volumes
together totaling more than 1,000 pages. Six talks from these two volumes have

already been translated into English and published in a book entitled Amata
Dhamma.
<!--l. 62392--><p class="indent" >   The talks in the present collection all deal with the practice of meditation, and
particularly with the development of discernment. Because their style of presentation
is personal and impromptu, they will probably be best understood if read in
conjunction with a more systematic introduction to the techniques of meditation,
such as the Venerable Acariya&#8217;s own book, Wisdom Develops Samadhi, which is
available separately or as part of the volume, Forest Dhamma.
<!--l. 62400--><p class="indent" >   The title of the present book is taken from a request, frequently made by the
Venerable Acariya to his listeners, that his teachings be taken to heart, because they
come straight from the heart.
<!--l. 62404--><p class="indent" >   Thanissaro BhikkhuRayong June, 1987
<!--l. 62406--><p class="indent" >   In these talks, as in Thai usage in general, the words &#8217;heart&#8217; and &#8217;mind&#8217; are used
interchangeably.
<!--l. 62409--><p class="indent" >   The Language of the Heart
<!--l. 62411--><p class="indent" >   The Venerable Acariya Mun taught that all hearts have the same language. No
matter what one&#8217;s language or nationality, the heart has nothing but simple
awareness, which is why he said that all hearts have the same language. When a
thought arises, we understand it, but when we put it into words, it has to become
this or that language, so that we don&#8217;t really understand one another. The feelings
within the heart, though, are the same for everyone. This is why the Dhamma
fits the heart perfectly, because the Dhamma isn&#8217;t any particular language.
The Dhamma is the language of the heart. The Dhamma resides with the
heart.
<!--l. 62422--><p class="indent" >   Pleasure and pain reside with the heart. The acts that create pleasure and pain
are thought up by the heart. The heart is what knows the results that appear as
pleasure and pain; and the heart is burdened with the outcome of its own thoughts.
This is why the heart and the Dhamma fit perfectly. No matter what our language or
nationality, we can all understand the Dhamma because the heart and the Dhamma
are a natural pair.
<!--l. 62430--><p class="indent" >   The heart forms the core within the body. It&#8217;s the core, the substance, the
primary essence within the body. It&#8217;s the basic foundation. The conditions that arise
from the mind, such as thought-formations, appear and vanish, again and again. Here
I&#8217;m referring to the rippling of the mind. When the mind ripples, that&#8217;s the formation
of a thought. Labels, which deal with conjecturing, memorizing, and recognizing, are
termed sañña. &#8217;Long&#8217; thoughts are sañña; short thoughts are sankhara. In
other words, when a thought forms &#8212; &#8217;blip&#8217; &#8212; that&#8217;s a sankhara.Sañña
refers to labeling and recognizing. Viññana refers to the act of taking note
when anything external comes and makes contact with the senses, as when
visible forms make contact with the eye and cognition results. All of these
things are constantly arising and vanishing of their own accord, and so the
Buddha called them khandhas. Each &#8217;heap&#8217; or &#8217;group&#8217; is called a khandha.
These five heaps of khandhas are constantly arising and vanishing all the
time.
<!--l. 62446--><p class="indent" >   Even arahants have these same conditions &#8212; just like ordinary people everywhere
&#8212; the only difference being that the arahants&#8217; khandhas are khandhas pure and

simple, without any defilements giving them orders, making them do this or think
that. Instead, their khandhas think out of their own free nature, with nothing
forcing them to think this or that, unlike the minds of ordinary people in
general.
<!--l. 62454--><p class="indent" >   To make a comparison, the khandhas of ordinary people are like prisoners,
constantly being ordered about. Their various thoughts, labels, assumptions, and
interpretations have something that orders and forces them to appear, making them
think, assume, and interpret in this way or that. In other words, they have
defilements as their boss, their leader, ordering them to appear.
<!--l. 62461--><p class="indent" >   Arahants, however, don&#8217;t. When a thought forms, it simply forms. Once it forms,
it simply disappears. There&#8217;s no seed to continue it, no seed to weigh the mind
down, because there&#8217;s nothing to force it, unlike the khandhas governed by
defilements or under the leadership of defilements. This is where the difference
lies.
<!--l. 62467--><p class="indent" >   But their basic nature is the same: All the khandhas we have mentioned are
inconstant (aniccam). In other words, instability and changeability are a
regular part of their nature, beginning with the rupa khandha, our body,
and the vedana khandha, feelings of pleasure, pain, and indifference. These
things appear and vanish, again and again. Sañña, sankhara, and viññana are
also always in a state of appearing and vanishing as a normal part of their
nature.
<!--l. 62475--><p class="indent" >   But as for actual awareness &#8212; which forms the basis of our knowledge of the
various things that arise and vanish &#8212; that doesn&#8217;t vanish. We can say that the mind
can&#8217;t vanish. We can say that the mind can&#8217;t arise. A mind that has been purified
thus has no more problems concerning the birth and death of the body and the
khandhas; and thus there is no more birth here and there, appearing in crude forms
such as individuals or as living beings, for those whose minds have been
purified.
<!--l. 62484--><p class="indent" >   But those whose minds are not purified: They are the ones who take birth and
die, setting their sights on cemeteries without end, all because of this undying
mind.
<!--l. 62488--><p class="indent" >   This is why the Lord Buddha taught the world, and in particular the world of
human beings, who know right and wrong, good and evil; who know how to foster the
one and remedy the other; who understand the language of the Dhamma he taught.
This is why he taught the human world above and beyond the other worlds: so that
we could try to remedy the things that are harmful and detrimental, removing them
from our thoughts, words, and deeds; try to nourish and foster whatever goodness
we might already have, and give rise to whatever goodness we don&#8217;t yet
have.
<!--l. 62498--><p class="indent" >   He taught us to foster and develop the goodness we already have so as to nourish
the heart, giving it refreshment and well-being, giving it a standard of quality, or
goodness, so that when it leaves its present body to head for whatever place or level
of being, this mind that has been constantly nourished with goodness will be a good
mind. Wherever it fares, it will fare well. Wherever it takes birth, it will be born well.
Wherever it lives, it will live well. It will keep on experiencing well-being and
happiness until it gains the capacity, the potential, the accumulation of merit

it has developed progressively from the past into the present &#8212; in other
words, yesterday is today&#8217;s past, today is tomorrow&#8217;s past, all of which are
days in which we have fostered and developed goodness step by step &#8212;
to the point where the mind has the firm strength and ability, from the
supporting power of this goodness, that enables it to pass over and gain
release.
<!--l. 62514--><p class="indent" >   Such a mind has no more birth, not even in the most quiet or refined levels of
being that contain any latent traces of conventional reality (sammati) &#8212; namely,
birth and death as we currently experience it. Such a mind goes completely beyond
all such things. Here I&#8217;m referring to the minds of the Buddhas and of the
arahants.
<!--l. 62520--><p class="indent" >   There&#8217;s a story about Ven. Vangisa that has a bearing on this. Ven. Vangisa,
when he was a layman, was very talented in divining the level of being in which the
mind of a dead person was reborn &#8212; no matter who the person was. You couldn&#8217;t
quite say he was a fortuneteller. Actually he was more a master of psychic skills.
When anyone died, he would take that person&#8217;s skull and knock on it &#8212;
knock! knock! knock! &#8212; focus his mind, and then know that this person
was reborn there, that person was reborn here. If the person was reborn
in hell or in heaven, as a common animal or a hungry ghost, he could tell
in every case, without any hesitation. All he needed was to knock on the
skull.
<!--l. 62532--><p class="indent" >   When he heard his friends say that the Buddha was many times more
talented than this, he wanted to expand on his knowledge. So he went to
the Buddha&#8217;s presence to ask for further training in this science. When he
reached the Buddha, the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant to knock
on.
<!--l. 62538--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;All right, see if you can tell where he was reborn.&#8217;
<!--l. 62540--><p class="indent" >   Ven. Vangisa knocked on the skull and listened.
<!--l. 62542--><p class="indent" >   Silence.
<!--l. 62544--><p class="indent" >   He knocked again and listened.
<!--l. 62546--><p class="indent" >   Silence.
<!--l. 62548--><p class="indent" >   He thought for a moment.
<!--l. 62550--><p class="indent" >   Silence.
<!--l. 62552--><p class="indent" >   He focused his mind.
<!--l. 62554--><p class="indent" >   Silence.
<!--l. 62556--><p class="indent" >   He couldn&#8217;t see where the owner of the skull was reborn. At his wit&#8217;s end, he
confessed frankly that he didn&#8217;t know where the arahant was reborn.
<!--l. 62560--><p class="indent" >   At first, Ven. Vangisa had thought himself talented and smart, and had planned
to challenge the Buddha before asking for further training. But when he reached the
Buddha, the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant to knock on &#8212; and right there
he was stymied. So now he genuinely wanted further training. Once he had further
training, he&#8217;d really be something special. This being the way things stood, he asked
to study with the Buddha. So the Buddha taught him the science, taught him the
method &#8212; in other words, the science of the Dhamma. Ven. Vangisa practiced and
practiced until finally he attained arahantship. From then on he was no longer
interested in knocking on anyone&#8217;s skull except for his own. Once he had known

clearly, that was the end of the matter. This is called &#8217;knocking on the right
skull.&#8217;
<!--l. 62574--><p class="indent" >   Once the Buddha had brought up the topic of the mind that doesn&#8217;t experience
rebirth &#8212; the skull of one whose mind was purified &#8212; no matter how many times
Ven. Vangisa knocked on it, he couldn&#8217;t know where the mind was reborn, even
though he had been very talented before, for the place of a pure mind&#8217;s rebirth
cannot be found.
<!--l. 62581--><p class="indent" >   The same was true in the case of Ven. Godhika: This story should serve as quite
some food for thought. Ven. Godhika went to practice meditation, made progress step
by step, but then regressed. They say this happened six times. After the seventh
time, he took a razor to slash his throat &#8212; he was so depressed &#8212; but then came to
his senses, contemplated the Dhamma, and became an arahant at the last minute.
That&#8217;s the story in brief. When he died, Mara&#8217;s hordes searched for his spirit. To
put it simply, they stirred up a storm, but couldn&#8217;t tell where he had been
reborn.
<!--l. 62591--><p class="indent" >   So the Lord Buddha said, &#8217;No matter how much you dig or search or investigate
to find the spirit of our son, Godhika, who has completely finished his task, you won&#8217;t
be able to find it &#8212; even if you turn the world upside down &#8212; because such a task
lies beyond the scope of conventional reality.&#8217; How could they possibly find it? It&#8217;s
beyond the capacity of people with defilements to know the power of an arahant&#8217;s
mind.
<!--l. 62599--><p class="indent" >   In the realm of convention, there is no one who can trace the path of an
arahant&#8217;s mind, because an arahant lies beyond convention, even though his is
a mind just the same. Think about it: Even our stumbling and crawling
mind, when it is continually cleansed without stop, without ceasing, without
letting perseverance lag, will gradually become more and more refined until
it reaches the limit of refinement. Then the refinement will disappear &#8212;
because refinement is a matter of conventional reality &#8212; leaving a nature of
solid gold, or solid Dhamma, called a pure mind. We too will then have no
more problems, just like the arahants, because our mind will have become
a superlative mind, just like the minds of those who have already gained
release.
<!--l. 62612--><p class="indent" >   All minds of this sort are the same, with no distinction between women and men,
which is simply a matter of sex or convention. With the mind, there is no distinction
between women and men, and thus both women and men have the same capacity in
the area of the Dhamma. Both are capable of attaining the various levels of Dhamma
all the way to release. There are no restrictions that can be imposed in this area. All
that is needed is that we develop enough ability and potential, and then we can all go
beyond.
<!--l. 62621--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, we should all make an effort to train our hearts and
minds. At the very least, we should get the mind to attain stillness and
peace with any of the meditation themes that can lull it into a state of calm,
giving rise to peace and well-being within it. For example, mindfulness of
breathing, which is one of the primary themes in meditation circles, seems to
suit the temperaments of more people than any other theme. But whatever
the theme, take it as a governing principle, a refuge, a mainstay for the

mind, putting it into practice within your own mind so as to attain rest and
peace.
<!--l. 62631--><p class="indent" >   When the mind begins to settle down, we will begin to see its essential nature and
worth. We will begin to see what the heart is and how it is. In other words, when
the mind gathers all of its currents into a single point, as simple awareness
within itself, this is what is called the &#8217;mind&#8217; (citta). The gathering in of the
mind occurs on different levels, corresponding to the mind&#8217;s ability and to
the different stages of its refinement. Even if the mind is still on a crude
level, we can nevertheless know it when it gathers inwardly. When the mind
becomes more and more refined, we will know its refinement &#8212; &#8217;This mind is
refined... This mind is radiant... This mind is extremely still... This mind is
something extremely amazing&#8217; &#8212; more and more, step by step, this very same
mind!
<!--l. 62644--><p class="indent" >   In cleansing and training the mind for the sake of stillness; in investigating,
probing, and solving the problems of the mind with discernment (pañña) &#8212; which is
the way of making the mind progress, or of enabling us to reach the truth of the
mind, step by step, through the means already mentioned &#8212; no matter how crude
the mind may be, don&#8217;t worry about it. If we get down to making the effort and
persevere continually with what diligence and persistence we have, that crudeness
will gradually fade away and vanish. Refinement will gradually appear through our
own actions or our own striving until we are able to go beyond and gain release by
slashing the defilements to bits. This holds true for all of us, men and women
alike.
<!--l. 62656--><p class="indent" >   But while we aren&#8217;t yet able to do so, we shouldn&#8217;t be anxious. All that is
asked is that we make the mind principled so that it can be a refuge and a
mainstay for itself. As for this body, we&#8217;ve been relying on it ever since
the day we were born. This is something we all can know. We&#8217;ve made it
live, lie down, urinate, defecate, work, make a living. We&#8217;ve used it, and it
has used us. We order it around, and it orders us around. For instance,
we&#8217;ve made it work, and it has made us suffer with aches here and pains
there, so that we have to search for medicine to treat it. It&#8217;s the one that
hurts, and it&#8217;s the one that searches for medicine. It&#8217;s the one that provides
the means. And so we keep supporting each other back and forth in this
way.
<!--l. 62669--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s hard to tell who is in charge, the body or us. We can order it around part of
the time, but it orders us around all the time. Illness, hunger, thirst, sleepiness: These
are all nothing but a heap of suffering and stress in which the body orders us
around, and orders us from every side. We can order it around only a little
bit, so when the time is right for us to give the orders, we should make it
meditate.
<!--l. 62676--><p class="indent" >   So. Get to work. As long as the body is functioning normally, then no matter how
much or how heavy the work, get right to it. But if the body isn&#8217;t functioning
normally, if you&#8217;re ill, you need to be conscious of what it can take. As for the mind,
though, keep up the effort within, unflaggingly, because it&#8217;s your essential
duty.
<!--l. 62682--><p class="indent" >   You&#8217;ve depended on the body for a long time. Now that it&#8217;s wearing down, know

that it&#8217;s wearing down &#8212; which parts still work, which parts no longer work. You&#8217;re
the one in charge and you know it full well, so make whatever compromises you
should.
<!--l. 62687--><p class="indent" >   But as for the heart, which isn&#8217;t ill along with the body, it should step up its
efforts within, so that it won&#8217;t lack the benefits it should gain. Make the mind have
standards and be principled &#8212; principled in its living, principled in its dying.
Wherever it&#8217;s born, make it have good principles and satisfactory standards. What
they call &#8217;merit&#8217; (puñña) won&#8217;t betray your hopes or expectations. It will provide you
with satisfactory circumstances at all times, in keeping with the fact that you&#8217;ve
accumulated the merit &#8212; the well-being &#8212; that all the world wants and of which no
one has enough. In other words, what the world wants is well-being, whatever
the sort, and in particular the well-being of the mind that will arise step
by step from having done things, such as meditation, which are noble and
good.
<!--l. 62701--><p class="indent" >   This is the well-being that forms a core or an important essence within the heart.
We should strive, then, while the body is still functioning, for when life comes to
an end, nothing more can be done. No matter how little or how much we
have accomplished, we must stop at that point. We stop our work, put it
aside, and then reap its rewards &#8212; there, in the next life. Whatever we
should be capable of doing, we do. If we can go beyond or gain release, that&#8217;s
the end of every problem. There will then be nothing to involve us in any
turmoil.
<!--l. 62710--><p class="indent" >   Here I&#8217;ve been talking about the mind because the mind is the primary issue.
That which will make us fare well or badly, meet with pleasure or pain, is nothing
else but the mind.
<!--l. 62714--><p class="indent" >   As for what they call bad kamma, it lies within the mind that has made it.
Whether or not you can remember, these seeds &#8212; which lie within the heart &#8212;
can&#8217;t be prevented from bearing fruit, because they are rooted in the mind.
You have to accept your kamma. Don&#8217;t find fault with it. Once it&#8217;s done,
it&#8217;s done, so how can you find fault with it? The hand writes and so the
hand must erase. You have to accept it like a good sport. This is the way it
is with kamma until you can gain release &#8212; which will be the end of the
problem.
<!--l. 62724--><p class="indent" >   The Marvel of the Dhamma
<!--l. 62726--><p class="indent" >   Those who practice the Dhamma will begin to know the Dhamma or to gain a
feel for the Dhamma in the area of meditation more markedly than in other areas,
and more extensively. For example, the gratification that comes from being generous
is moving in one way, the gratification that comes from maintaining the precepts is
moving in another way, the feelings of gratification that come from the different
forms of goodness are moving in their own separate ways. This is called finding
gratification in skillfulness.
<!--l. 62735--><p class="indent" >   But all of these feelings of gratification converge in the practice of meditation. We
begin to feel moved from the moment the mind begins to grow still, when the heart
gathers its currents together to stand solely on its own. Even though we
may not yet obtain a great deal of stillness from the inward gathering of
the mind, we still find ourselves gratified within, in a way we can clearly

sense. If the mind or the Dhamma were a material object, there wouldn&#8217;t be
anyone in the world who wouldn&#8217;t respect the religion, because the goodness,
the well-being, and the marvels that arise from the religion and from the
practicing in line with the teachings of the religion are things desired the world
over.
<!--l. 62747--><p class="indent" >   Goodness, well-being, marvels: These are things the world has always desired
from time immemorial &#8212; with a desire that has never lost its taste &#8212; and they are
things that will always be desired until the world loses its meaning, or until people
become extinct, having no more sense of good and evil. That&#8217;s when the world will
no longer aspire for these great blessings. The well-being that comes from the marvels
&#8212; the Dhamma in the area of its results &#8212; is something to which all living beings
aspire, simply that their abilities differ, so that some attain their aspirations, while
others don&#8217;t.
<!--l. 62758--><p class="indent" >   But the Dhamma can&#8217;t be displayed for the world to perceive with its senses of
sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch in the way other things can. Even though there
may be other immaterial phenomena similar to the Dhamma &#8212; such as smells &#8212;
still they aren&#8217;t like the true Dhamma that is touched by the hearts of those who
have practiced it. If the Dhamma could be displayed like material objects, there is no
doubt but that the human world would have to respect the religion for the sake of
that Dhamma. This is because the Dhamma is something more marvelous than
anything else. In all the three levels of existence, there is no greater marvel than in
the Dhamma.
<!--l. 62770--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma can appear as a marvel, conspicuous and clear in the mind. The
mind is what knows it &#8212; and only the mind. It can&#8217;t be displayed in general like
material objects, as when we take things out to admire or to show off to others. The
Dhamma can&#8217;t possibly be displayed like material objects. This is what makes the
world lack interest &#8212; and lack the things that could be hoped from the Dhamma &#8212;
in a way that is really a shame.
<!--l. 62778--><p class="indent" >   Even those who want the marvel of the Dhamma don&#8217;t know what the marvel is,
or what the profundity of the Dhamma is, because the mind has never had contact
with that profundity. The eye has never had contact with the marvel. The ear has
never obtained any marvel from the current of the Dhamma, because the Dhamma
can&#8217;t be displayed as a current of sound as other things can. This is one
obstacle that prevents people from becoming moved by the Dhamma, that
prevents them from fully believing and fully entrusting themselves to the
Dhamma in a way consistent with the world&#8217;s long-felt hunger for well-being and
prosperity.
<!--l. 62788--><p class="indent" >   Each of the Buddhas who has gained Awakening and taught the Dhamma to the
world has had to reflect to the full extent of his intelligence and ability on the myriad
ways of teaching the Dhamma to the world so that the world could see it
as a marvel, inasmuch as the Dhamma can&#8217;t be put in shop windows or
in public places. This is because the true Dhamma lies in the heart and
reveals itself only in words and deeds, which doesn&#8217;t excite a gratifying sense
of absorption in the same way as touching the Dhamma directly with the
heart.
<!--l. 62797--><p class="indent" >   Because there is no way to display the Dhamma directly, the Buddhas display it

indirectly through teaching. They point out the causes &#8212; the Dhamma of conduct
and practices leading to the Dhamma of results at this or that point or this or that
level; and at the same time they proclaim the results &#8212; the excellence, the marvels of
the stages and levels of the Dhamma that can be touched with the heart, all the way
to the highest marvel, vimutti, the mental release called nibbana within the
heart.
<!--l. 62806--><p class="indent" >   Every Buddha has to devise strategies in teaching the Dhamma so as to bring
that marvel out to the world by using various modes of speech and conduct
&#8212; for example, describing the Dhamma and showing the conduct of the
Dhamma as being like this and that &#8212; but the actual Dhamma can&#8217;t be shown.
It is something known exclusively in the heart, in the way in which each
Buddha and each arahant possesses this marvel. None of the Buddhas, none
of the arahants who possess this marvel are in any way deficient in this
regard.
<!--l. 62815--><p class="indent" >   The marvel lies in their hearts &#8212; simply that they can&#8217;t take the marvel that
appears there and display it in the full measure of its wonder. Thus they devise
strategies for displaying it in their actions, which are simply attributes of the
Dhamma, not the actual Dhamma itself. For instance, the doctrine they teach in the
texts is simply an attribute of the Dhamma. Their act of teaching is also just an
attribute of the Dhamma. The actual Dhamma is when a meditator or a person who
listens to their teachings about the Dhamma follows the Dhamma in practice
and touches it stage by stage within his or her own heart. This is called
beginning to make contact with the actual Dhamma, step by step. However much
contact is made, it gives a sense of gratification felt exclusively within the
heart of the person who has gained that contact through his or her own
practice.
<!--l. 62829--><p class="indent" >   When it comes to ingenuity in teaching, no one excels the Buddhas. Even so,
they reveal only what they see as appropriate for humanity. They can&#8217;t
reveal the actual Dhamma &#8212; for example, by taking out the true marvel
in their hearts and unfolding it for the world to see, saying, &#8217;This is the
marvel of the Tathagata, of each Buddha. Do you see it?&#8217; This can&#8217;t be done,
for here we&#8217;re talking about the marvel of the purity of a heart that was
previously swamped with defilement like a heap of assorted excrement, but now
has become a pure, unsullied nature, or a pure, amazing nature because of
the practice of constantly and relentlessly cleansing it. They can&#8217;t show
that Dhamma to the world, saying, &#8217;Do you see this? Look at it. Look at
it. Feast your eyes till they&#8217;re full and then strive to make this treasure
your own!&#8217; So instead, they teach by using various strategies for those who
practice, describing the path in full detail, in terms both of causes and of
results.
<!--l. 62845--><p class="indent" >   What they bring out to show is simply the current of their voices, the breath of
their mouths. That&#8217;s what they bring out to speak, simply the breath of their
mouths. They can&#8217;t bring out the real thing. For example, when they say, &#8217;It&#8217;s
marvelous like this,&#8217; it&#8217;s just sound. The marvelous nature itself can&#8217;t be brought out.
All they can bring out is the action of saying, &#8217;That nature is marvelous,&#8217; so that we
can speculate for ourselves as to what that marvel is like. Even though this

doesn&#8217;t remove our doubts, it&#8217;s better than if we had never heard about it at
all.
<!--l. 62855--><p class="indent" >   But the basic principle in making us come to know and see the marvel of the
Dhamma is that first we have to speculate and then we follow with practice. This
qualifies as following the principles of the Dhamma the Buddha taught, and
this is fitting and proper. No matter what the difficulties and hardships
encountered in following the path, we shouldn&#8217;t let them form barriers to our
progress, because this is where the path lies. There are no other byways
that can take us easily to the goal. If our practice is difficult, we have to
stick with it. If it&#8217;s painful, we have to bear it, because it&#8217;s a duty we have
to perform, a burden we have to carry while working so as to attain our
aims.
<!--l. 62867--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma of a pure mind is like this: The mind is the Dhamma, the Dhamma
is the mind. We call it a mind only as long as it is still with the body and khandhas.
Only then can we call it a pure mind, the mind of a Buddha, or the mind of an
arahant. After it passes from the body and khandhas, there is no conventional
reality to which it can be compared, and so we can&#8217;t call it anything at
all.
<!--l. 62874--><p class="indent" >   No matter how marvelous that nature, no matter how much it may be ours,
there is no possible way we can use conventional realities to describe it or to
make comparisons, because that Dhamma, that realm of release, has no
conventions against which to measure things or make comparisons. It&#8217;s the same
as if we were in outer space: Which way is north, which way is south, we
don&#8217;t know. If we&#8217;re on Earth, we can say &#8217;east,&#8217; &#8217;west,&#8217; &#8217;north,&#8217; and &#8217;south&#8217;
because there are things that we can observe and compare so as to tell which
direction lies which way. We take the Earth as our standard. &#8217;High&#8217; and
&#8217;low&#8217; depend on the Earth as their frame of reference. How much higher
than this, lower than this, north of this, south of this: These things we can
say.
<!--l. 62887--><p class="indent" >   But if we&#8217;re out in outer space, there is no standard by which we can measure
things, and so we can&#8217;t say. Or as when we go up in an airplane: We can&#8217;t tell how
fast or how slow we&#8217;re going. When we pass a cloud, we can tell that we&#8217;re going
fast, but if we depend simply on our eyesight, we&#8217;re sure to think that the
speed of the airplane is nowhere near the speed of a car. We can clearly
see how deceptive our eyesight is in just this way. When we ride in a car,
the trees on both sides of the road look as if they were falling in together
down on the road behind us. Actually, they stay their separate selves. It&#8217;s
simply that the car runs past them. Since there are things that we sense,
that lie close enough for comparison, it seems as if the car were going really
fast.
<!--l. 62900--><p class="indent" >   As for the airplane, there&#8217;s nothing to make comparisons with, so it looks as if the
plane were dawdling along, as if it were going slower than a car, even though it&#8217;s
actually many times faster.
<!--l. 62904--><p class="indent" >   This is how it is when we compare the mind of an ordinary run-of-the-mill person
with the mind of the Buddha. Whatever the Buddha says is good and excellent, we
ordinary people tend to say that it&#8217;s not. Whatever we like, no matter how vile, we

say that it&#8217;s good. We don&#8217;t admit the truth, in the same way as thinking that a car
goes faster than an airplane.
<!--l. 62911--><p class="indent" >   The practice of attending to the mind is something very important. Try to
develop mindfulness (sati) and discernment so that they can keep up with the things
that come and entangle the mind. By and large, the heart itself is the instigator,
creating trouble continually, relentlessly. We then fall for the preoccupations the
heart turns out &#8212; and this makes us agitated, upset, and saddened, all because of
the thoughts formed by the heart.
<!--l. 62919--><p class="indent" >   These come from the heart itself, and the heart itself is what falls for them, saying
that this is this, and that is that, even though the things it names &#8217;this&#8217;
and &#8217;that&#8217; merely exist in line with their nature. They have no meaning
in and of themselves, that they are like &#8221;this&#8217; or &#8217;that.&#8217; The mind simply
gives them meanings, and then falls for its own meanings, making itself glad
or sad over those things without end. Thus the stress and suffering that
result from thought-formations have no end, no point of resolution, just as if
we were floating adrift in the middle of the sea waiting to breathe our last
breath.
<!--l. 62929--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhas all reached Awakening here in this human world because the human
world is rich in the Noble Truths. It&#8217;s where they are plain to see. The Noble Truth of
stress (dukkha) lies in the human body. Human beings know about stress &#8212; because
they&#8217;re smarter than common animals. The Noble Truth of the origin of
stress: This lies in the human heart. The Noble Truth of the path &#8212; the
path of practice to cure defilement (kilesa), craving (tanha), and mental
effluents (asava), which are the things that produce stress: This, human beings
also know. What is the path? To put it briefly: virtue, concentration, and
discernment. These things human beings know and can put into practice. The Noble
Truth of the cessation of stress: This, human beings also know. No matter
which of these truths, all human beings know them &#8212; although they may
not know how to behave toward them or take interest in behaving in line
with them, in which case there is no way the Dhamma can help them at
all.
<!--l. 62945--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhas thus taught the Dhamma in the human world, because the human
world lies in the center of all the levels of existence. We have been born in the center
of existence, in the midst of the religion. We should conform correctly to the central
point of the religion, so as to comprehend the religion&#8217;s teachings that lie in the
center of our heart.
<!--l. 62952--><p class="indent" >   The superlative Dhamma lies right here. It doesn&#8217;t lie anywhere else. The mind is
what can reach the Dhamma. The mind is what knows all dhammas. The affairs of
the Dhamma, then, do not lie beyond the mind, which is a fitting vessel for them.
Good, evil, pleasure, pain: The mind knows these things before anything else knows
them, so we should develop mindfulness and discernment to be resourceful, to keep
up with the events that are always becoming involved with the mind in the course of
each day.
<!--l. 62961--><p class="indent" >   If we&#8217;re intent on investigating the origin of stress, which fans out from our
various thought-formations, we will find that it arises without stop. It arises right
here in the mind. It&#8217;s fashioned right here. Even though we try to make it quiet, it

won&#8217;t be still. Why? Because of the &#8217;unquietness&#8217;, the thoughts with which the mind
disturbs itself, which it forms and sends out towards its preoccupations (arammana)
all the time. Once the mind sends out its thoughts, it then gathers in stress for itself.
It keeps at it, in and out like this. What goes out is the origin of stress, and
what comes back in is stress. In other words, thoughts form and go out as
the origin of stress, and when the results come back to the heart, they&#8217;re
stressful. These things are constantly being manufactured like this all the
time.
<!--l. 62974--><p class="indent" >   When we want the mind to have even just a little bit of calm, we really have to
force it; and even then these things still manage to drive the mind into forming
thoughts whenever we let down our guard. This is how it is with the origin of stress,
which is constantly producing suffering. It lies in the heart and is always arising.
For this reason, we must use mindfulness and discernment to diagnose and
remedy the origin of stress, to keep an eye out for it, and to snuff it out
right there, without being negligent. Wherever we sit or stand &#8212; whatever
our activity &#8212; we keep watch over this point, with mindfulness alert to it,
and discernment unraveling it so as to know it constantly for what it truly
is.
<!--l. 62986--><p class="indent" >   All those who practice to remove defilement practice in this way. In particular,
those who are ordained practice by going into the forest to look for a place conducive
to their striving in order to wipe out this very enemy. Even when they stay in
inhabited areas, or wherever they go, wherever they stay, they keep their attention
focused continually, step by step, on the persistent effort to remove and demolish the
origin of stress, which is a splinter, a thorn in the heart. Such people are bound to
develop more and more ease and well-being, step by step, in proportion to the
persistence of their striving.
<!--l. 62996--><p class="indent" >   We can see clearly when the mind is still and settles down: Thought-formations
are still, or don&#8217;t exist. Turmoil and disturbances don&#8217;t occur. The stress that
would otherwise result doesn&#8217;t appear. When the mind is quiet, stress is also
quiet. When thought-formations are quiet, the origin of stress is also quiet.
Stress is also quiet. All that remains at that moment is a feeling of peace and
ease.
<!--l. 63003--><p class="indent" >   The war between the mind and the defilements causing stress is like this. We have
to keep fighting with persistence. We have to use mindfulness and discernment,
conviction and persistence to contend with the war that disturbs and ravages the
mind, making it stagger and reel within. The disturbances will then gradually be
suppressed. Even when there is only a moment of quiet, we will come to see the harm
of the thought-formations that are constantly disturbing us. At the same time, we
will see the benefits of mental stillness &#8212; that it&#8217;s a genuine pleasure. Whether there
is a lot of stillness or a little, pleasure arises in proportion to the foundation of
stillness or the strength of the stillness, which in the texts is called samadhi, or
concentration.
<!--l. 63015--><p class="indent" >   A mind centered and still is called a mind in concentration, or a mind gathered in
concentration. This is what genuine concentration is like inside the heart. The names
of the various stages of concentration are everywhere, but actual concentration is
inside the heart. The heart is what gives rise to concentration. It produces

it, makes it on its own. When concentration is still, the mind experiences
cool respite and pleasure. It has its own foundation set firmly and solidly
within.
<!--l. 63024--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s as if we were under an eave or under the cooling shade of a tree. We&#8217;re
comfortable when it rains, we&#8217;re comfortable when the sun is out, because we don&#8217;t
have to be exposed to the sun and rain. The same holds true with a mind that has an
inner foundation of stillness: It&#8217;s not affected by this preoccupation or that, which
would otherwise disturb and entangle it repeatedly, without respite. This is because
stillness is the heart&#8217;s dwelling &#8212; &#8217;concentration,&#8217; which is one level of home for the
heart.
<!--l. 63033--><p class="indent" >   Discernment (pañña) is ingenuity, sound judgment, evaluating causes and effects
within and without; above, below, and in between &#8212; inside the body &#8212; all the way
to the currents of the mind that send out thoughts from various angles. Mindfulness
and discernment keep track of these things, investigating and evaluating them so as
to know causes and effects in terms of the heart&#8217;s thought-formations, or in terms of
the nature of sankhara within us, until we see the truth of each of these
things.
<!--l. 63042--><p class="indent" >   Don&#8217;t go investigating these things off target, by being clever with labels and
interpretations that go against the truth &#8212; because in the investigation of
phenomena, we investigate in line with the truth. We don&#8217;t resist the truth, for that
wouldsimply enhance the defilements causing stress at the very moment we think
we&#8217;re investigating phenomena so as to remove them.
<!--l. 63049--><p class="indent" >   Birth we have already experienced. As for old age, we&#8217;ve been growing old from
the day of our birth, older and older, step by step. Whatever our age, that&#8217;s how
long we&#8217;ve been growing old, until we reach the end of life. When we&#8217;re
old to the nth degree, we fall apart. In other words, we&#8217;ve been growing
old from the moment of birth &#8212; older by the day, the month, the year &#8212;
older and older continually. We call it &#8217;growing up&#8217;, but actually it&#8217;s growing
old.
<!--l. 63057--><p class="indent" >   See? Investigate it for what it really is. This is the great highway &#8212; the way of
nature. Don&#8217;t resist it. For example, the body is growing old, but we don&#8217;t
want it to be old. We want it always to be young. This is called resisting
the truth &#8212; which is stress. Even when we try to resist it, we don&#8217;t get
anywhere. What do we hope to gain by resisting it and creating stress for
ourselves? Actually, we gain nothing but the stress that comes from resisting the
truth.
<!--l. 63066--><p class="indent" >   Use discernment to investigate just like this. Whenever pain arises in any part
of the body, if we have medicine to treat it, then we treat it. When the
medicine can take care of it, the body recovers. When the medicine can&#8217;t, it
dies. It goes on its own. There&#8217;s no need for us to force it not to die, or to
stay alive for so-and-so many years, for that would be an absurdity. Even if
we forced it, it wouldn&#8217;t stay. We wouldn&#8217;t get any results and would just
be wearing ourselves out in vain. The body has to follow its own natural
principles.
<!--l. 63075--><p class="indent" >   When we investigate in line with its truth this way, we can be at our ease.
Wherever there&#8217;s pain, keep aware of it continually in line with its truth. Whether it

hurts a lot or a little, keep aware of its manifestations until it reaches the
ultimate point of pain &#8212; the death of the body &#8212; and that&#8217;s as far as it
goes.
<!--l. 63081--><p class="indent" >   Know it in line with its truth. Don&#8217;t resist it. Don&#8217;t set up any desires, because
the setting up of desire is a deficiency, a hunger. And hunger, no matter when or
what the sort, is pain: Hunger for sleep is pain, hunger for food is pain, hunger for
water is pain. When was it ever a good thing?
<!--l. 63087--><p class="indent" >   The hunger, the desires that arise, wanting things to be like this, wanting
them to be like that: These are all nothing but disturbances, issues that give
rise to stress and pain. This is why the Buddha doesn&#8217;t have us resist the
truth.
<!--l. 63092--><p class="indent" >   Use your discernment to investigate, to contemplate in line with the natural
principles of things as they already are. This is called discernment that doesn&#8217;t fly in
the face of truth &#8212; and the heart can then be at ease.
<!--l. 63097--><p class="indent" >   We study the four &#8217;Noble Truths&#8217; here in our body. In other words, we study
birth, aging, illness, and death, all of which lie in this single heap of elements (dhatu)
without ever leaving it. Birth is an affair of these elements. Growing up or
growing old, it&#8217;s old right here. When there&#8217;s illness, it manages to be ill right
here, in one part or another. When death comes, it dies right here. So we
have to study right here &#8212; where else would we study? We have to study
and know the things that involve us directly before we study anything else.
We have to study them comprehensively and to completion &#8212; studying
our own birth, our aging, our illness and pain, and completing our study of
our own death. That&#8217;s when we&#8217;ll be wise &#8212; wise to all the events around
us.
<!--l. 63110--><p class="indent" >   People who know the Dhamma through practicing so that they are wise to the
events that occur to themselves, do not flinch in the face of any of the conventional
realities of the world at all. This is how it is when we study the Dhamma, when we
know and see the Dhamma in the area of the heart &#8212; in other words, when we know
rightly and well. &#8217;Mindfulness and discernment that are wise all around themselves&#8217;
are wise in this way, not wise simply from being able to remember. They have to be
wise in curing doubt, in curing the recalcitrance of the heart, as well as in
curing their own attachments and false assumptions so as to leave only a
nature that is pure and simple. That&#8217;s when we&#8217;ll be really at ease, really
relieved.
<!--l. 63122--><p class="indent" >   Let the khandhas be khandhas pure and simple in their own way, without our
messing with them, without our struggling with them for power, without our forcing
or coercing them to be like this or like that. The khandhas are then khandhas, the
mind is then the mind, each with its own separate reality, each not infringing on the
others as it used to. Each performs its own duties. This is called khandhas pure and
simple, the mind pure and simple, without any conventional realities adulterating
them. What knows is what knows, the elements are elements, the khandhas are
khandhas.
<!--l. 63132--><p class="indent" >   Whatever things may break apart, let them break apart. We have already known
them clearly with our discernment. We have no doubts. We&#8217;ve known them in
advance, even before they die, so when death comes, what doubts can we have? &#8212;

especially now that they display the truth of their nature for us to see clearly. This is
called studying the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma. To study and practice this
way is to follow the same way that sages have practiced and known before
us.
<!--l. 63141--><p class="indent" >   All of these conditions are matters of conventional reality &#8212; matters of the
elements, the khandhas, or the sense media (ayatana). The four khandhas, the five
khandhas, whatever, are individual conditions, individual conditions that are
separated in line with conventions. Discernment is also a condition; and mindfulness,
another condition &#8212; conditions of the heart &#8212; but they&#8217;re Dhamma, means of curing
the mind that is clouded and obscured, means of washing away the things that cloud
and obscure it, until radiance appears through the power of the discernment that
cleanses the heart. Once the heart is radiant, in the next step it becomes
pure.
<!--l. 63152--><p class="indent" >   Why is it pure? Because all impurities have fallen away from it. The various
misconstruings that are an affair of defilement are all gone from the heart, so the
heart is pure. This pure heart means that we have completed our study of ourselves,
in line with the statement of the teaching:
<!--l. 63158--><p class="indent" >   vusitam brahmacariyam katam karaniyam: &#8217;The task of the religion is done, the
holy life is complete, there is no further task to be done.&#8217;
<!--l. 63161--><p class="indent" >   When the tasks we have had to do &#8212; abandoning and striving &#8212; are
done to completion, we know right here, because delusion lay right here in
the heart. We study and practice simply to cure our own delusion. Once
we know right here, and delusion is gone, what else is there to know? &#8212;
for beyond this there is nothing further to know. What else is there for us
to be deluded about? We&#8217;re no longer deluded, because we know fully all
around.
<!--l. 63169--><p class="indent" >   This very state of mind: When at the beginning I referred to the superlative
Dhamma, the marvelous Dhamma, I was referring to this very state of mind, this
very Dhamma &#8212; but it&#8217;s something known exclusively within itself, and exists only
within itself. It&#8217;s marvelous &#8212; this we know within our own mind. It&#8217;s superlative &#8212;
this we also know within our own mind. We can&#8217;t take it out or unfurl it like other
things for other people to see.
<!--l. 63177--><p class="indent" >   So if you want to have any Noble Treasures to show for yourself, practice. Remove
all those dirty stains from the heart, and the superlative things I have mentioned
will appear by their own nature &#8212; in other words, they will appear in the
mind.
<!--l. 63182--><p class="indent" >   This is called completing your study of the Dhamma; and your study of the world
is completed right here. The &#8217;world&#8217; means the world of elements, the world of the
khandhas that lie right here with each of us, which are more important than the
worlds of elements and khandhas belonging to other people, because this world of
elements and khandhas lies with us and has been weighing on the heart all
along.
<!--l. 63189--><p class="indent" >   When we have studied the Dhamma to the attainment of release, that&#8217;s all
there is to study. We&#8217;ve studied the world to completion and studied the
Dhamma in full. Our doubts are gone, and there is nothing that will ever
make us doubt again. As the Buddha exclaimed, &#8217;When dhammas become

apparent to the Brahman, earnest and absorbed, doubt comes to an end
because the conditions, the factors for continued being and birth, come to an
end.&#8217;
<!--l. 63197--><p class="indent" >   Once we have reached this level, we can live wherever we like. The war is ended
&#8212; the war between the mind and defilement, or the war between Dhamma and
defilement, is over. This is where we dismantle being and birth. This is where we
dismantle the heap of suffering in the round of rebirth &#8212; right here in the heart.
Since the heart is the wanderer through the cycle of rebirth, we have to dismantle
things right here, to know them right here. Once we know, that&#8217;s the end of all
problems right here.
<!--l. 63206--><p class="indent" >   In this whole wide world there are no problems. The only problem was the
issue of the heart that was deluded about itself and about the things that
became involved with it. Now that it has completely rectified the way it
is involved with things, there is nothing left &#8212; and that&#8217;s the end of the
problem.
<!--l. 63212--><p class="indent" >   From this point on, there are no more problems to trouble the heart until the day
of its total nibbana. This is how the Dhamma is studied to completion. The world
&#8212; the world of elements and khandhas &#8212; is studied to completion right
here.
<!--l. 63217--><p class="indent" >   So keep striving in order to see the marvel described at the beginning,
which was described in line with the truth with no aspect to invite any
doubt.
<!--l. 63221--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha and the Noble Disciples have Dhamma filling their hearts to the
brim. You are a disciple of the Tathagata, with a mind that can be made to
show its marvelousness through the practice of making it pure, just like
the Buddha and the Noble Disciples. So try to make it still and radiant,
because the heart has long lain buried in the mud. As soon as you can see
the harm of the mud and grow tired of it, you should urgently wake up,
take notice, and exert yourself till you can manage to make your way free.
Nibbana is holding its hand out, waiting for you. Aren&#8217;t you going to come
out?
<!--l. 63231--><p class="indent" >   Rebelliousness is simply distraction. The end of rebelliousness is stillness. When
the heart is still, it&#8217;s at ease. If it&#8217;s not still, it&#8217;s as hot as fire. Wherever you are,
everything is hot and troubled. Once it is still, then it&#8217;s cool and peaceful wherever
you are &#8212; cool right here in the heart. So make the heart cool with the practice,
because the heat and trouble lie with the heart. The heat of fire is one thing, but the
heat of a troubled heart is hotter than fire. Try to put out the fires of defilement,
craving, and mental effluents burning here in the heart, so that only the phenomenon
of genuine Dhamma remains. Then you will be cool and at peace, everywhere and
always.
<!--l. 63243--><p class="indent" >   And so I&#8217;ll ask to stop here.
<!--l. 63245--><p class="indent" >   The Prison World vs. the World Outside
<!--l. 63247--><p class="indent" >   Our mind, if we were to make a comparison with the world, is a perpetual
prisoner, like a person born in jail who lives in jail, behind bars, with no chance to
get out to see the outside world &#8212; someone who has grown from childhood to
adulthood entirely in a prison cell and so doesn&#8217;t know what there is outside;

someone who has seen pleasure and pain only in the prison and has never been out to
see what kind of pleasure, comfort, and freedom they have in the outside world. We
have no way of knowing what kind of happiness and enjoyment they have there in the
outside world, how they come and go, how they live, because we are kept in prison
from the day we are born until the day we die. This is a comparison, an
analogy.
<!--l. 63259--><p class="indent" >   We have only the pleasure and pain that the prison has to offer, with
nothing special, nothing obtained from the outside world so that when it
enters the prison we could see that, &#8217;This is something different from the
prison world &#8212; this is from the outside world, outside the prison;&#8217; so that
we could make comparisons and know that, &#8217;This is like this, that is like
that; this is better than that, that is better than this.&#8217; There is nothing
but the affairs of the prison. However much the pleasure and pain, however
great the deprivations, the difficulties, the oppression and coercion, that&#8217;s
simply the way it&#8217;s been all along from the very beginning &#8212; and so we
don&#8217;t know where to look for a way out or how to free ourselves. We don&#8217;t
even know where the outside world is, because we have seen only the inside
world: the prison where we have always been locked away, oppressed, starved,
beaten, tortured, deprived. Even our bedding, food, belongings &#8212; everything
of every sort &#8212; is like that of a prisoner in jail. And yet people like this
can still live this way because they have never seen enough of the outside
world to be able to make comparisons as to which is better, which is more
pleasant, in order to feel inclined to search for a way out to the outside
world.
<!--l. 63280--><p class="indent" >   A mind controlled by the power of defilement and mental effluents is like this. It
has been imprisoned by various kinds of defilement for aeons and aeons. For example,
in our present lifetime, the defilements that hold sway over the hearts of living beings
have been with us since the day of our birth. They have kept us in continual custody,
never giving us any freedom within ourselves at all. For this reason, we have
difficulty imagining what sort of pleasure there could be above and beyond the
way things are, just like a person who was born and has always lived in a
prison.
<!--l. 63290--><p class="indent" >   What sort of world is the world outside? Is it a good place to visit? A good place
to live? The Dhamma proclaims it loud and clear, but hardly anyone is interested.
Still, there are fortunately some places where some people are interested. In places
where no one proclaims it, where no one speaks of what the outside world &#8212; a mind
with Dhamma in charge &#8212; is like, no one knows what the teachings of the religion
are like. No one knows what the happiness that comes from the Dhamma is
like. Such people are so surrounded by darkness, so completely drowned in
attachment, that not even a single limb shows above the surface, because there is
no religion to pull them out. It&#8217;s as if the outside world didn&#8217;t exist. They
have nothing but the prison, the defilements, holding the heart in custody.
Born in this world, they have only the prison as their place to live and to
die.
<!--l. 63305--><p class="indent" >   A mind that has never known what could give it greater pleasure, comfort, and
freedom than it has at present, if we were to make a different comparison, is like a

duck playing in a mud puddle under a shanty. It keeps playing there: splat, splat,
splat, splat, splat. No matter how dirty or filthy it is, it&#8217;s content to play
because it has never seen the water of the ocean, of a river, of a lake or a pond
large enough for it to swim and immerse its entire body with ease. It has
known only the mud puddle that lies stagnant under the shanty, into which
things in the shanty get washed down. And so it plays there, thinking it&#8217;s
fun, swimming happily in its way &#8212; why? Because it has never seen water
wider or deeper than that, enough to give it more enjoyment in coming and
going or swimming around than it can find in the mud puddle under the
shanty.
<!--l. 63319--><p class="indent" >   As for ducks that live along broad, deep canals, they&#8217;re very different from the
duck under the shanty. They really enjoy themselves along rivers, lakes, canals, and
ponds. Wherever their owner herds them, there they go &#8212; crossing back and forth
over highways and byways, spreading in flocks of hundreds and thousands. Even
ducks like these have their happiness.
<!--l. 63326--><p class="indent" >   What do they stand for?
<!--l. 63328--><p class="indent" >   They stand for the mind. A mind that has never seen the pleasure, the comfort,
the enjoyment that comes from the Dhamma is like the duck playing in the mud
puddle under the shanty, or those that enjoy swimming in canals, rivers, or
lakes.
<!--l. 63333--><p class="indent" >   We at present have our pleasure and happiness through the controlling power of
the defilements, which is like the happiness of prisoners in jail. When the mind
receives training from the outside world &#8212; meaning the Dhamma that comes from
the transcendent (lokuttara) Dhammas, from the &#8217;land&#8217; of nibbana on down, level
by level to the human world, revealing every level, every realm &#8212; we find
that those of us who are inclined, who are interested in the outside world,
in happiness greater than that which exists at present, still exist. When
we hear the Dhamma step by step, or read books about the outside world
&#8212; about Dhamma, about releasing ourselves from the pain and suffering
we are forced to undergo within our hearts &#8212; our minds feel pleasure and
enjoyment. Interest. A desire to listen. A desire to practice so as to reap
the results step by step. This is where we begin to see the influence of the
outside world making itself felt. The heart begins to exert itself, trying to free
itself from the tyranny and oppression from within, like that of a prisoner in
jail.
<!--l. 63351--><p class="indent" >   Even more so, when we practice in the area of the mind: The more peace
we obtain, then the greater the effort, the greater the exertion we make.
Mindfulness and discernment gradually appear. We see the harm of the tyranny
and the oppression imposed by the defilements in the heart. We see the
value of the Dhamma, which is a means of liberation. The more it frees us,
the more ease we feel in the heart. Respite. Relief. This then is a means of
increasing our conviction in ascending stages, and of increasing our effort and
stamina in its wake. The mindfulness and discernment that used to lie buried
in the mud gradually revive and awaken, and begin to contemplate and
investigate.
<!--l. 63362--><p class="indent" >   In the past, no matter what assaulted us by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue,

body, or mind, we were like dead people. We held these things to be ordinary and
normal. They never provoked our mindfulness and discernment to investigate and
explore, searching for beginnings and ends, causes and effects. Even though these
things had been our enemies for a long, long time, making their assaults both day
and night, we were never interested.
<!--l. 63370--><p class="indent" >   Now, however, we develop an interest. When the heart begins to enter the current
of the Dhamma in which it has been trained to the point of developing a basis for
mindfulness and discernment, step by step, it is bound to see clearly both what is
beneficial and what is harmful, because these things dwell together &#8212; benefits and
harm &#8212; within this heart. The mind develops agility in contemplating and
investigating. The heart develops boldness in its explorations. Seeing harm, it tries to
remedy it. Seeing benefits, it tries to open the way for them; it tries to foster them in
ascending stages.
<!--l. 63380--><p class="indent" >   This is called the mind gradually gaining release from tyranny and oppression &#8212;
the prison &#8212; within. At the same time, it is gaining a view of the outside world,
seeing what sort of world it is, seeing whether it&#8217;s like the prison that exists at
present. Our eyes can see the outside world to some extent, can see how those in
the outside world live, how they come and go &#8212; and what about us in the
prison? What is it like to live overcome by defilements? How does the mind
feel as we gain gradual relief from the defilements? We can begin to make
comparisons.
<!--l. 63390--><p class="indent" >   Now at last we have an outside world and an inside world to compare! The
happiness and ease that come from removing however many of the defilements we can
remove, appear. The stress that continues as long as the remaining defilements still
exert their influence, we know clearly. We see their harm with our discernment on its
various levels and we try continually to remedy the situation without letting our
persistence lapse.
<!--l. 63398--><p class="indent" >   This is when mindfulness, discernment, conviction, and persistence stir themselves
out to the front lines: when we see both the outside world &#8212; however much we have
been able to liberate the heart from defilement &#8212; and the inside world, where the
defilements keep up their oppression and coercion. Before, we never knew
what to use for comparisons, because we had never seen anything other
than this. Because we were born buried in pain and suffering this way, no
pleasure from the outside world &#8212; from the Dhamma &#8212; ever appeared to
us.
<!--l. 63408--><p class="indent" >   What did appear was the kind of happiness that had suffering behind the scenes,
waiting to stomp in and obliterate that happiness without giving a moment&#8217;s
notice.
<!--l. 63412--><p class="indent" >   Now, however, we are beginning to know and see. We see the happiness of the
outside, that is, of the outside world, of those who have Dhamma reigning in their
hearts; and we see the happiness inside the prison, the happiness that lies under the
influence of defilement. We also see the suffering and stress that lie under the
influence of defilement. We know this all clearly with our own mindfulness and
discernment.
<!--l. 63419--><p class="indent" >   The happiness that comes from the outside world &#8212; in other words, from the
current of the Dhamma seeping deep into the heart &#8212; we begin to see, step by step,

enough to make comparisons. We see the outside world, the inside world, their
benefits and drawbacks. When we take them and compare them, we gain an
ever greater understanding &#8212; plus greater persistence, greater stamina &#8212;
to the point that when anything connected with defilement that used to
tyrannize and oppress the mind passes our way, we immediately feel called
upon to tackle it, remedy it, strip it away, and demolish it step by step
through the power of mindfulness and discernment backed by persistent
effort.
<!--l. 63431--><p class="indent" >   The mind will set itself spinning. When its awareness of harm is great, its
appreciation of what is beneficial is also great. When the desire to know and see
the Dhamma is great, when the desire to gain release is great, persistence
will have to become greater in their wake. Stamina and resilience will also
come in their wake, because they all exist in the same heart. When we see
harm, the entire heart is what sees it. When we see benefits, the entire heart
is what sees. When we try to make our way with various methods in line
with our abilities, it&#8217;s an affair of the entire heart making the effort to free
itself.
<!--l. 63441--><p class="indent" >   This is why these things, such as persistence, that are the mind&#8217;s tools, the mind&#8217;s
support, come together. For example, saddha, conviction in the paths (magga) and
their fruitions (phala), conviction in the realm beyond suffering and stress; viriya,
persistence, perseverance in gaining release for oneself step by step; khanti,
stamina, endurance in order to be unyielding in passing over and beyond: All of
these things come together. Mindfulness and discernment, contemplating
along the way, seeing what is right and what is wrong, will come in their
wake.
<!--l. 63451--><p class="indent" >   If we were to speak in terms of the principles of the formal Dhamma as
expressed by the Buddha, this is called the path converging (magga-samangi),
gradually gathering itself into this single heart. Everything comes together:
Right View, Right Resolve, Right Speech, Right Action, all the way to Right
Concentration, all come gathering into this single heart. They don&#8217;t go anywhere
else.
<!--l. 63458--><p class="indent" >   Right Action: Our only right undertakings are sitting and walking meditation,
because we have reached the stage of precision work where the heart gathers
together. The mind is in a state of the path converging &#8212; gathering itself into a
single heart.
<!--l. 63463--><p class="indent" >   Right View, Right Resolve: These refer to the concerns of discernment, always
exploring the affairs of the elements, the khandhas, whatever appears or makes
contact, arises and vanishes, whether good or evil, past or future, appearing in the
heart. Mindfulness and discernment slash these things to bits step by step without
bothering to waste time.
<!--l. 63470--><p class="indent" >   Right Action: On the level of the body, this refers to doing sitting and walking
meditation, making the effort to abandon the defilements no matter what
our posture. On the level of the heart, this refers to persistence within the
mind.
<!--l. 63475--><p class="indent" >   Right Speech: We speak only of the Dhamma. Our conversation deals only with
the topics of effacement (sallekha-dhamma), topics of polishing away or

washing away defilements and mental effluents from the heart, telling what
methods we can use that will utterly end the defilements: This is Right
Speech.
<!--l. 63481--><p class="indent" >   Right Livelihood: When the heart feeds on any object that&#8217;s its enemy, this is
called maintaining a wrong livelihood. Since the object is an enemy of the heart, the
heart will have to be clouded. There&#8217;s nothing good about it at all. It has to lead to
greater or lesser amounts of suffering and stress within the heart in proportion to the
heart&#8217;s crudeness or refinement. This is called poison. Wrong livelihood. We have to
correct it immediately. Immediately.
<!--l. 63489--><p class="indent" >   Any mental object that&#8217;s rightful, that leads to happiness, well-being, and
ease, is a fitting preoccupation, a fitting food for the heart, providing it
with peace and well-being. This is how Right Livelihood is maintained with
Dhamma on the ascending levels of training the heart. As for Right Livelihood
on the physical level, dealing with food or alms, that applies universally
for Buddhists in general to conduct themselves in line with their personal
duties.
<!--l. 63497--><p class="indent" >   Right Effort: What sort of effort? This we know. The Buddha taught four kinds of
effort: (1) Try to be careful not to let evil arise within yourself. (2) Try to
abandon evil that has already arisen. In being careful not to let evil arise, we
have to be careful by being mindful. Using mindfulness in trying not to let
evil arise means being alert to the mind that thinks and wanders about,
gathering suffering and stress into itself. This is because thought-formations
of the wrong sort are the origin of stress, and so we should be careful to
guard against them. Don&#8217;t be careless or complacent. (3) Try to develop
what is skillful &#8212; intelligence &#8212; so as to increase it step by step. (4) Try to
safeguard the skillful things that have arisen so as to develop them even further
and not let them deteriorate. All of these right exertions apply right within
us.
<!--l. 63511--><p class="indent" >   Right Mindfulness keeps watch over the heart. Mindfulness and self-awareness
keep constant track of its behavior and activities. Whatever makes contact by way of
the eye, ear, nose, tongue, or body, if it doesn&#8217;t go into the heart, where does it go?
The heart is an enormous place, always ready to be informed of various things, both
good and evil. Discernment is what contemplates and deliberates. Mindfulness is
what keeps vigilant, inspecting whatever comes in to engage the heart. Whatever the
preoccupation, good or evil, mindfulness and discernment contemplate and are
selective of what engages the heart. Whatever they see as improper, the
mind will reject immediately. Immediately. Discernment is what makes the
rejection.
<!--l. 63523--><p class="indent" >   Right Concentration: Our work for the sake of making the defilements quiet
through concentration is steady and constant, to the point where the results appear
as peace and calm in the heart, as a true place of rest without any distractions
coming in to disturb the heart at that moment.
<!--l. 63529--><p class="indent" >   When entering concentration so as to relax the mind, in order to give strength to
discernment in its continuing explorations, you should go ahead and really rest &#8212;
rest in concentration. Enter the calm. Completely stop all thoughts and explorations
in the area of discernment. Let the mind settle in and relax. It doesn&#8217;t have to think

or contrive anything at all related to its work. Let the mind rest comfortably by
giving it a single preoccupation. If the mind happens to be extremely engrossed in its
investigations so that you can&#8217;t rein it in, use &#8217;buddho&#8217; as a means to drag it
in. Make the mind stay with &#8217;buddho, buddho, buddho.&#8217; Even though the
meditation word &#8217;buddho&#8217; may be a mental contrivance, it&#8217;s a contrivance in a
single focal idea. Contriving a single focal idea can cause the mind to settle
down.
<!--l. 63543--><p class="indent" >   For example, if while we are repeating, &#8217;buddho, buddho, buddho,&#8217; the mind
flashes back to its work because it is engrossed in its unfinished business, we should
repeat the meditation word even faster so as not to let the mind go back to its work.
In other words, when the mind is at the stage where it is engrossed in its work,
we could say &#8212; to put it in worldly terms &#8212; that we can&#8217;t let down our
guard, although on this level it&#8217;s hard to say that the mind lets down its
guard. To get nearer the truth, we should say that we can&#8217;t loosen our grip.
To put it simply, we can&#8217;t loosen our grip. Otherwise the mind will jump
back out to work. So at this point we have to be firm with our meditation
word. Force the mind to stay with its single preoccupation &#8212; &#8217;buddho&#8217; &#8212;
as a means of reining the mind in. Repeat &#8217;buddho, buddho, buddho&#8217; in
really close frequency; then &#8217;buddho&#8217; and the mind will become one. The
heart will be firm and calm down, calm down, relaxing, relaxing, setting
aside all its work. The mind will become cool and peaceful. This is Right
Concentration.
<!--l. 63560--><p class="indent" >   When the time comes to rest, you have to rest like this for it to qualify as Right
Concentration. When you&#8217;ve had enough, when you see that the mind has regained
strength, then simply let go &#8212; that&#8217;s all &#8212; and the mind will spring immediately
back to work. It springs out of oneness, of having a single preoccupation, and returns
to being two with its work. At this point, the heart gets back to work without
worrying about concentration while it is working. In the same way, when centering
the mind for the sake of stillness, you don&#8217;t have to worry about your work at
all.
<!--l. 63570--><p class="indent" >   When resting, you have to rest, in the same way that when eating you don&#8217;t have
to do any work at all except for the work of eating. When sleeping, sleep
peacefully. You shouldn&#8217;t be concerned with any work at all. But once you
have begun work, you shouldn&#8217;t concern yourself with eating and sleeping.
Really set your mind on your work. This is called doing a solid piece of
work: work in its proper phases, work at the proper time, in keeping with
events, &#8217;Right Action,&#8217; work that doesn&#8217;t overstep its boundaries, appropriate
work.
<!--l. 63579--><p class="indent" >   The practice of centering the mind is something you can&#8217;t neglect. In practicing
for the sake of the heart&#8217;s happiness, the view that centering the mind, keeping still,
serves no purpose is wrong. If someone is addicted to concentration, unwilling to
come out and work, that&#8217;s improper and should be criticized so that he or she will
get down to work. But once the mind has become engrossed in its work,
concentration is a necessity in certain areas, at certain times. Ordinarily, if we work
without resting or sleeping, we ultimately can&#8217;t continue with our work. Even though
some of our money gets used up when we eat, let it be used up &#8212; because the result

is that our body gains strength from eating and can return to its work in line
with its duties. Even though money gets used up and the food we eat gets
used up, still it&#8217;s used up for a purpose: for energy in the body. Whatever
gets consumed, let it be consumed, because it doesn&#8217;t hurt our purposes.
If we don&#8217;t eat, where are we going to get any strength? Whatever gets
spent, let it be spent for the sake of strength, for the sake of giving rise to
strength.
<!--l. 63597--><p class="indent" >   The same holds true with resting in concentration: When we&#8217;re resting so as to
give rise to stillness, the stillness is the strength of mind that can reinforce
discernment and make it agile. We have to rest so as to have stillness. If there is no
stillness, if there&#8217;s nothing but discernment running, it&#8217;s like a knife that hasn&#8217;t been
sharpened. We keep chopping away &#8212; chock, chock, chock &#8212; but it&#8217;s hard to tell
whether we&#8217;re using the edge of the blade or the back. We simply have the desire to
know, to see, to understand, to uproot defilement, whereas discernment hasn&#8217;t been
sharpened by resting in stillness &#8212; the reinforcement that gives peace and
strength in the heart &#8212; and so it&#8217;s like a knife that hasn&#8217;t been sharpened.
Whatever gets chopped doesn&#8217;t cut through easily. It&#8217;s a simple waste of
energy.
<!--l. 63611--><p class="indent" >   So for the sake of what&#8217;s fitting while resting the mind in its &#8217;home of
concentration,&#8217; we have to let it rest. Resting is thus like using a whetstone to
sharpen discernment. Resting the body strengthens the body, and in the same way
resting the mind strengthens the mind.
<!--l. 63616--><p class="indent" >   When it comes out this time, now that it has strength, it&#8217;s like a knife that has
been sharpened. The object is the same old object, the discernment is the same old
discernment, the person investigating is the same old person, but once we focus our
examination, it cuts right through. This time it&#8217;s like a person who has rested, slept,
and eaten at his leisure, and whose knife is fully sharpened. He chops the same old
piece of wood, he&#8217;s the same old person, and it&#8217;s the same old knife, but it cuts right
through with no trouble at all &#8212; because the knife is sharp, and the person has
strength.
<!--l. 63626--><p class="indent" >   In the same way, the object is the same old object, the discernment is the same
old discernment, the person practicing is the same old person, but we&#8217;ve been
sharpened. The mind has strength as a reinforcement for discernment and so things
cut right through in no time at all &#8212; a big difference from when we hadn&#8217;t rested in
concentration!
<!--l. 63632--><p class="indent" >   Thus concentration and discernment are interrelated. They simply do their work
at different times. When the time comes to center the mind, center it. When the time
comes to investigate in the area of discernment, give it your all &#8212; your full alertness,
your full strength. Get to the full Dhamma: the full causes and the full effects. In the
same way, when resting, give it a full rest. Practice these things at separate times.
Don&#8217;t let them interfere with each other &#8212; being worried about concentration
when examining with discernment, or being preoccupied with the affairs
of discernment when entering concentration &#8212; for that would be wrong.
Whichever work you&#8217;re going to do, really make it a solid piece of work. This is
the right way, the appropriate way &#8212; the way Right Concentration really
is.

<!--l. 63646--><p class="indent" >   Once discernment has begun uprooting defilements step by step, the heart
develops brightness. The lightness of the mind is one of the benefits that come from
removing the things that are hazardous, the things that are filthy. We see the value of
this benefit and keep on investigating.
<!--l. 63652--><p class="indent" >   What defilement is, is a weight on the heart. Our mind is like a prisoner
constantly overpowered &#8212; coerced and tormented &#8212; by defilements and mental
effluents ever since we were born. When we come right down to it, where is
defilement? Where is being and birth? Right here in this same heart. When you
investigate, these things gather in, gather in, and enter this single heart. The cycle of
rebirth doesn&#8217;t refer to anything else: It refers to this single heart that spins in
circles. It&#8217;s the only thing that leads us to birth and death. Why? Because the seeds
of these things are in the heart.
<!--l. 63663--><p class="indent" >   When we use mindfulness and discernment to investigate, we explore so as to see
clearly, and we keep cutting in, step by step, until we reach the mind that is the
culprit, harboring unawareness (avijja), which is the important seed of the cycle in
the heart. We keep dissecting, keep investigating in, investigating in, so that there is
nothing left of &#8217;this is this&#8217; or &#8217;that is that.&#8217; We focus our investigation on the mind
in the same way as we have done with phenomena (sabhava-dhamma) in
general.
<!--l. 63672--><p class="indent" >   No matter how much brightness there may be in the heart, we should know that
it&#8217;s simply a place for the heart to rest temporarily as long as we are still unable to
investigate it to the point where we can disperse and destroy it. But don&#8217;t forget that
this shining star of a heart is actually unawareness.
<!--l. 63678--><p class="indent" >   So investigate, taking that as the focal point of your investigation.
<!--l. 63680--><p class="indent" >   So then. If this is going to be obliterated until there&#8217;s no more awareness, leaving
nothing at all &#8212; to the point where the &#8217;knower&#8217; is destroyed along with it &#8212; then
let&#8217;s find out once and for all. We&#8217;re investigating to find the truth, to know the
truth, so we have to get all the way down to causes and effects, to the truth of
everything of every sort. Whatever is going to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. Even
if ultimately the &#8217;knower&#8217; who is investigating will be destroyed as well, then let&#8217;s find
out with our mindfulness and discernment. We don&#8217;t have to leave anything
remaining as an island or a vantage point to deceive ourselves. Whatever is &#8217;us,&#8217;
whatever is &#8217;ours,&#8217; don&#8217;t leave it standing. Investigate down to the truth of all things
together.
<!--l. 63693--><p class="indent" >   What&#8217;s left, after the defilement of unawareness is absolutely destroyed, is
something beyond the range to which convention can reach or destroy. This is called
the pure mind, or purity. The nature of this purity cannot be destroyed by anything
at all.
<!--l. 63698--><p class="indent" >   Defilements are conventional realities that can arise and vanish. Thus they can be
cleansed, made to increase, made to decrease, made to disappear, because they are an
affair of conventions. But the mind pure and simple &#8212; the phenomenon called a
released mind &#8212; lies beyond the range to which any defilements, which are all
conventions, can reach and destroy. If the mind isn&#8217;t yet pure, it&#8217;s a conventional
reality just like other things, because conventional things have infiltrated it.
Once they are entirely removed, the phenomenon of release is one that no
defilement can any longer affect &#8212; because it lies beyond range. So what is

destroyed?
<!--l. 63709--><p class="indent" >   Stress stops, because the cause of stress stops. Nirodha &#8212; the cessation of stress
&#8212; also stops. The path, the tool that wipes out the cause of stress, also stops. The
four Noble Truths all stop together. Stress stops, the cause of stress stops, the path
stops, the cessation of stress stops.
<!--l. 63715--><p class="indent" >   But listen! What knows that &#8217;that stops&#8217; is not a Noble Truth. It lies above the
Noble Truths. The investigation of the Noble Truths is an investigation for the sake
of this. Once we reach the real thing, the four Noble Truths have no more role to
play, no need to be cleansed, remedied, or removed. For example, discernment: Now
that we&#8217;ve worked to the full extent, we can let go of discernment, with no need to
set rules for it. Both mindfulness and discernment are tools in the battle. Once
the war is over, the enemy is wiped out, so these qualities are no longer at
issue.
<!--l. 63725--><p class="indent" >   What&#8217;s left? Purity. The Buddha, in proclaiming the Dhamma to the world, took
it from this pure nature. The doctrines of the religion came from this nature, and in
the approach he used in teaching, he had to teach about stress because these
conditions are directly related to this mind. He taught us to know how to remedy,
how to stop, how to strive &#8212; everything of every sort &#8212; all the way to
the goal at the end of the path, after which nothing more need be said.
This is purity. The mind has come out to the outside world. It has left the
prison and come to the outside world &#8212; freedom &#8212; never to be imprisoned
again.
<!--l. 63736--><p class="indent" >   But no one wants to go to this world, because they have never seen it. This is an
important world &#8212; lokuttara, the transcendent, a realm higher than other worlds &#8212;
but we simply call it the outside world, outside of all conventions. We call it a &#8217;world&#8217;
just as a figure of speech, because our world has its conventions, and so we simply
talk about it that way.
<!--l. 63743--><p class="indent" >   Think about escaping from this prison. You&#8217;ve been born in prison, live in prison
and die in prison. You&#8217;ve never once died outside of prison. So, for once, get your
heart out of prison. You&#8217;ll be really comfortable &#8212; really comfortable! &#8212; like the
Buddha and his Noble Disciples: They were born in prison like you, but they died
outside of the prison. They died outside of the world. They didn&#8217;t die in this world
that&#8217;s so narrow and confining.
<!--l. 63751--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;ll ask to stop here.
<!--l. 63753--><p class="indent" >   Birth &amp; Death
<!--l. 63755--><p class="indent" >   People come with questions &#8212; some of which I can remember &#8212; and everyone
has the question that&#8217;s waiting right at the barn door: Is there a next world after
death? The next world, who goes on to the next world: These sorts of things aren&#8217;t
any one person&#8217;s issue. They&#8217;re an issue for all of us who are carrying a burden.
When people ask this sort of question, I ask them in return, &#8217;Was there a yesterday?
Was there a this morning? Is there a present at this moment?&#8217; They admit that
there was and is. &#8217;Then will there be a tomorrow? A day after tomorrow?
A this month? A next month? A this year? A next year and years after
that?&#8217;
<!--l. 63766--><p class="indent" >   Things in the past that we can remember, we can use to make guesses about the
future. Even for things that haven&#8217;t yet happened, we can make comparisons with

things that have already occurred. The future has to follow the way things have been
in the past. For example, yesterday has already occurred, today is occurring. These
things have followed one after the other. We know this, we remember, we haven&#8217;t
forgotten. This afternoon, this evening, tonight, tomorrow morning: We&#8217;ve already
seen that things have been like this. This is the way things have happened, without
being otherwise, and so we accept that this is the way they will continue to
be.
<!--l. 63777--><p class="indent" >   Doubts about this world and the next, or about things concerning ourselves: This
is delusion about ourselves. This is why these things become big issues, causing
endless fuss all over the world of rebirth. &#8217;Is there a next world? When people die, are
they reborn?&#8217; These questions go together, for who is it that takes birth and dies? We
ourselves &#8212; always dying and taking birth. What comes to this world and goes to
the next world is us. Who else would it be? If not for this being of the world, this
wanderer, there wouldn&#8217;t be anyone weighed down with these questions and
burdens.
<!--l. 63787--><p class="indent" >   This is the harm of delusion, of being unable to remember. It shows within us,
but we can&#8217;t catch hold of its causes, of why it has come about. Things
that have happened, we can&#8217;t remember. Our own affairs spin us around
in circles and get us so tangled up that we don&#8217;t know which way to go.
This is why self-delusion is an endless complication. Being deluded about
other things is not so bad, but being deluded about ourselves blocks all
the exits. We can&#8217;t find any way out. The results come right back at us &#8212;
they don&#8217;t go anywhere else &#8212; bringing us suffering, because these sorts of
doubts are questions with which we bind ourselves, not questions by which
we set ourselves free. We can have no hope of resolving and understanding
these doubts if we don&#8217;t find confirmation of the Dhamma in the area of
meditation.
<!--l. 63801--><p class="indent" >   This is why the Lord Buddha taught us to unravel and look at our own affairs.
But unraveling our own affairs is something very critical. If we do it by guessing or
speculating or whatever, we won&#8217;t succeed. The only way to succeed is to develop
goodness step by step as a means of support and of drawing us in to mental
development (bhavana), or meditation, so as to unravel and look at our own affairs,
which lie gathered in the range of meditation. This is what will lead us to know
clearly and to cut through our doubts, at the same time leading us to satisfactory
results. We will be able to stop wondering about death and rebirth or death and
annihilation.
<!--l. 63812--><p class="indent" >   What are our own affairs? The affairs of the heart. The heart is what acts,
creating causes and results for itself all the time: pleasure, pain, complications, and
turmoil. For the most part, it ties itself down more than helping itself. If we don&#8217;t
force it into good ways, the hearts reaps trouble as a result, the suffering that comes
from being agitated and anxious, thinking restlessly from various angles for no
worthwhile reason. The results we receive are an important factor in making us
pained and unsettled. This is thus a difficult matter, a heavy matter for all those who
are deluded about the world, deluded about themselves, agitated by the
world, and agitated about themselves without being interested in confirming
the truth about themselves using the principles of the Dhamma, principles

that guarantee the truth. For example, once we die, we must be reborn;
as long as the seeds of rebirth are in the heart, we have to continue being
reborn repeatedly. It can&#8217;t be otherwise &#8212; for instance, being annihilated at
death.
<!--l. 63829--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha teaches us to keep watch of the instigator. In other words, we should
observe our own heart, which is what causes birth and death. If we don&#8217;t
understand it, he tells us various angles from which to approach until we
understand and can deal with it properly. In particular, he teaches us to
meditate, using any of the meditation themes, repeating it so that the mind
&#8212; which has no footing to hold to, which is in such a turmoil of finding
no refuge that it dwells in unlimited dreams and infatuations &#8212; will gain
enough of a footing to get on its feet, will gain quiet and calm, free from
the distraction and unsteadiness that would destroy the peace of mind we
want.
<!--l. 63841--><p class="indent" >   For example, he teaches us to repeat &#8217;buddho, dhammo, sangho&#8217; or &#8217;atthi&#8217;
(bones), &#8217;kesa&#8217; (hair of the head), &#8217;loma&#8217; (hair of the body), or whatever phrase suits
our temperament, being mindful to keep watch over our meditation theme so as not
to become forgetful and send the mind elsewhere, away from it. This is so
that the mind, which we used to send in various places, can latch onto or
dwell with its Dhamma-theme: its meditation word. Our awareness, which
used to be scattered among various preoccupations, will now gather into
that point &#8212; the mind &#8212; which is the gathering place of awareness. All
the currents of our awareness will converge at the Dhamma-theme we are
repeating or pursuing with interest. This is because the meditation word &#8212;
which is something for the mind to hold to, so that it can gain a footing
&#8212; becomes more and more an object of clear and conspicuous awareness.
Thus at the beginning stages of meditation, the meditation word is very
important.
<!--l. 63857--><p class="indent" >   Once we have seen the intrinsic value of the peace that appears this way, we at
the same time see clearly the harm that comes from the agitation and turmoil of the
mind that has no footing to hold to, and that creates havoc for itself. We needn&#8217;t ask
anyone: The benefits of a peaceful mind and the harm of an agitated mind, we
see within our own mind from having practiced meditation. This is a step,
the first step, by which the Buddha teaches us to know the affairs of the
mind.
<!--l. 63866--><p class="indent" >   We then try to make the mind progressively more firmly settled and calm
by repeating the meditation word, as already mentioned. We keep at it,
again and again, until we become adept, until the mind can become still the
way we want it to. The sense of well-being that arises from a calm heart
becomes even more prominent and clear all the time. As soon as the mind
becomes still, giving rise to clear and prominent awareness, it is at the same
time a gathering in of the defilements into a single spot so that we can see
them more clearly and more easily observe their behavior &#8212; so that we
can more easily cure them and remove them with the levels of discernment
suited to dealing with crude, intermediate, and subtle defilements step by
step.

<!--l. 63878--><p class="indent" >   Now, concerning defilements, the things that force the mind to be agitated in
countless, inconceivable ways: We can&#8217;t catch sight of what defilement is, what the
mind is, what the Dhamma is, until we first have a firm basis of mental stillness.
When the mind gathers in and is still, the defilements gather in and are still as well.
When the mind draws into itself, to be itself or to become a point on which we
can focus and understand, the affairs of defilement also enter a restricted
range in that same point. They gather in at the heart and rarely ever run
loose to stir up trouble for the heart as they used to before the mind was
still.
<!--l. 63889--><p class="indent" >   Once the mind is still so that it can stand on its feet, we are then taught to use
our discernment to investigate, unravel, and contemplate the various parts of the
body in which the defilements hide out. What is the mind interested in? When it
isn&#8217;t quiet, with what does it like to involve itself? While the mind is quiet, it doesn&#8217;t
stir up trouble for itself, but a common habit with us human beings is that once we
have gained peace and relaxation, we get lazy. We simply want to lie down and rest.
We don&#8217;t want to unravel the body, the elements, or the khandhas with our
mindfulness and discernment for the sake of seeing the truth and removing the
various defilements from the heart. We don&#8217;t like to reflect on the fact that
those who have abandoned and removed the various kinds of defilement that
hide out in the body and the khandhas have done so by using mindfulness
and discernment. As for mental stillness or concentration, that&#8217;s simply a
gathering together of the defilements into a restricted range. It&#8217;s not an
abandoning or a removal of defilement. Please remember this and take it to
heart.
<!--l. 63906--><p class="indent" >   The heart, when it isn&#8217;t still, tends to get entangled with sights, sounds, smells,
tastes, and tactile sensations, and to take them as issues for stirring itself up. We can
know with our mindfulness and discernment which of the various sights, sounds, etc.,
the mind tends to favor most strongly. While we are investigating, we can
know with our mindfulness and discernment the objects with which the
mind is involving itself. We can observe the affairs of the mind because the
mind has been still. As soon as it begins to head out toward its various
preoccupations, we know. This is why we are taught to investigate and unravel things
with our discernment so as to know what the mind goes to involve itself
with. Try to observe so as to know, so as to see clearly with mindfulness and
discernment while you are investigating. Only when you are stilling the mind in
concentration is there no need for you to investigate, because concentration
and discernment take turns working at different times, as I have already
explained.
<!--l. 63922--><p class="indent" >   When you are investigating visual objects, with which visual object is the mind
most involved? What is the reason? Look at the object. Dissect it. Analyze it into its
parts so as to see it clearly for what it truly is. Once you have dissected the object &#8212;
whatever it is &#8212; so as to see it with discernment in line with its truth, at the same
time you will see the absurdity, the deceptiveness of the mind that grows attached
and misconstrues things in all kinds of ways without any real reason, without any
basis in fact. Once you have investigated carefully, you&#8217;ll see that the object has none
of the worth construed and assigned to it by the mind. There are simply

the assumptions of the mind that has fallen for the object, that&#8217;s all. Once
you have investigated, separating the various parts of &#8217;their&#8217; body or &#8217;your&#8217;
body so as to see them in detail, you won&#8217;t see anything of any worth or
substance at all. The heart of its own accord will see the harmfulness of its
assumptions, its labels and attachments. The more it investigates, the more
clearly it sees &#8212; not only the various sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and
tactile sensations, but also the acts of the mind involved with those objects
&#8212; until it fully knows and clearly sees with discernment, because it has
been constantly unraveling things both within and without. You fully know
and clearly see the acts inside the heart that become involved, knowing
that they come about for this reason and that, all of which are thoroughly
absurd.
<!--l. 63946--><p class="indent" >   Before, you didn&#8217;t know why the mind was involved. But now you know clearly
that it is involved for this reason and that: namely, delusion and mistaken
assumptions. When you investigate in line with the truth and see the true
nature of external things, you know clearly within yourself that the mind
has construed phenomena to be like this and like that, which is why it has
continually developed more and more attachment and clinging, more and
more of the defilements of love and hatred. The heart then realizes its own
absurdity.
<!--l. 63955--><p class="indent" >   When the heart realizes that it has been deluded and absurd, it withdraws
inward, because if it were to continue to think of becoming attached to those things,
it would get cut right through by discernment &#8212; so what would it gain from
becoming attached? To investigate so as to know clearly that this is this, and that is
that, in line with the truth of every individual thing of every sort: This is the way to
unravel the great mass of problems that, taken together, are results &#8212; the
mass of suffering inside the heart. This is how we are taught to unravel
it.
<!--l. 63965--><p class="indent" >   As discernment constantly keeps unraveling things without letup until it
understands clearly and distinctly, we don&#8217;t have to tell it to let go. Once the mind
knows, it lets go of its own accord. It is bound to let go of its own accord. The mind
attached is the mind that doesn&#8217;t yet know, doesn&#8217;t yet understand with
discernment. Once the full heart knows, it fully lets go, with no concern or regrets.
All the concerns that used to bother and disturb the mind vanish of their own accord
because discernment sees right through them. Once it sees everything clearly and
distinctly, what is there left to grope for? The problems of the heart that used to be
broad and wide-ranging now become more and more restricted. Problems
concerning outside affairs become less and less, as I have said in previous
talks.
<!--l. 63978--><p class="indent" >   The next step is to unravel the mind, the gathering point of subtle defilements, so
as to see what it is looking for when it &#8217;blips&#8217; out. Where does it &#8217;blip&#8217; from? What is
there that pressures the mind into forming thoughts of various issues? When
mindfulness and discernment can keep up with the thoughts that come &#8217;blipping&#8217;
out, these thoughts vanish immediately without amounting to anything,
without forming issues to entangle us as they did before. This is because
mindfulness and discernment are wise to them, and always ready to herd

them in and wipe them out as they keep following in on the tracks of the
origin of defilement to see exactly where it is. Where do its children and
grandchildren &#8212; the defilements &#8212; come from? Animals have their parents, what
are the parents of these defilements? Where are they? Why do they keep
forming again and again, thinking again and again? Why do they give rise to
assumptions and interpretations, increasing suffering and stress without
stop?
<!--l. 63994--><p class="indent" >   Actually, thought-formations are formed at the mind. They don&#8217;t come from
anywhere else. So investigate, following them in, step by step, without losing the trail
that will lead you to the truth, to the culprit. This is genuine exploring, observing
the affairs of all the defilements, using the power of genuine mindfulness and
discernment. Ultimately we will know what the mind is lacking, what it is
still connected with, what it is interested in, what it wants to know and to
see.
<!--l. 64002--><p class="indent" >   So we follow the connections, follow the seeds on in. Day by day, the defilements
become more and more restricted, more and more restricted. This is because the
bridges that connect them to sights, sound, smells, tastes, tactile sensations,
and the various things of the world in general have been cut away from the
mind by using continual mindfulness and discernment to the point where we
have no more doubts. It&#8217;s as if the outside world didn&#8217;t exist. There remain
only the preoccupations that form &#8212; blip, blip, blip &#8212; in the mind. This is
where the rebellious monarch lies. The one who concocts and creates, the
one who struggles and writhes restlessly in big and little ways, lies right
here.
<!--l. 64014--><p class="indent" >   Before, we didn&#8217;t know in what ways the mind was writhing. All we knew were
the results that appeared, unsatisfactory every time, giving us nothing but
suffering and stress, which no one in the world wants. Our own heart was so
burdened with stress that it couldn&#8217;t find a way out, because it had no inkling
of how to remedy things. But now that we know, these things gradually
disappear so that we know and see more and more clearly at the mind, which is
where unawareness is performing as an actor, as an issue-maker, here inside
us. It can&#8217;t find anything to latch onto outside, so it simply acts inside.
Why doesn&#8217;t it latch on? Because mindfulness and discernment understand,
and have it surrounded. So how could it latch onto anything? All it does
is go &#8217;blip, blip, blip&#8217; in the mind. We now see it more clearly and focus
our investigation on it, scratch away at it, dig away at it with mindfulness
and discernment until we have it surrounded every time the mind makes a
move. There are no longer any lapses in alertness as there were in the first
stages when mindfulness and discernment were still stumbling and crawling
along.
<!--l. 64032--><p class="indent" >   Our persistence at this level is no longer a matter of every activity. It becomes a
matter of every mental moment in which the mind ripples. Mindfulness and
discernment have to know both when the rippling comes out and when it vanishes &#8212;
and so there are no issues that can arise in the moment the mind is fashioning a
thought, an assumption, or an interpretation. This is because our rocket-fast
mindfulness and discernment can keep up with things. As soon as a rippling

occurs, we know. When we know, it vanishes. No issues can arise or connect.
They vanish the moment they appear. They can&#8217;t branch out anywhere
because the bridges to outside matters have been cut by mindfulness and
discernment.
<!--l. 64044--><p class="indent" >   When mindfulness and discernment are exploring earnestly, relentlessly,
unflaggingly, they want to know, to see, and to destroy whatever is hazardous. &#8217;What
causes us to take birth as individuals and beings? What leads us to wander in the
round of rebirth? What are the causes, what are the conditions that connect things?
Where are they right now?&#8217; This is called scratching away with mindfulness and
discernment, digging away at the mind of unawareness. There is no way we can
escape knowing, seeing, and severing the important cause and condition that creates
suffering and stress for the beings of the world: namely, the defilement of
unawareness that has infiltrated the mind in an insidious way. See? This
is the power of mindfulness, discernment, conviction, and persistence on
this level, something that meditators never imagine will be possible to this
extent.
<!--l. 64058--><p class="indent" >   This is where defilements begin to reveal themselves, because they have no place
to hide. They no longer have the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations
in which they used to hole up, because the bridges have been cut. Their only hideout
is in the mind: The mind is the hideout of unawareness. When we go ransacking
through the mind until everything is smashed completely to smithereens with
nothing left &#8212; in the same way that we used discernment to investigate
phenomena in general &#8212; then when the mind of unawareness is ransacked in this
way, ultimately the supreme defilement &#8212; unawareness, the emperor of
the round of rebirth &#8212; is completely obliterated from the mind. At this
point, how can we help but know what it is that causes birth on this or
that level? As for where we will or won&#8217;t be reborn, that&#8217;s not important.
What&#8217;s important is seeing clearly that this is what has caused birth and
death.
<!--l. 64074--><p class="indent" >   This is how we prove whether death is followed by rebirth or annihilation. We
have to prove it at the mind by practicing in line with the principles of mental
development, in the same way the Buddha and his Noble Disciples practiced and
knew so that it was clear to their hearts. There is no other way to know. Don&#8217;t go
groping, guessing, scratching at fleas. You&#8217;ll end up all mangy and dirty, without
gaining anything at all. When we reach this point, it&#8217;s called eliminating birth &#8212;
whose primary seeds lie within &#8212; completely from the mind. From this
moment onward, there is nothing that can ever again connect and branch out.
Mindfulness and discernment on the level of Dhamma-realization know this
completely.
<!--l. 64086--><p class="indent" >   This is the culprit who asks, &#8217;Is there a next world?&#8217; This is the one who reserves
a place in the next world, the one who reserved our place in past worlds, the one
who has been born and has died over and over and over again, unceasingly,
relentlessly, to the point where it can&#8217;t remember the births, the deaths, the
pleasures, the pains, the sufferings large and small in its various lives. This is the
one.
<!--l. 64093--><p class="indent" >   So please remember its face and take it to heart. Probe it and slash it away to

smithereens. Don&#8217;t show it any mercy: You&#8217;ll simply be feeding and fattening it for it
to come back and destroy you.
<!--l. 64097--><p class="indent" >   When we gather the defilements, they come into the one mind. They gather here
and we destroy them right here. Once we have finished destroying them so that
nothing is left, the questions about birth, death, and the suffering and stress that
result from birth and death no longer exist. We can know this clearly and fully for
ourselves in a way that is immediately apparent.
<!--l. 64104--><p class="indent" >   There is no more problem about whether or not there is a next world.
Our past worlds, we have already abandoned. As for the next world, the
bridges have all been sent flying. And as for the present, we&#8217;re wise to it.
There are no conventions, no matter now refined, left in the mind. This is
truly a mind with no more problems. This is where we solve the mind&#8217;s
problems. Once they are all solved here, there will never be any problems
again.
<!--l. 64112--><p class="indent" >   No matter how wide the world, no matter how many universes there are, they are
all a matter of conventional reality, which has no limit. The heart that knows all
around itself is no longer involved.
<!--l. 64116--><p class="indent" >   The affairs that have been constantly assaulting us up to the present, and that
will do so on into the future, are the affairs of this mind that has hazards buried
within itself. That&#8217;s all there is. When these hazards have been entirely removed,
there is nothing left to be dangerous or poisonous ever again. The question of
whether or not there is a next world no longer holds any interest, because the
realization has gone straight to the heart that it is done with the question of
connecting up with any other world again. So in studying and solving our own
problem, we tackle it right here. This way there&#8217;s hope that we can put an end to
it &#8212; at the same time not causing any harm to ourselves or to others at
all.
<!--l. 64128--><p class="indent" >   The Lord Buddha solved the problem right here. His arahant disciples solved
it right here &#8212; knew it right here, severed it completely right here. The
proclamation that the Teacher was completely free of suffering and stress,
that he was the foremost teacher of the world, came from this knowledge
and this freedom from issues. Our study of the world is completed right
here at the mind. Our study of the Dhamma reaches full completion right
here.
<!--l. 64136--><p class="indent" >   The &#8217;world&#8217; means the world of living beings. &#8217;Living beings&#8217; (satta) means
those who are caught up, caught up right at the mind. This is where we
cut through the problem. This is where we study and know. The arahant
disciples studied and knew right here with their full hearts &#8212; and that was the
end of the problem. They solved the problem and it fell away, with nothing
remaining.
<!--l. 64143--><p class="indent" >   But as for us, we take on the whole thing: the entire heap of suffering and stress.
We take on all problems, but we aren&#8217;t willing to solve them. We simply hoard them
to weigh ourselves down all the time. Our heart is thus filled with a heap of stress
that nothing else can equal, because nothing else is as heavy as a heart heaped with
stress. Carrying this heap of stress and problems is heavy on the heart because we
haven&#8217;t completed our studies. We carry nothing but this heap because of our

delusion.
<!--l. 64152--><p class="indent" >   When vijja &#8212; true knowledge &#8212; has appeared and eradicated all the
hazards from the heart, this is what it means to &#8217;graduate&#8217; in line with natural
principles, with none of the conferring of degrees or titles that would cause us to
become even more deluded. To complete our study of the Dhamma in the
heart means that we have erased it completely of all delusion, with no traces
remaining.
<!--l. 64159--><p class="indent" >   At that moment, the three levels of existence &#8212; the levels of sensuality, form, and
formlessness &#8212; become no more problem, because they all lie in the heart.
The level of sensuality is a mind composed of sensuality. The levels of form
and formlessness are the conventions of the various things in those levels
buried in the heart. When the heart removes them, that&#8217;s the end of the
problem. When we solve the problem, this is where we solve it. This world
and the next world lie right here, because that which steps into any world
lies right here. This mind is what steps out to receive stress in greater or
lesser measure. The motor, the propeller, lies here in the heart and nowhere
else.
<!--l. 64171--><p class="indent" >   The Lord Buddha thus taught at the right point, the most appropriate point: the
heart, which is the primary culprit. The things I have mentioned here, with whom do
they lie if not with each of us? And if we don&#8217;t solve them right here, where will we
solve them?
<!--l. 64176--><p class="indent" >   Living beings have to go to their various worlds through the power of the good
and bad kamma within the heart. That which goes to the worlds &#8212; to the bonfires &#8212;
is this very heart. If we don&#8217;t solve the problem right here, there is no way of
escaping the bonfires of stress and anxiety. If we solve the problem right here, there is
no problem as to where the fires are, because we can keep ourselves protected. That&#8217;s
all there is to it!
<!--l. 64184--><p class="indent" >   All of these things are very heavy worlds for living beings in general. Whatever
problems arise, they arise right here. &#8217;Is death followed by rebirth? By annihilation?
Is there a next world? Does hell exist? Does heaven? Does evil exist? Does merit?&#8217;
Everywhere I go, there&#8217;s the same question: &#8217;Do heaven and hell exist?&#8217; I never feel
like answering. I don&#8217;t see any reason to answer it, because that which is
burdened with heaven and hell is the heart, which everyone already has. So why
waste time answering? After all, I&#8217;m not a record-keeper for heaven and
hell!
<!--l. 64194--><p class="indent" >   Straighten things out right here at the cause that will go to heaven and hell.
Straighten out the bad causes and foster the good. There will then be no stress, if we
straighten things out right on target. And how can we miss? The well-taught
Dhamma (svakkhata-dhamma) teaches us to solve things right on target,
not off-target. The Dhamma that leads (niyyanika-dhamma) by means of
the well-taught Dhamma, leads out those who are caught up in stress and
anxiety through the power of delusion. Where will we solve things if we
don&#8217;t solve them at the heart? The big problems lie solely at the heart, at
this awareness. Crudeness is a matter of this awareness. Refinement is a
matter of this awareness. That which makes people crude or refined is this
awareness, with defilement as the reinforcement. If the mind becomes refined,

it&#8217;s because goodness is the reinforcement, making it refined until it goes
beyond the final point of refinement, beyond the final point of conventions,
and ends up gaining release from all stress, with no seeds for any further
connections.
<!--l. 64211--><p class="indent" >   Another question that people are always asking is how to overcome laziness. If we
were to tell them to use laziness to overcome laziness, it would be tantamount to
telling them to become an enemy of beds, blankets, and pillows by sleeping without
ever waking up. It would be as if they were already dead, because laziness makes you
weak and listless like a person ready to die. How can you use laziness to cure
laziness? Once you get a nice resting place as a means of lulling you to drown in
sleep, it&#8217;s as if you were already dead &#8212; dead right there on the pillow! Even when
you wake up, you don&#8217;t want to get up, because laziness stomps all over you and
destroys you, forcing you not to get up. This is how it goes when you use laziness to
cure laziness.
<!--l. 64224--><p class="indent" >   If you use energy and persistence to cure laziness, then you get right up, ready to
fight. If there&#8217;s a fight, you have hope of winning. But if you simply lie prostrate, all
you can do is lose &#8212; although whether we should call it losing or something else is
hard to say, because you don&#8217;t even put up a fight at all, so how can you say that you
lose? If there&#8217;s a fight and you can&#8217;t win, then you can say that this person wins
and that person loses. But here there&#8217;s no fight at all! You simply lie there
groveling. If you don&#8217;t call this being a servant in the house of defilements, what
would you call it? Because that&#8217;s what it is: being a servant in their house. If
you use laziness &#8212; to the point of being its servant &#8212; to cure defilement,
you end up piling on even more defilements. Or what would you say? As
things stand, defilements already fill the heart, so if you foster them even
more, where are you going to put them? You&#8217;ve got only one heart! The only
way is to remove defilements so that you can begin to breathe, and not
let them sit on top of your nose so that you can never gasp a breath at
all.
<!--l. 64242--><p class="indent" >   Remove them so that you can begin to see yourself: &#8217;At last, after all the time I&#8217;ve
been meditating, I&#8217;ve finally seen a piece of defilement&#8217;s grandchild &#8212; laziness &#8212; fall
off, just like a chip of bark off a tree. Today at last I can begin to see myself. Up to
now there&#8217;s only been defilement making use of my nose and mouth. It&#8217;s really
infuriating!&#8217;
<!--l. 64249--><p class="indent" >   Persistence. Diligence. Exertion in the way of reason that can accomplish our
purposes: This is the path that sages have followed. Even though it may be difficult,
we&#8217;re up to the fight. It&#8217;s like removing a thorn from your foot: Even though it hurts
to remove it, you have to bear it. If you let it stay there, your whole foot
will become infected and putrid. You won&#8217;t be able to walk at all, and may
even lose the foot. So there&#8217;s only one reasonable course: Pull it out. No
matter how much it hurts, you have to bear it, because you have to get the
thing out! This is a line of reasoning you have to accept. Once the thorn
is out, it holds no more poison. Put medicine on the wound, and the foot
will heal without flaring up as it would if the thorn were still embedded
there.
<!--l. 64262--><p class="indent" >   Defilement is just like a thorn. We let it lie buried forever in the heart. As long

as it remains, the heart is infected and putrid, there in the midst of the
round of rebirth &#8212; an endless monotony. Is this what you want? To be
a putrid person? Ask yourself. Don&#8217;t ask the defilements. They&#8217;ll simply
do you more harm. If you don&#8217;t want this, you have to fight them. Once
you fight them, you are sure somehow of finding a way to win. No matter
how many times you lose, there will have to come a time when you win.
Once you&#8217;ve won, then you can keep on winning, winning and winning until
there is nothing left for you to fight because the defilements are completely
mauled.
<!--l. 64273--><p class="indent" >   When you win, whom do you defeat? You defeat laziness with diligence. You
defeat defilement with energy and persistence. This way you gain release from all
stress. This is how you solve the problem of birth and death, right at the heart.
There is only this spot that most needs solving. It&#8217;s the most appropriate spot, the
most correct spot to solve. To solve things, you solve them here. There is no way you
can solve them anywhere else. Keep on making assumptions and interpretations
for aeons and aeons, and you&#8217;ll simply continue to be burdened with the
problem as it leads you to birth, death, suffering, and stress. So you shouldn&#8217;t
be bold in speculating and guessing, or you&#8217;ll waste your time and die in
vain, because there is no way the problem will be solved with guesses and
speculations.
<!--l. 64286--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Does suffering exist, or not? Do merit (puñña) and evil exist, or not?&#8217; Actually,
we are experiencing these things, all of us, with no possible exceptions. &#8217;Evil&#8217; is
mental darkness and stress. &#8217;Merit&#8217; is well-being and ease. These things exist in the
body and mind of every person, so how can you deny them? &#8217;Merit&#8217; is a name for
well-being. The Buddha calls it merit. Stress he calls evil. We are touched by good
and evil all the time. Whether we live in this world or the next, we can&#8217;t help but
meet with good and evil.
<!--l. 64295--><p class="indent" >   Hell or not-hell, if there&#8217;s pain filling the body and mind, who wants it?
Who wants to meet with it? This is something we all know, so why ask
about hell when it&#8217;s already with us like this? Wherever pain is burning us,
it&#8217;s as hot as being branded with fire. No matter where you&#8217;re branded, it
all has to be hot in the same way. You can call it hell or not-hell as you
like, but nobody wants it, because pain is something we have all known for
ourselves.
<!--l. 64303--><p class="indent" >   And where &#8212; to trouble your heart &#8212; are you going to go looking for heaven?
When you meet with the well-being that comes from practicing the Dhamma &#8212; and
especially with well-being in the heart, beginning with stillness and calm in ascending
stages to the point where the mind develops a firm and solid footing within, so that
it is sure of itself; and then further, to the point where you gain release
&#8212; then where are you going to ask about heaven and nibbana?There&#8217;s no
need to ask. You know them directly with your heart. You are the owner,
in charge of the heart that is clearly the instigator, so where else are you
going to look &#8212; for the names &#8217;heaven&#8217; and &#8217;hell&#8217;? What is there to grope
for?
<!--l. 64316--><p class="indent" >   You&#8217;ve got the real thing within you. That&#8217;s all there is to the matter. The
Dhamma of the Lord Buddha doesn&#8217;t delude people into groping for this or that. So

take hold of the real thing right here.
<!--l. 64320--><p class="indent" >   Well then. That should be enough for now.
<!--l. 64322--><p class="indent" >   A Taste for the Dhamma
<!--l. 64324--><p class="indent" >   In the basic principles of the doctrine, we are taught that, &#8217;A delight in the
Dhamma surpasses all other delights. The flavor of the Dhamma surpasses all other
flavors.&#8217; This statement was made by a person who had felt delight in the true
Dhamma, who had tasted the flavor of the true Dhamma: namely, our Lord Buddha.
For this reason, those who take an interest in listening to his teachings find that no
matter what the statement, each word, each sentence goes straight to the heart &#8212;
except, of course, for people who are simply going through the motions of
listening without focusing the mind, letting it drift engrossed in various
things in line with its original inclinations without gaining anything of any
worth.
<!--l. 64336--><p class="indent" >   The teachings of the religion have no meaning in a mind of this sort until it turns
to the Dhamma, develops an interest of its own accord, and puts the Dhamma into
practice. Only then will the flavor of the Dhamma seep deep into the heart,
nurturing it and giving rise to conviction step by step. This is because the heart
now has a continuing basis for the Dhamma that supports it in ascending
stages.
<!--l. 64343--><p class="indent" >   In particular, when listening to Dhamma dealing with the practice, if our mind
doesn&#8217;t have any experience with meditation, has never taken an interest in
the Dhamma, has never taken an interest in practicing the Dhamma, then
not even a single statement will arrest the attention. When listening to a
talk on the practice dealing with the stages of the mind, the progress of
the mind, setting the mind aright in relationship to the defilements or to
the path &#8212; mindfulness and discernment, or persistent effort &#8212; we won&#8217;t
understand. When we don&#8217;t understand, we become frustrated and turn our
attention elsewhere. Perhaps we may become drowsy and want to go to
sleep or something of the sort. The talk seems long because it acts as a drag
on our defilements, preventing them from roaming around as they please.
This is because we have to keep control over the mind while we listen to the
talk; and the mind, when kept under control in this way, feels hemmed in,
imprisoned within limits it finds oppressive. Annoyed and bored, it doesn&#8217;t want
to listen, except for the purpose of creating useless issues for entangling
itself.
<!--l. 64361--><p class="indent" >   But when we keep listening with interest, meditating even while we listen, the
mind becomes focused and follows along with the stream of Dhamma being
explained. The mind grows still because the awareness making contact with
the Dhamma maintains that contact continuously, step by step, without
break. The heart has no chance to slip away to any other preoccupations
that are its enemies while listening, and so it&#8217;s able to settle down and be
still.
<!--l. 64369--><p class="indent" >   To be able to settle down in this way is to begin building a base, or to scrub our
vessel &#8212; the heart &#8212; making it clean and fit to receive the Dhamma. The heart will
start growing more peaceful and calm, seeing the value of listening to the Dhamma as
explained by the Buddha: &#8217;Listening to the Dhamma has five rewards.&#8217; The fifth

reward is the important one: &#8217;The mind of the listener becomes radiant and
calm.&#8217; This one is very important, but it must build on the earlier ones. &#8217;The
listener hears things he or she has never heard&#8217; &#8212; this is the basis for the
rest.
<!--l. 64379--><p class="indent" >   Suppose that we have never listened to anything in the way of the practice or
whatever. When we come to listen, we gain an understanding of things we have never
heard before. Things that we have heard before, but never understood clearly, we
gradually come to understand more and more clearly. We can bring our views more
correctly into line. And finally we reach the stage where &#8217;the mind of the listener
becomes radiant and calm.&#8217; When results of this sort appear, a delight in the
Dhamma will develop of its own accord. The flavor of the Dhamma will
begin to appear while we listen and while the mind is stilling itself to listen.
Even though this flavor may not yet surpass all others, it is nevertheless
absorbing and arresting, and will remain long in the memory, not easily
erased.
<!--l. 64392--><p class="indent" >   This is why meditators place great importance on listening to the Dhamma. If
you were to call it being attached to one&#8217;s teacher, I wouldn&#8217;t disagree. Meditating
monks always like to listen to their teachers. If they have a teacher they venerate and
revere in the area of meditation, in the area of the mind, then wherever he lives they
will keep coming to be with him until there is hardly enough room for them to
stay.
<!--l. 64400--><p class="indent" >   Venerable Acariya Mun is an example. Wherever he stayed, students
would come continually from near and far to search him out. Even though
they couldn&#8217;t all stay in the same place with him, inasmuch as there wasn&#8217;t
enough room, they would still be willing to stay in nearby areas, two, three,
four, or seven to eight kilometers away, so that they might conveniently
come to hear his teachings on the uposatha days and &#8217;Dhamma meeting&#8217;
days.
<!--l. 64408--><p class="indent" >   On the uposatha days, after listening to the Patimokkha and to his instructions,
anyone who had any doubts or questions about the Dhamma could ask him to resolve
them. For this reason, the township where he stayed was filled with nothing but
meditating monks and novices. When uposatha day came, they would begin
gathering together after the morning meal. At 1:00 p.m. they would hear the
Patimokkha; and after the Patimokkha, Venerable Acariya Mun would give his
talk &#8212; that&#8217;s when he&#8217;d usually give his talk, after the Patimokkha. This
would be an important part of the practice for those who lived with him.
During the Rains Retreat (vassa) we would meet like this every seven days.
Outside of the Rains Retreat, the schedule wasn&#8217;t too fixed, but this is how
he would usually schedule things for those of us who stayed directly with
him. Each time we would listen to his talks we would gain in insight and
understanding &#8212; without fail. This is why meditation monks are attached to their
teachers.
<!--l. 64424--><p class="indent" >   Each time we would listen to him, he himself would be like a magnet drawing the
interest of the monks and novices. In all things related to the Dhamma,
he would be the major attracting force, inspiring fascination and delight
in the Dhamma. There was a delight in seeing him and meeting him each

time, and even more so in hearing him speak &#8212; talking in general, giving
instructions, conversing about ordinary things, joking &#8212; because he himself was
entirely Dhamma. Everything he would do or say in any way would keep
revealing Dhamma and reasonability that could be taken as a lesson, so
that those who were interested could gain a lesson each time they heard
him.
<!--l. 64435--><p class="indent" >   This is why meditating monks find a great deal of enjoyment in the area of the
Dhamma by living with a meditation master. They go to be with him of their own
accord. When they are far from him, and their minds aren&#8217;t yet to the stage where
they can look after themselves, they are bound to feel lonesome. Or if they
come across a problem they can&#8217;t solve, they are sure to miss him. If they
can&#8217;t work out a solution, they have to run to him for advice so as to save a
great deal of the time it would take to figure out a solution on their own &#8212;
because he has been through everything of every sort. If we would take a
problem to him, then as soon as we had finished the last sentence, he would
immediately have the solution and we would understand right then and
there.
<!--l. 64448--><p class="indent" >   This is why, when living with a master who has realized the truth, there&#8217;s no
delay, no waste of time in dealing with each problem as it arises. This is a great
benefit for those who come to study with him. They&#8217;re never disappointed. The fact
that one who has seen the truth is giving the explanation makes all the
difference.
<!--l. 64454--><p class="indent" >   A moment ago I began by mentioning a delight in the Dhamma. What I have just
been talking about is the same sort of thing: finding pleasure in the Dhamma,
continual pleasure, through listening to it constantly. In the same way, when we
practice the Dhamma constantly, the results &#8212; the flavor and nourishment that come
from the practice &#8212; increase continually, becoming more and more solid and
substantial in the heart.
<!--l. 64462--><p class="indent" >   Especially in the practice of centering the mind: The mind is calm, tranquil,
contented, and relaxed. Its thoughts don&#8217;t go meddling with anything outside. It&#8217;s as
if the world didn&#8217;t exist, because our attention isn&#8217;t involved with it. There&#8217;s simply
the Dhamma to be contemplated and practiced so as to give rise to more and more
steadiness and strength.
<!--l. 64468--><p class="indent" >   And on the level of discernment, no matter how broad or narrow our investigation
of the many phenomena in the world may be, it is exclusively for the sake of the
Dhamma, for the sake of self-liberation. We thus become thoroughly engrossed, day
and night. The more strongly our heart is set on the Dhamma, the greater
its stamina and courage. It has no concern for life itself, no worries about
its living conditions or anything external. Its only support is the guiding
compass of the Dhamma. Whether we are sitting, lying down, or whatever,
the heart is engrossed in its persistent efforts in practicing the Dhamma.
On the level of concentration, it is engrossed in its stillness of mind. On
the level of discernment, it is engrossed in its explorations of the Dhamma
from various angles for the sake of removing defilement, step by step, as it
investigates.
<!--l. 64482--><p class="indent" >   Peace of heart is thus possible in each stage of persisting with the practice. The

more quiet and secluded the place, the more conspicuously this awareness stands out.
Even knowledge in the area of concentration stands out in our inner awareness. It
stands out for its stillness. In the area of discernment, our knowledge stands out for
the shrewdness and ingenuity of the mind as it explores without ceasing &#8212;
except when resting in the stillness of concentration &#8212; just as water from
an artesian well flows without ceasing during both the wet season and the
dry.
<!--l. 64492--><p class="indent" >   When phenomena make contact with the mind &#8212; or even when they
don&#8217;t &#8212; a mind already inclined to discernment is bound to investigate,
peering into every nook and cranny, gaining understanding step by step.
For example, when we are first taught mindfulness immersed in the body
(kayagata-sati), it seems superficial &#8212; because the mind is superficial. It has no
footing, no mindfulness, no discernment. It hasn&#8217;t any principles &#8212; any
Dhamma &#8212; to hold to. Whatever it hears doesn&#8217;t really go straight to the
heart, because the mind is buried way down there, deep under the belly of
defilement.
<!--l. 64503--><p class="indent" >   But once it develops principles and reasonability within itself, then &#8212; especially
when we&#8217;re sitting in meditation in a quiet place, investigating the body &#8212;
the whole body seems clear all the way through. That&#8217;s how it really feels
to a person meditating on this level. It&#8217;s really enthralling. Whether we&#8217;re
contemplating the skin or the body&#8217;s unattractiveness, it appears extremely
clear, because that&#8217;s the way its nature already is &#8212; simply that our mind
hasn&#8217;t fallen in step with the truth and so is constantly taking issue with
it.
<!--l. 64513--><p class="indent" >   So. Now that the mind can develop stillness and investigate using its discernment,
let&#8217;s take it on a meditation tour, exploring the body: our five khandhas. We can
travel up to the head, down to the feet, out to the skin, into the muscles,
tendons, and bones to see how all the parts are related and connected by their
nature.
<!--l. 64519--><p class="indent" >   As the mind contemplates in this way, step by step, as it gets engrossed in its
investigation, the final result is that even though we&#8217;re investigating the body, the
body doesn&#8217;t appear in our inner sense of feeling at all. The mind feels airy and light.
The physical body disappears, despite the fact that we continue investigating the
mental image of the body as before. Even though we&#8217;re using the mental image of the
body as the focal point of our investigation, the physical aspect of the body
no longer appears. It completely vanishes. We investigate until there&#8217;s a
refinement in the mind&#8217;s sense of awareness to the point where we can make
the body in the image die and disintegrate, step by step. Our awareness
is confined solely to the mental image that we are investigating by means
of discernment. We see it distinctly because nothing else is coming in to
interfere.
<!--l. 64533--><p class="indent" >   The mind feels no hunger or desire to go skipping outside. It&#8217;s completely
engrossed in its work of investigation. Its understanding grows clearer and clearer.
The clearer its understanding, the greater its fascination. Ultimately there is
simply the mental image, or the idea, and the mind, or discernment. As for
the actual body, it disappears. You don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s gone. There&#8217;s

no sense of the body at that moment, even though you are investigating
the body until you see its condition disintegrating clearly within the mind
&#8212; disintegrating until it returns to its original condition as the elements
of earth, water, wind, and fire. Once the body in the image returns to its
original elements, the mind then withdraws inward, leaving nothing but simple
awareness.
<!--l. 64546--><p class="indent" >   Feelings all disappear at this stage. Sañña, sankhara, and viññana aren&#8217;t involved.
There&#8217;s simply awareness, sufficient for the mind&#8217;s state at that moment. It enters a
really solid stillness, leaving only simple awareness. The body sitting here disappears
entirely.
<!--l. 64551--><p class="indent" >   This is something that can occur in the course of investigating, but please don&#8217;t
plan on it. Simply listen now for the sake of becoming absorbed and gladdened while
listening. This will give rise to the benefits of listening that you will actually see for
yourself.
<!--l. 64556--><p class="indent" >   What will happen when you investigate in line with your own personal traits is a
completely individual matter that will appear in keeping with your temperament.
As for what occurs with other people, you can&#8217;t make yourself experience
what they do, know the way they know, or see the way they see. This is
something that depends on each person&#8217;s individual traits. Let things follow your
own inner nature in line with the way you are able to investigate and to
know.
<!--l. 64564--><p class="indent" >   This is one point I want to explain.
<!--l. 64566--><p class="indent" >   A second point: When investigating the body in terms of inconstancy, stress, and
not-self, then &#8212; whether or not you think, &#8217;inconstancy, stress, and not-self&#8217; &#8212; when
discernment makes clear contact with the bodily khandha, it will be able to know
these things on its own, because things that are inconstant, stressful, and not-self are
things that deserve to be relinquished, that inspire dispassion and disenchantment,
step by step, until you let go. When the mind has investigated so that it
fully understands, it lets go of its own accord without being forced, because
each part, each aspect of the body or of the khandha being investigated
is simply an individual truth. When the mind investigates clearly in this
way, it makes the break automatically, because a truth has encountered a
truth: The mind is the mind, and each of these individual conditions is a
separate condition that hasn&#8217;t come to involve itself with the mind at all. The
mind will then turn around to see its own fault in being attached. &#8217;Here I&#8217;ve
really been deluded. Actually things are like this and this.&#8217; This is one stage:
When the mind hasn&#8217;t yet made a complete break &#8212; when it doesn&#8217;t yet
have adequate strength &#8212; it will start out by knowing at intervals in this
way.
<!--l. 64586--><p class="indent" >   The next time you investigate, you know in this way again and it keeps seeping
in, seeping in, until your knowledge on this level becomes adequate and lets go. Like
duckweed that keeps moving in, moving in to cover the water: After you spread it
apart, the duckweed comes moving in again, and you spread it apart again. This is
how it is when discernment investigates these things, making forays into these things
or unraveling them. As soon as discernment retreats, subtle defilements come
moving in again, but after you have investigated many, many times, the

duckweed &#8212; the various types of defilement &#8212; begins to thin out. Your
investigation of these phenomena becomes more and more effortless, more and more
proficient, more and more subtle, step by step, until it reaches a point of
sufficiency and the mind extricates itself automatically, as I have already
explained.
<!--l. 64600--><p class="indent" >   The mind &#8212; when its mindfulness and discernment are sufficiently strong &#8212; can
extricate itself once and for all. This knowledge is clear to it, without any need to ask
anyone else ever again. The heart is sufficient, in and of itself, and sees clearly as
&#8217;sanditthiko&#8217; in the full sense of the term, as proclaimed by the Dhamma, without
any issues to invite contradiction.
<!--l. 64607--><p class="indent" >   A third point: Sometimes, when investigating the body, the mind makes contact
with a feeling of pain, and so turns to investigate it. This all depends on the mind&#8217;s
temperament. In the same way, when we turn to investigate the feeling, the mind
sends us back to the body. This is because the body and the feeling are interrelated
and so must be investigated together at the same time, depending on what comes
naturally to us at that particular time, that particular feeling, and that particular
part of the body.
<!--l. 64616--><p class="indent" >   When the mind investigates a feeling of pain, the pain is nothing more
than &#8217;a pain.&#8217; The mind looks at it, fixes its attention on it, examines it,
and then lets it go right there, turning to look at the body. The body is
the body. The feeling is a feeling. Then we turn to look at the mind: The
mind is the mind. We investigate and experiment to find the truth of the
body, the feeling, and the mind &#8212; all three of which are the troublemakers
&#8212; until we have a solid understanding of how each has its own separate
reality.
<!--l. 64625--><p class="indent" >   When the mind pulls back from the body and the feeling, neither the body nor
the feeling appears. All that appears is simple awareness. When a mental current
flashes out to know, the feeling then appears as a feeling. These currents are the
means by which we know what phenomenon has appeared, because this
knowledge gives a meaning or a label to the phenomenon as being like this or like
that.
<!--l. 64632--><p class="indent" >   If we&#8217;re going to think in a way that binds us to &#8217;ourself&#8217; &#8212; in other words, in the
way of the origin of stress &#8212; we have to make use of this act of labeling as what
leads us to grasp, to become attached, to make various assumptions and
interpretations. If we&#8217;re going to think in the way of discernment, we have to
make use of the discernment that is this very same current of the mind to
investigate, contemplate, until we see clearly by means of discernment and can
withdraw inwardly in a way that is full of reason &#8212; not in a way that is lazy
or weak, or that is groveling in abject surrender with no gumption left to
fight.
<!--l. 64643--><p class="indent" >   In investigating feeling, when a sañña flashes out, mindfulness is alert to it. If our
investigation of feeling has become refined and precise, then when a sañña
simply flashes out, we know. When sankharas form, they are just like fireflies:
blip! If no sañña labels them or picks up where they leave off, they simply
form &#8212; blip! blip! &#8212; and then vanish, vanish. No matter what they form
&#8212; good thoughts, bad thoughts, crude thoughts, subtle thoughts, neutral

thoughts, whatever &#8212; they are simply a rippling of the mind. If they occur on
their own, when nothing is making contact with the mind, they&#8217;re called
sankhara. If they occur when something is making contact, they&#8217;re called
viññana.
<!--l. 64655--><p class="indent" >   Here we&#8217;re talking about the sankharas that form on their own, without anything
else being involved. They form &#8212; blip &#8212; and then vanish immediately. Blip &#8212; and
then vanish immediately. We can see this clearly when the mind converges snugly in
the subtle levels of concentration and discernment.
<!--l. 64661--><p class="indent" >   The snugness of the mind&#8217;s convergence won&#8217;t have anything else involved with it
at all. All that remains is simple awareness. When this simple awareness remains
stable this way, we will see clearly that it isn&#8217;t paired with anything else. When
the mind begins to withdraw from this state to return to its awareness of
phenomena &#8212; returning to its ordinary state of mind that can think and form
thoughts &#8212; there will be a rippling &#8212; blip &#8212; that vanishes immediately. It will
then be empty as before. In a moment it will &#8217;blip&#8217; again. The mind will
form just a flash of a thought that doesn&#8217;t yet amount to anything, just
a rippling that vanishes immediately the instant it&#8217;s known. As soon as
there&#8217;s a rippling, we are alert to it because of the power of mindfulness
keeping watch at the moment &#8212; or because of the strength of concentration
that hasn&#8217;t yet dissipated. But after these ripples have formed two or three
times, they come more and more frequently, and soon we return to ordinary
consciousness, just as when a baby awakens from sleep: At first it fidgets
a bit, and then after this happens a number of times, it finally opens its
eyes.
<!--l. 64680--><p class="indent" >   The same is true of the mind. It has calm... Here I&#8217;m talking about concentration
when discernment is there with it. The various ways of investigating I have
mentioned are all classed as discernment. When we have investigated enough, the
mind enters stillness, free from mental formations and fashionings and from any sort
of disturbance. All that appears is awareness. Even just this has the full
flavor of a centered mind, which should already be enough to surpass all
other flavors. We never tire of delighting in this stillness. We feel a constant
attraction to this stillness and calm in the heart. Wherever we go, wherever
we stay, the mind has its own foundation. The heart is at ease, quiet and
calm, so that now we must use discernment to investigate the elements and
khandhas.
<!--l. 64693--><p class="indent" >   The important point to notice is the act of formation in the mind. Once
something is formed, sañña immediately labels it &#8212; as if sankhara were forming
things to hand on to sañña, which takes up where the sankhara leaves off. It then
interprets these things from various angles &#8212; and this is where we get deluded. We
fall for our own assumptions and interpretations, for our own shadows, which paint
picture stories that have us engrossed or upset both day and night. Why are we
engrossed? Why are we upset?
<!--l. 64702--><p class="indent" >   Engrossed or upset, it&#8217;s because of the mind&#8217;s shadows acting out stories and
issues. This story. That story. Future issues. Things yet to come. Things yet to exist
&#8212; nothing butthe mind painting pictures to delude itself. We live in our
thought-formations, our picture-painting &#8212; engrossed and upset by nothing but our

own thought-formations, our own picture-painting. In a single day there&#8217;s not a
moment when we&#8217;re free from painting imaginary pictures to agitate and fool
ourselves. Wise people, though, can keep up with the tricks and deceits of the
khandhas, which is why they aren&#8217;t deluded.
<!--l. 64712--><p class="indent" >   The moment when mindfulness and discernment really penetrate down is when
we can know that this is actually the way the mind usually is. Like people
who have never meditated: When they start meditating, they send their
minds astray, without anything to hold on to. For example, they may have a
meditation word, like &#8217;buddho,&#8217; and there they sit &#8212; their eyes vacant, looking at
who-knows-what. But their minds are thinking and painting 108 pictures
with endless captions. They then become engrossed with them or wander
aimlessly in line with the preoccupations they invent for themselves, falling
for their preoccupations more than actually focusing on their meditation.
They thus find it hard to settle their minds down because they don&#8217;t have
enough mindfulness supervising the work of meditation to make them settle
down.
<!--l. 64726--><p class="indent" >   Once we have used our alertness and ingenuity in the areas of concentration and
discernment, we will come to know clearly that these conditions come from the mind
and then delude the mind whose mindfulness and discernment aren&#8217;t quick enough to
keep up with them. The heart causes us to follow after them deludedly, so that we
can&#8217;t find any peace of mind at all, even though our original aim was to meditate to
find peace of mind. These deceptive thoughts engender love, hate, anger,
irritation, without letup, no matter whether we are meditators or not &#8212;
because as meditators we haven&#8217;t set up mindfulness to supervise our hearts,
and the result is that we&#8217;re just as insane with our thoughts as anyone else.
Old Grandfather Boowa has been insane this way himself, and that&#8217;s no
joke!
<!--l. 64739--><p class="indent" >   Sometimes, no matter how many years in the past a certain issue may lie, this
aimless, drifting heart wanders until it meets up with it and revives it. If
it was something that made us sad, we become sad about it again, all on
our own. We keep it smoldering and think it back to life, even though we
don&#8217;t know where the issue lay hidden in the meantime. These are simply
the mind&#8217;s own shadows deceiving it until they seem to take on substance
and shape. As what? As anger, greed, anxiety, pain, insanity, all coming
from these shadows. What sort of &#8217;path&#8217; or &#8217;fruition&#8217; is this? Paths and
fruitions like this are so heaped all over the world that we can&#8217;t find any way
out.
<!--l. 64750--><p class="indent" >   So in investigating the acts of the mind, the important point is that discernment
be quick to keep up with their vagrant ways. When mindfulness and discernment are
quick enough, then whatever forms in the mind, we will see that it comes from the
mind itself, which is about to paint pictures to deceive itself, about to label and
interpret sights, sounds, smells, and tastes of various kinds. The heart is then up on
these preoccupations; and when it is up on them, they vanish immediately, with no
chance of taking on substance or shape, of becoming issues or affairs. This is
because mindfulness and discernment are wise to them, and so the issues are
resolved.

<!--l. 64761--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately, we come to see the harm of which the mind is the sole cause. We
don&#8217;t praise or blame sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations at all. The
heart turns and sees the harm that arises in the mind that deceives itself,
saying, &#8217;That&#8217;s worth praising... worth criticizing... worth getting glad about...
worth getting sad about.&#8217; It sees that the blame lies entirely with the mind.
This mind is a cheat, a fraud, a deceiver. If we study it and keep watch
of its ways through meditation, we will gain a thorough knowledge of its
good and evil doings, until it lies within our grasp and can&#8217;t escape us at
all.
<!--l. 64772--><p class="indent" >   This is how we investigate when we investigate the mind.
<!--l. 64774--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately, other things will come to have no meaning or importance for us. The
only important thing is this deceiving mind, so we must investigate this deceiver
with mindfulness and discernment so that we can be wise to its tricks and
deceits.
<!--l. 64779--><p class="indent" >   In fixing our attention on the mind, we have to act as if it were a culprit.
Wherever it goes, we have to keep watch on it with mindfulness and discernment.
Whatever thoughts it forms, mindfulness and discernment have to keep watch
so as to be up on events. Each event &#8212; serious or not &#8212; keeps vanishing,
vanishing. The heart knows clearly, &#8217;This mind, and nothing else, is the real
culprit.&#8217;
<!--l. 64786--><p class="indent" >   Visual objects aren&#8217;t at fault. They don&#8217;t give benefits or harm. Sounds, smells,
tastes, and tactile sensations don&#8217;t give benefits or harm, because they themselves
aren&#8217;t benefits or harm. Only the mind is what fashions them and dresses
them up so as to deceive itself into being gladdened or saddened, pleased or
pained through the power of the preoccupations that arise only from the
heart. Mindfulness and discernment see more and more clearly into these
things, step by step, and then turn to see that all the fault lies with the mind.
They no longer praise or blame other things as they used to. Once they have
focused solely on the mind, which at the moment is the culprit, the time
won&#8217;t be long before they can catch the culprit and put an end to all our
concerns.
<!--l. 64799--><p class="indent" >   So then. Whatever thoughts that may be formed are all an affair of the mind. The
&#8217;tigers and elephants&#8217; it forms are simply sankharas it produces to deceive itself.
Mindfulness and discernment are up on events every time. Now the current of the
cycle (vatta) keeps spiraling in, day by day, until we can catch the culprit
&#8212; but we can&#8217;t yet sentence him. We are now in the stage of deliberation
to determine his guilt. Only when we can establish the evidence and the
motive can we execute him in accordance with the procedures of &#8217;Dhamma
Penetration.&#8217; This is where we reach the crucial stage in mindfulness and
discernment.
<!--l. 64810--><p class="indent" >   In the beginning, we used the elements and khandhas as our objects of
investigation, cleansing the mind with elements, using them as a whetstone to
sharpen mindfulness and discernment. We cleansed the mind with sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, and tactile sensations, using them as a whetstone to sharpen
mindfulness and discernment; and we cleansed the mind itself with automatic
mindfulness and discernment. Now at this stage we circle exclusively in on the mind.

We don&#8217;t pay attention to matters of sights, sounds, smells, or tastes, because we
have already understood and let go of them, knowing that they aren&#8217;t the
causal factors. They aren&#8217;t as important as this mind, which is the primary
instigator &#8212; the culprit renowned throughout the circles of the cycle, the
agitator, the disturber of the peace, creating havoc for itself only right here
inside.
<!--l. 64824--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness and discernment probe inward and focus right here. Wherever this
mind goes, it&#8217;s the only thing causing harm. So we watch patiently over
this culprit to see what he will do next &#8212; and aside from being alert to
what he will do, we also have to use discernment to penetrate in and see
who is inciting him. Who stands behind him, so that he must be constantly
committing crimes? He keeps creating deceptive issues without pause &#8212;
why?
<!--l. 64832--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness and discernment dig in there, not simply to pounce on or lay siege to
his behavior, but also to go right into his lair to see what motivating force lies within
it. What is the real instigator? There has to be a cause. If there&#8217;s no cause, no
supporting condition to spin the mind into action, the mind can&#8217;t simply act on its
own.
<!--l. 64838--><p class="indent" >   If it simply acts on its own, then it has to be a matter of khandhas pure and
simple &#8212; but here it&#8217;s not pure and simple. Whatever behavior the mind displays,
whatever issues it forms, all give rise to gladness or sadness. This shows that these
conditions aren&#8217;t &#8217;simply&#8217; coming out. There&#8217;s a cause. There&#8217;s an underlying
condition that sends them out, making them give rise to real pleasure and pain when
we fall for them.
<!--l. 64846--><p class="indent" >   While we are exploring inward at this point, we have already seen that the mind
is the culprit, so we must consider letting go of all external things. Our burdens grow
less and less. There remain only the issues of the mind and the issues of formation
and interpretation that arise solely from the mind. Mindfulness and discernment spin
whizzing around in there and ultimately come to know what it is that causes
the mind to form so many thoughts giving rise to love, anger, and hate. As
soon as it appears, the heart knows it; and when the heart knows it, the
&#8217;Lord of Conventional Reality,&#8217; which is blended with the mind, dissolves
away.
<!--l. 64857--><p class="indent" >   At this point the cycle has been destroyed through mindfulness and discernment.
The mind is no longer guilty, and turns into a mind absolutely pure. Once the
problem of the cycle is ended, there is no way that we can find fault with the mind.
When we could find fault, that was because the fault was still in the mind. It was
hiding in the mind. Just as when criminals or enemies have taken up hiding in a cave:
We have to destroy the cave as well, and can&#8217;t conserve it out of affection for
it.
<!--l. 64866--><p class="indent" >   Avijja &#8212; unawareness &#8212; is the lord of the three levels of existence that has
infiltrated the mind, and thus we have to consider destroying the entire thing. If the
mind isn&#8217;t genuine, it will dissolve together with unawareness. If it&#8217;s genuine in line
with its nature, it will become a pure mind &#8212; something peerless &#8212; because all
things counterfeit have fallen away from it through the use of mindfulness and
discernment.

<!--l. 64874--><p class="indent" >   When the counterfeit things that are like rust latching firmly onto the mind
finally dissolve away through the power of mindfulness and discernment, the mind
becomes genuine Dhamma. You can call it &#8217;the genuine mind&#8217; or &#8217;the genuine
Dhamma&#8217;: There&#8217;s no contradiction, because there is no more reason for
contradiction, which is an affair of defilement. You can say 100% that the flavor of
the Dhamma has surpassed all other flavors. When the mind is pure Dhamma, it has
had enough of all other things. It is absolutely no longer involved with anything else
at all. It&#8217;s one mind, one Dhamma. There is only one. There is only one genuine
Dhamma. The mind is Dhamma, the Dhamma is the mind. That&#8217;s all that can be
said.
<!--l. 64886--><p class="indent" >   I ask each of you to take this and contemplate it. This is the basis for the
truth of the teachings that the Lord Buddha taught from the beginning until
the moment of his total nibbana. The purity of his mind was a deeply felt
Dhamma that he experienced with his full heart. He then proclaimed that
Dhamma, with the benevolence of his full heart, teaching the world up to the
present.
<!--l. 64893--><p class="indent" >   To call his teachings, &#8217;the benevolence of the Lord Buddha&#8217; shouldn&#8217;t be wrong,
because he taught the world with true benevolence. When we take those
teachings and put them into practice in a way that goes straight to the heart,
we will come to see things we have never seen before, never known before,
within this heart, step by step, until we reach the full level of practice, know
the full level of knowledge, and gain release from suffering and stress with
our full hearts, with nothing left latching on. This is called wiping out the
cemeteries &#8212; the birth and death of the body and mind &#8212; for good. What a
relief!
<!--l. 64904--><p class="indent" >   And now that we&#8217;ve reached this point, I don&#8217;t know what more to say, because
I&#8217;m at a loss for words. I ask that you as meditators practice, train yourselves and
explore all Dhammas until you too are at a loss of words like this speaker at his wits&#8217;
end. Even though we may be stupid, infinitely stupid, I&#8217;ll ask to express my
admiration straight from the heart.
<!--l. 64911--><p class="indent" >   Evam.
<!--l. 64913--><p class="indent" >   Feelings of Pain
<!--l. 64915--><p class="indent" >   In the Discourse on Good Omens (Mangala Sutta), the Buddha teaches us to
associate with sages, and not with fools. The first and foremost fool here is our own
heart. In other words, there are fools outside and fools inside, and for the most part
the fools inside are the ones who keep stirring up trouble all the time. When
we live with meditation masters, which is called associating with sages, we
keep gaining lessons from sages, because that&#8217;s what they are. They are
wise in the various tactics they teach us. They have practiced and gained
knowledge of everything from experience. Their teachings are thus correct,
precise, and convincing to those who listen to them, with no room for any
doubt.
<!--l. 64926--><p class="indent" >   In particular, Venerable Acariya Mun: There never was a time when he would
teach saying, &#8217;It seems to be like this. It seems to be like that.&#8217; There was nothing
but, &#8217;This is the way it is for sure, for sure&#8217; &#8212; and we were sure, because he spoke
only the absolute truth taken right from a heart that had already known and seen,

and from his own well-conducted practice. Especially in the case of illness: If there
were any weak-willed cases, he would tell them, &#8217;Whoever is weak, whoever cries and
moans, can take his moans as his medicine. There&#8217;s no need to search out medicine
anywhere, no need to have anyone to look after him. His moans are his medicine.
If moaning serves any purpose, then why search for medicine to treat the
disease?&#8217;
<!--l. 64938--><p class="indent" >   Then he would add, &#8217;Keep moaning. Everyone can moan. Even children can moan
&#8212; if it serves a purpose. But here it doesn&#8217;t serve any purpose at all other than to
annoy those good people who are unflinching in the practice. So you shouldn&#8217;t moan
out of weakness. You&#8217;re a meditation monk. When you act like this, who can bear to
see it? If you were a child or an ordinary person, there wouldn&#8217;t be anything wrong
with it, because they haven&#8217;t received any training. They don&#8217;t have any knowledge
or understanding of the various ways to contend with the pain, such as contemplating
it.
<!--l. 64948--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;But you, you already know everything of every sort. Yet when trouble comes,
such as illness, you can&#8217;t find any methods or tactics to care for yourself. You just go
all to pieces. This won&#8217;t do at all. You&#8217;re a shame to yourself and your fellow
meditators.&#8217;
<!--l. 64953--><p class="indent" >   Venerable Acariya Mun was very talented in teaching the heart. When those of
his disciples who were intent on studying with him would listen to anything he&#8217;d say,
it would go straight to the heart. Straight to the heart. The things we should put into
practice, we would put into practice. The things we should understand right then,
dealing with internal matters, we would understand &#8212; every time, step after
step.
<!--l. 64961--><p class="indent" >   When we were ill, he would teach us how to contemplate. &#8217;When you have a fever,
where did you get it from?&#8217; He&#8217;d say this so as to serve a purpose, as food for thought
for meditators. &#8217;From where did you drag out the fever and chills? They arise in this
body, don&#8217;t they? When they disappear, where do they go, if not back to where they
came from? Even if they don&#8217;t disappear, they die together with each of us:
There are no exceptions at all in this body. Investigate it so as to know
it.
<!--l. 64970--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;All stress, all pains are Noble Truths. If we don&#8217;t investigate them, what are we
going to investigate? The Buddha gained Awakening with the Noble Truths, his
disciples gained Awakening with the Noble Truths &#8212; so are we going to gain
Awakening with weakness? Would that be in keeping with the Dhamma of the
Buddha? Then we&#8217;ve come to resist the Dhamma!
<!--l. 64977--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Where does the pain arise? In which part? Ask so as to find out. When it hurts
here and aches there, who is it that hurts? Who is it that aches? Probe
on in to find what instigates it. Where does it come from? Where does it
hurt? What causes it to hurt? What perceives it as pain? When the body
dies and they cremate it, does it hurt? Who is it that deceives itself into
thinking that this hurts or that aches? Investigate so as to find its initial
causes.
<!--l. 64985--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;If you&#8217;re a meditator who doesn&#8217;t know initial causes and doesn&#8217;t know their
effects &#8212; this heap of suffering &#8212; then how are you going to cure suffering? What is
your discernment for? Why don&#8217;t you think? Why don&#8217;t you find it and put it to

use?
<!--l. 64990--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Your mindfulness and discernment are for keeping things in mind and
investigating them &#8212; things such as feelings of pain that exist in your body and
mind.&#8217;
<!--l. 64994--><p class="indent" >   He would keep stressing his points, step by step. If the person listening was
intent on listening &#8212; and especially if he had any fighting spirit &#8212; he&#8217;d
find it easy to grasp the point, and it would appeal to him immediately.
Immediately.
<!--l. 64999--><p class="indent" >   When we&#8217;d leave Venerable Acariya Mun to live in any spot suitable for the
practice, his teachings would seem to reverberate through the heart. You could
remember every facet of his teachings, every important point that should be used as
a tool in the practice. For example, if you were staying in a challenging place, it was
if he were right there in the heart. The heart would be really audacious and
exultant in practicing, knowing the Dhamma, seeing it, understanding it. You
would understand with audacity, and with a warrior&#8217;s spirit &#8212; not by being
discouraged, irresolute, or beating a retreat. That&#8217;s not the way to make the
defilements fear you and disappear from the heart. That&#8217;s not at all the way to
cure defilement, to know the affairs of defilement or to be able to remove
them.
<!--l. 65012--><p class="indent" >   This is the religion! There is nothing to compare with it in being so correct, so
precise, so genuine, so true, so indisputable. If we all were to follow the principles of
the religion, there would be no need for prisons or jails. What need would they serve?
Nobody would be doing any wrong! People would see in line with reason and
acknowledge their rightness and wrongness, their good and their evil, using the
principles of reason as their standard. We human beings would then be able to live
with one another.
<!--l. 65021--><p class="indent" >   The reason we need laws, prisons, and jails is because we don&#8217;t admit our wrongs.
When we&#8217;re wrong, we don&#8217;t admit that we&#8217;re wrong. Even the moment after we see
ourselves do something wrong, we won&#8217;t admit to it. Even when we&#8217;re put in jail and
are asked, we still say, &#8217;They accused me of stealing this and stealing that&#8217; &#8212; even
though we ourselves actually stole it. This is simply an unwillingness to
admit to things in line with reason, in line with the truth. Even within the
heart, with things that concern us exclusively, the same holds true: We don&#8217;t
admit to them, which is why we receive so much pain and suffering. If we
admit to the principles of the truth, the things that appear in line with the
truth can be resolved through the truth. For example, even when pain arises
in the body, it won&#8217;t disrupt the mind because our knowledge is wise to
it.
<!--l. 65035--><p class="indent" >   As the principles of the Dhamma say, pains have been appearing in our body and
mind ever since we first became aware of things. There is no reason for us to get
excited, frightened, or upset by them to the point where they disease the
mind.
<!--l. 65040--><p class="indent" >   This is why mental development, or meditation, is an excellent science for gaining
knowledge on all fronts: Those who practice consistently are not upset when pain
arises in the body. They can even focus on the spot where the pain arises so as to
investigate and analyze it in line with its truth until gaining skillful and courageous

tactics for dealing with it admirably.
<!--l. 65047--><p class="indent" >   The important point is to associate with sages, wise people, those who are sharp
and astute. If we aren&#8217;t yet able to depend on ourselves, we have to depend
on our teachers to instruct us. If we listen often, their teachings gradually
seep into us and blend with our temperament until our mind becomes a
mind with Dhamma. Our mind becomes a sage, a wise person, and can
eventually take care of itself, becoming &#8217;atta hi attano natho&#8217; &#8212; its own
mainstay.
<!--l. 65055--><p class="indent" >   So in every activity where we aren&#8217;t yet capable, we first have to depend
on others. In living with those who are good, we are bound to find peace
and happiness. Our traits come to mesh with theirs &#8212; this is important
&#8212; until our own traits become good and admirable as well. It&#8217;s the same
as if we were to associate with bad people: At first we aren&#8217;t bad, but as
we associate with them for a long time, our traits blend themselves with
theirs until we become bad without being aware of it. When we are fully
bad, this makes us even more blind. We feel that we&#8217;ve become even better.
No one else can push us around. Otherwise our &#8217;goodness&#8217; will jump into
action &#8212; the &#8217;goodness&#8217; of a bad person, an evil that wise people everywhere
fear.
<!--l. 65068--><p class="indent" >   Bad people and good people. Evil and good. These things get turned
around in this way. Bad people thus can&#8217;t see the truth that they are bad,
and so flatter themselves into thinking, &#8217;I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m smart. I&#8217;m clever.
I&#8217;m one of the most renowned operators around.&#8217; That&#8217;s how they twist
things!
<!--l. 65074--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, associating with meditation masters, with sages, is important for
anyone who is striving to become a good person, who is hoping to prosper and be
happy, because sages will teach us often. Their manners and deportment that we see
day after day will gradually seep into and nurture our minds. We can hold to them
continually as good examples, for everything they do in every way is all
Dhamma.
<!--l. 65081--><p class="indent" >   Especially if they&#8217;re people devoid of defilement, then there is nothing to compare
with them. Like Venerable Acariya Mun: I&#8217;m certain that he was devoid
of defilement. After hearing the Dhamma from him, I had no doubts. He
himself never said that he was devoid of defilement, you know. He never said
that he was an arahant or anything, but he would say it in his ability to
explain the true Dhamma on every level in a way that would go straight to
the heart and erase all doubt for all those who came to study with him.
This is why I can dare to say unabashedly that Venerable Acariya Mun
Bhuridatta Thera is one of the important arahants of our day and age &#8212; an age
in which arahants are exceedingly rare, because it&#8217;s an age sadly lacking
in people practicing the Dhamma for the sake of arahantship. Instead, we
practice to eliminate arahantship by amassing all kinds of miscellaneous
defilements. This holds for all of us, so no one is in a position to criticize anyone
else.
<!--l. 65097--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s return to the subject of feelings: To investigate feelings of pain is very
important. This is something I learned from Venerable Acariya Mun. He took this

very seriously whenever any of the meditators in his monastery became
ill. Sometimes he would go himself and ask, &#8217;How are you contemplating
your illness?&#8217; Then he&#8217;d really emphasize the Dhamma. &#8217;Go probing right
there. Wherever there&#8217;s pain, investigate so as to see the truth of the pain.&#8217;
He&#8217;d teach how to investigate: &#8217;Don&#8217;t retreat. To retreat is to enhance the
pain.
<!--l. 65106--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;To be a warrior, you have fight using discernment. This is what will bring
victory: the ability to keep up with the feeling of pain that you hold to be an
important enemy. Actually, that feeling isn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s enemy. It doesn&#8217;t have any
sense of consciousness at all. It&#8217;s simply a truth &#8212; that&#8217;s all. So investigate on in.
You don&#8217;t have to anticipate it or concern yourself with whether it&#8217;s a big pain
or a small pain. All that&#8217;s asked is that you know its truth with your own
discernment, so that the heart won&#8217;t deceive you.&#8217; That&#8217;s what he would
say.
<!--l. 65116--><p class="indent" >   Actually, our heart is deceit incarnate, because that which deceives is within the
heart and fools the heart into making assumptions and interpretations. Stupidity has
an easy time believing lies. Clever people have an easy time deceiving stupid people.
Deceit has an easy time fooling stupidity. The cleverness of the defilements gets along
well with our own stupidity. This is why the Dhamma teaches us to ferret
things out to investigate down to their truth and then to believe in line with
that truth. This is our means of gaining victory step by step. Ferret out
the pains that are always with you so as to see them. Don&#8217;t run away from
them. Whether they&#8217;re big or small, investigate right there. Investigate right
there. If you&#8217;re going to concentrate, concentrate right there. When you
are investigating its causes, no matter how great the pain, keep probing
in.
<!--l. 65130--><p class="indent" >   The thing we call pain: What does it depend on as its foundation? It depends on
the body as its foundation. It depends on our attention as its means of flaring up &#8212;
in other words, the attention that labels it in various ways: This is what makes pain
flare up. We have to cure this kind of attention by investigating to know both
the pain &#8212; what it&#8217;s like &#8212; and the place where pain arises, in whatever
part of the body. Try to know clearly whether or not that spot is really
pain.
<!--l. 65139--><p class="indent" >   For example, if there&#8217;s pain in the bone, in any part of the skin or flesh, the skin
and the flesh are skin and flesh. The pain is a pain. Even though they dwell together,
they are separate things, not one and the same. The mind &#8212; the knower that is
aware of these things &#8212; is a mind, but it&#8217;s a deluded mind, so it assumes that this is
pain, that&#8217;s pain, and conflates these things into being its &#8217;self,&#8217; saying, &#8217;I hurt here. I
hurt there. I don&#8217;t want myself to be pained. I want the pain to vanish.&#8217; This desire is
a defilement that encourages pain and suffering to arise. The heart is pained. The
feeling of pain in the body is pain. The pain in the heart flares up with
that pain, because it wants it to follow the heart&#8217;s desires. These things
keep feeding each other. This is our own stupidity, loading us down with
suffering.
<!--l. 65153--><p class="indent" >   To be intelligent, we have to investigate, to watch the feeling of pain in the heart.
What does it come from? What does it depend on? It depends on the body. Which

part of the body? From what spot in the body does the pain arise? Look at
the body and the feeling: Are they one and the same thing? What kind of
shape and features do they have? The feeling doesn&#8217;t have any shape or
features or a posture of any kind. It simply appears as a feeling of pain, that&#8217;s
all.
<!--l. 65161--><p class="indent" >   As for the body, it has a shape, a color, and complexion &#8212; and it stays as it was
before the pain arose. When the pain arises, it stays just as it was. Actually, the pain
is something separate from this. It simply depends on a malfunction of the body to
arise. The mind is what takes notice of it. If the mind has any discernment, it should
notice it in line with its truth. The mind then won&#8217;t be affected by it. But if the mind
is deluded, it latches onto the pain &#8212; in other words, it pulls that pain
in to be its &#8217;self&#8217; &#8212; and then wants that pain, which it says is its self, to
disappear.
<!--l. 65172--><p class="indent" >   This is why we can&#8217;t analyze it. Once the pain is our self, how can we separate it
out? If it&#8217;s simply a pain, a separate reality, then the body is a separate reality. They
aren&#8217;t one and the same. Each one exists separately. Each is a separate reality in
line with its nature. Only when our awareness is like this can we analyze
things.
<!--l. 65178--><p class="indent" >   But as long as we see the pain as our self, then we can analyze it all day long and
not get anywhere, because once we hold that, &#8217;This is myself,&#8217; how can we analyze it?
We haven&#8217;t separated these things with discernment, so we have to keep holding onto
them as our self. When the khandhas and the mind blend into one, we can&#8217;t analyze
them. But when we try to use mindfulness and discernment to investigate in to see
the truth of these things &#8212; that each exists separately, each has its separate
reality, which holds true for us and for everyone else &#8212; and this realization
goes deep into the heart, then the pain gradually fades away, fades away. At
the same time, we know what makes the connection from the pain into the
heart, because the connection comes from the heart. When we investigate
the pain, it comes retracting into the heart. All the affairs of pain come
from the heart that labels or that experiences mental pain because of an
insidious connection by way of attachment (upadana) that we don&#8217;t yet
know.
<!--l. 65195--><p class="indent" >   When we investigate so as to see clearly, we follow the feeling of pain inward. We
come in knowing, knowing. The pain keeps retracting and retracting, into the heart.
Once we know that the heart is what created the attachment, making itself construe
the pain to be itself, creating a great deal of suffering-once we know this, the pain
disappears.
<!--l. 65201--><p class="indent" >   Or &#8212; alternatively &#8212; once we know this, the pain stays real, but the heart
doesn&#8217;t latch onto it. Even though the pain may not disappear, the mind is the mind.
It doesn&#8217;t make any connection through attachment. Each is its own separate reality.
This is called the mind being its own self &#8212; cool, calm, and collected &#8212; in the midst
of the pain of the khandhas. This is to know that the mind is a reality just as each
khandha is a separate reality.
<!--l. 65210--><p class="indent" >   This is the path for those who are practicing so as to become wise to the five
khandhas, with feelings of pain as their primary focus.
<!--l. 65213--><p class="indent" >   But for those who understand all the way, to the point of reaching &#8217;the

unshakable mind, the unshakable Dhamma&#8217; (akuppa-citta, akuppa-dhamma) that
can&#8217;t be provoked into being anything else, there is no problem at all. Whether pain
is little or great, they have absolutely no problem because their minds are
always true. There is never a time when their minds, which are already
pure, can become defiled, can become &#8217;worlded.&#8217; There&#8217;s no way it could
happen. For this reason, whatever conditions the khandhas may display,
such people know them in line with the principles of nature. The khandhas
themselves appear in line with the principles of nature and disappear in
line with nature. They remain naturally and then disappear naturally. The
mind knows in line with its own nature, without having to be forced or
coerced in any way. The minds of those who know totally all-around are like
this.
<!--l. 65227--><p class="indent" >   As for those of us who are investigating the khandhas to know them and
withdraw from them step by step, even though our minds are not yet like that
while we are practicing, even though our hopes aren&#8217;t yet fulfilled, still our
investigation of pain is for the purpose of separating the mind from the pain so
that it&#8217;s not entangled in pain, so that whenever pain arises in greater or
lesser measure, the mind doesn&#8217;t cling to the pain as being itself. We do this
so as not to gather up the pain as being our self &#8212; which would be the
same as taking fire to burn ourself. When we can do this, we can be at our
ease.
<!--l. 65238--><p class="indent" >   So pain is an excellent whetstone for discernment. However much pain arises, set
your mindfulness and discernment focused right there. Turn to look at the mind, and
then expand your awareness to encompass the feeling and the body, each of which is
already a separate part. The body is one part, the feeling is another, and
the mind another. Keep going back and forth among them, investigating
with discernment until you understand &#8212; and it really goes to the heart &#8212;
that, &#8217;Each khandha is simply... and that&#8217;s all.&#8217; None of them appears to be
any such thing as &#8217;you&#8217; or &#8217;yours.&#8217; They are simply different realities that
appear, and that&#8217;s all. When you understand clearly like this, the heart
becomes its own free and independent self at that moment and it knows
that the mind and the khandhas are separate realities, neither affecting the
other.
<!--l. 65252--><p class="indent" >   Even at the moment when you are about to die, the heart will be up on events in
the immediate present. It won&#8217;t be shaken by pain and death because it is sure that
the mind is the mind: a stronghold of awareness. Each khandha is simply a condition.
The mind thus doesn&#8217;t fear death because it is sure of itself that it won&#8217;t get
destroyed anywhere.
<!--l. 65259--><p class="indent" >   Even though it may not have yet reached the level where it&#8217;s absolutely devoid of
defilement, the mind has still prepared itself using discernment with the khandhas so
that it&#8217;s supreme. In other words, it lives with the Noble Truths. It lives with its
whetstone for discernment. Discernment will spread its power far and wide. The
heart will grow more and more radiant, more and more courageous, because
discernment is what cleanses it. Even if death comes at that moment, there&#8217;s no
problem.
<!--l. 65267--><p class="indent" >   For one thing, if you use mindfulness and discernment to investigate pain without

retreating, to the point where you understand it, then even when you really are
about to die, you&#8217;ll know that the pain will disappear first. The mind won&#8217;t
disappear. It will revert into itself, knowing exclusively within itself, and then pass on
at that moment. The phrase, &#8217;Mindfulness lapses,&#8217; doesn&#8217;t exist for a person who has
practiced the Dhamma to this level. We can thus be sure that a person with
mindfulness, even though he or she may not be devoid of defilement, will still be
clearly aware at the moment when pain arises in full force to the point where the
khandhas can no longer endure and will break apart &#8212; will die. The mind will
withdraw itself from all that and revert to its &#8217;mindness&#8217; &#8212; to being its own
independent self &#8212; and then pass on. This is a very high, very refined level of
Dhamma!
<!--l. 65282--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, meditators who are resolute and unflinching for the sake of
knowing every level of the Dhamma tend to be earnest in investigating pain.
When the time comes for them to know, the knowledge goes straight to the
heart. They regard their pain as a Noble Truth in line with the Buddha&#8217;s
teaching that all living beings are fellows in pain, birth, aging, illness, and
death.
<!--l. 65289--><p class="indent" >   So when investigating the khandhas so as to know them in line with their truth,
you shouldn&#8217;t try to thwart or resist the truth. For example, if the body can&#8217;t endure,
let it go. You shouldn&#8217;t cherish it. As for the pain, it will go on its own. This is called
sugato &#8212; faring well.
<!--l. 65295--><p class="indent" >   This is the way of investigating the mind and training the heart that gives clear
results to those who meditate. They have meditated in the way I&#8217;ve described
so that when the time of death is really upon them, they don&#8217;t hope to
depend on anyone at all &#8212; parents, brothers, sisters, relatives, friends, anyone.
They have to withdraw the mind from all things that entangle and involve it
so as to enter that crucial spot where they are engaged in hand-to-hand
combat.
<!--l. 65303--><p class="indent" >   At a time such as this, at the moment when you are about to die, take pain as the
focal point for investigation. Don&#8217;t be willing to retreat &#8212; come what may! All that&#8217;s
asked is that you know and understand this point. Don&#8217;t go thinking that if
you die while being embroiled in investigating pain like this &#8212; while the
mind is in the midst of this commotion &#8212; you&#8217;ll go to a bad bourn. Why
should you go to a bad bourn? You&#8217;re embroiled, but with a noble task.
You&#8217;re embroiled with knowledge, or for the sake of knowledge, and not
because of delusion. The mind is focused on investigating and probing pain.
When the time comes for it really to go, this knowing mind &#8212; the mind
with mindfulness knows &#8212; will withdraw instantly into itself. It will let
go immediately of the work at hand and withdraw into itself, to be itself
&#8212; the mind and nothing but &#8212; and then pass on like a &#8217;sugato&#8217; with the
full capability of a meditator, even though we may not yet be devoid of
defilement.
<!--l. 65320--><p class="indent" >   This is called having full strength to our full capacity, in line with our level of
mind and Dhamma. Investigation and mental development are thus important
matters, matters on which our life and death depend. We needn&#8217;t hope to depend on
anyone else at all &#8212; of this we are certain within ourselves. The heart knows within

itself how strong mindfulness and discernment are, and needn&#8217;t go asking anyone
else.
<!--l. 65328--><p class="indent" >   If the heart is able to investigate to the point where it can pass on at that
moment, all doubts vanish. There are no problems at all. If you think that because
you&#8217;re a woman or because you&#8217;re a layperson, you can&#8217;t realize nibbana,
that&#8217;s your own misconception, which is one kind of defilement deceiving
you.
<!--l. 65334--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma is a truth and everyone&#8217;s common property. Whether we are men or
women, lay or ordained, we can all have mindfulness and discernment. We can all
cure our defilements. When we are willing, any man or woman, any monk or
layperson can use any of the methods to cure defilement and gain release. We needn&#8217;t
create problems to plague our hearts and waste our time. &#8217;Since when do I have the
potential to do that?&#8217; Don&#8217;t think that! You&#8217;re developing the merit and
potential right now! However much or little, you can see it right here in the
mind.
<!--l. 65343--><p class="indent" >   We should examine ourselves. Wherever we are stupid, we should develop
intelligence: mindfulness and discernment. Only then will we be doing what is
genuinely right in terms of the principles of the Lord Buddha&#8217;s Dhamma.
<!--l. 65348--><p class="indent" >   If we criticize ourselves, thinking, &#8217;That person is on this level or that level while
we don&#8217;t have any level at all; wherever we go, this person gets ahead of us, that
person gets ahead of us,&#8217; actually nobody is getting ahead of us except for the
defilements that get ahead of us and deceive us into feeling inferior and depressed,
into thinking that we have only a little potential. That&#8217;s simply a misconception
aimed at making us discouraged and self-pitying, because defilement is looking for a
way to kill us without our realizing it.
<!--l. 65357--><p class="indent" >   We shouldn&#8217;t think in those ways. We are full of potential &#8212; all of us. And why
shouldn&#8217;t we be? We&#8217;re meditators. We&#8217;re all devoted to making merit. Potential isn&#8217;t
something we can set out on the market to compete with one another. Every person
has potential within him or herself. We&#8217;re taught not to belittle one another&#8217;s
potential. Even with animals, we&#8217;re taught not to belittle them &#8212; think
of that! &#8212; because potential lies in the heart of every person and every
animal.
<!--l. 65366--><p class="indent" >   So when curing defilement, you needn&#8217;t waste time thinking those things. They&#8217;ll
simply ruin your morale and your resolve. To think, &#8217;I&#8217;m a worthless woman... a
worthless man... a worthless monk... a worthless layperson. I don&#8217;t have any paths or
fruitions at all. Other people have them, but I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m ashamed to show them my
face&#8217; &#8212; these are wrong thoughts that will spoil your resolve in developing the
various forms of goodness.
<!--l. 65374--><p class="indent" >   The right way to think is this: &#8217;Right now I&#8217;m making an effort, with mindfulness
and discernment, to cure defilement and to develop what is good and meritorious
step by step, which is the direct way to develop my perfections (parami). I have the
potential. I was born in the midst of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings and have developed
the potential and the perfections to my full capacity all along up to the
present.&#8217;
<!--l. 65381--><p class="indent" >   Women can have mindfulness and discernment just like men, because women and
men both have defilements, and defilements are cured with mindfulness and

discernment &#8212; backed by persistent effort &#8212; both by men and by women.
And where do they have defilements? They both have defilements in the
heart. When mindfulness and discernment are complete, women and men
can both pass over and beyond &#8212; with no question of their having to be
ordained.
<!--l. 65389--><p class="indent" >   This is the truth of the Noble Truths, which are not particular about status,
nationality, or any of the human races, and which are not particular about the male
or the female sex. All that&#8217;s asked is that we strive, because the Dhamma is common
to us all. Women and men, lay and ordained, we can all listen to it, understand it,
practice it, and cure defilement.
<!--l. 65396--><p class="indent" >   The defilements don&#8217;t favor men or women. We all have defilements. Even monks
have defilements: What do you say to that? Monks thus have to cure their own
defilements. If they don&#8217;t, they lie buried in defilement just like people in
general who aren&#8217;t interested in the Dhamma &#8212; or even worse than people in
general.
<!--l. 65402--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma thus doesn&#8217;t stipulate that it&#8217;s only for those who are
ordained. What is stipulated is that we cure defilement with persistent effort.
This is something very important. We have to be very interested in this
point.
<!--l. 65407--><p class="indent" >   As for release from suffering and stress, where do we gain release? We gain it right
here, right where there is suffering. If we can cure defilement, we gain release from
suffering. If we can&#8217;t, then no matter what our sex or status, we all have to
suffer.
<!--l. 65412--><p class="indent" >   Here. This is where the religion lies, here in the heart. It doesn&#8217;t lie anywhere else.
If we want to be incapable of it, we can be incapable &#8212; right here in our heart.
Whether lay or ordained, we can be incapable &#8212; if we make ourselves incapable. Or
we can make the religion flourish in our heart &#8212; that we can also do. When the
religion flourishes, where does it flourish? In the heart, and nowhere else. The
important point is the heart. The important point is our practice: the actions, the
manners we display. When the heart develops, the various aspects of our behavior
develop beautifully. Admirably. In particular, the heart flourishes within itself. It has
mindfulness and discernment looking after it constantly. This is called a flourishing
heart. The defilements can hardly ever come to damage it: That&#8217;s when the religion
flourishes.
<!--l. 65426--><p class="indent" >   We should make an effort to examine and straighten things out step by
step. The defilements, you know, are no wider or greater than the limits of
our ability to cure and remove them. They&#8217;re only here in the heart, so
investigate right here. Whether we&#8217;re men or women, lay or ordained, we
all have defilements in our hearts. No matter how thick they may be, if
we consider them we can know them. They&#8217;re like darkness: Even though
darkness may have existed for aeons, all we have to do is turn on a light,
and the darkness disappears completely. The darkness doesn&#8217;t have any
way to brag, saying, &#8217;I&#8217;ve been dark for aeons, so there&#8217;s no way that this
puny light can chase my darkness away.&#8217; When the causes are ready, the
darkness has to disappear completely, and brightness appears in its place.
Even though the darkness may have existed for aeons, it all vanishes in that

instant.
<!--l. 65440--><p class="indent" >   Even though the defilements may be thick and may have been lording it over our
heart for a long time, we should investigate them thoroughly with mindfulness and
discernment. When mindfulness and discernment are capable, they immediately
become all-around. The defilements, even though they may have been in the heart for
aeons, will immediately disintegrate, in the same way that the darkness
that had existed vanishes as soon as a light is lit. Brightness arises instead,
through the power of mindfulness and discernment. Within the heart it is
dazzlingly bright at that moment with &#8217;dhammo padipo&#8217; &#8212; the light of the
Dhamma.
<!--l. 65451--><p class="indent" >   This is all there is. This is the important point we have to investigate. Be sure
to see it. The religion is marvelous &#8212; where is it marvelous? The religion
flourishes &#8212; where does it flourish? The Buddha says to gain release from
stress &#8212; where is it gained? It exists only here in the heart. To analyze
it, there are the four Noble Truths: stress, its origin, its cessation, and the
path.
<!--l. 65459--><p class="indent" >   1. Stress (dukkha): We know it&#8217;s stress because we aren&#8217;t dead.
<!--l. 65461--><p class="indent" >   2. The origin of stress (samudaya): This is what fosters or produces stress. What
forms does it take? We&#8217;re taught, &#8217;Craving... embued with passion and delight,
relishing now here and now there; i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for being,
craving for not-being.&#8217; This we know. Whatever the mind may love or crave, we
should try to straighten it out. It loves and craves the five khandhas, and especially
the five khandhas that it says are &#8217;me.&#8217; So try to become wise to these things, step by
step.
<!--l. 65470--><p class="indent" >   And then there&#8217;s more love and craving: love and craving for the mind,
attachment to the mind, cherishing the mind. So straighten out the mind. Wherever
it feels love, that&#8217;s where defilement is. Keep going in, straightening things out, until
you&#8217;ve reached the truth. Then the heart will have no love or hate, because they are
all gone. The defilements are all gone. The mind has no love, no hate, no
anger. It&#8217;s a pure principle of nature within itself. This is the nature we truly
want.
<!--l. 65479--><p class="indent" >   3. Investigating for the sake of Dhamma: This is the path (magga), with
mindfulness and discernment its important factors.
<!--l. 65482--><p class="indent" >   4. The cessation of stress (nirodha): Stress stops, step by step, until the path is
fully capable and nirodha stops all stress in the heart without leaving a trace.
When nirodha has finished stopping stress, that which knows that stress has
stopped and defilement has stopped... that which knows is &#8217;the pure one.&#8217;
This pure one lies beyond the Noble Truths as a marvelous, extraordinary
Dhamma.
<!--l. 65489--><p class="indent" >   The Noble Truths are activities, conditions, conventions. Even nirodha is a
convention. It&#8217;s the activity of stopping stress. It&#8217;s a conventional reality. When stress
is completely stopped, nothing remains. All that remains is an entirely pure
awareness. This is not a Noble Truth. It&#8217;s the purity of the mind. If you want, you
can call it nibbana. There&#8217;s nothing against calling it whatever you want. When we
reach this level, there are no conflicts &#8212; no conflicts, no disagreements with anyone
at all. We don&#8217;t conflict with ourselves; we don&#8217;t conflict with anything. Our

knowledge is wise to everything, so we can say what we like. There are no
problems at all. All I ask is that you know this marvelous, extraordinary
Dhamma. Its excellence exists of its own accord, without our having to confer
titles.
<!--l. 65502--><p class="indent" >   This, then, is the genuine religion. Probe right here. Probe on in. When in the
practice of the religion we come to know, we&#8217;ll know right here. If the religion is to
flourish, it will flourish right here. The Buddha, in teaching the beings of the world to
gain release from suffering, taught right here &#8212; and release is gained right here,
nowhere else. We qualify as beings of the world and lie within the net of the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings. We&#8217;re in the Buddha&#8217;s following. Each of us has the right to
practice and remove defilement so as to go beyond suffering and stress. All of us in
the four groups of the Buddha&#8217;s following (parisa) have the right to realize ourselves
and reach nibbana.
<!--l. 65514--><p class="indent" >   So. I ask that you contemplate. Investigate. Be brave in fighting the things that
should be fought within the heart. Develop courage. Develop mindfulness and
discernment until they are sufficient. Search for various tactics for probing: These we
should develop within ourselves. To probe on our own is the right way. It&#8217;s our own
wealth. Teachers lend us bits and pieces, which are merely fragments to serve as hints
or as leads for us to contemplate so that they&#8217;ll grow and branch out into our own
wealth.
<!--l. 65523--><p class="indent" >   Any Dhamma that&#8217;s a wealth coming from our own tactics: That&#8217;s truly our
own wealth. We&#8217;ll never exhaust it. If we can think and probe cunningly in
removing defilements until they fall away completely, using the tactics we
develop on our own from the ideas our teachers lend us as starting capital,
that&#8217;s our own Dhamma. However much may arise, it&#8217;s all our own Dhamma.
What we derive from the texts is the Buddha&#8217;s &#8212; and we borrow it from
him. What we get from our teachers, we borrow from them &#8212; except when
we are listening to them teach and we understand the Dhamma and cure
defilement at that moment: That&#8217;s our wealth while we are listening. After
that, we take their tactics to contemplate until they branch out through our
own ingenuity. This is our own wealth, in terms both of the causes &#8212; our
contemplation &#8212; and of the outcome, the satisfactory results we gain step by
step all the way to release from suffering and stress &#8212; and that&#8217;s entirely
ours. It stays with us, and no one can come to divide up any of our share at
all.
<!--l. 65541--><p class="indent" >   This is where the excellence becomes excellent. It doesn&#8217;t become excellent
anywhere else. So try to find the excellence, the peerlessness that lies within you, by
striving and being energetic. Other than this awareness, there&#8217;s no excellence at
all.
<!--l. 65546--><p class="indent" >   But at present the heart is concealed by things that are filthy and worthless, and
so it too has become something that lacks its proper worth. Right now we are
washing it, peeling away the various kinds of defilement, step by step. When we
have used our full strength to peel them all away until there aren&#8217;t any
left in the heart, then the heart is fully pure. Excellence appears here in
this heart &#8212; and so the excellence is excellent right here. We don&#8217;t have to
search anywhere for anything more, for we have fully reached the &#8217;land of

enough.&#8217;
<!--l. 65556--><p class="indent" >   So then. I&#8217;ll ask to stop here.
<!--l. 65558--><p class="indent" >   Investigating Pain
<!--l. 65560--><p class="indent" >   We human beings are like trees: If we water a tree, fertilize it, and keep looking
after it, it will be fresher and grow faster than it normally would if we let it fend for
itself without our help. The mind, when we keep looking after it, will become more
and more radiant and peaceful, step by step. If it isn&#8217;t trained, it&#8217;s like a tree that
isn&#8217;t looked after. Whenever it lacks training, it begins to act tarnished and
defiled because the things that tarnish and defile it are already there inside
it.
<!--l. 65569--><p class="indent" >   When we look after the mind continually with meditation, it will gradually
become more and more calm. When it&#8217;s calm, it will begin to develop radiance along
with its calm. And once it&#8217;s calm, then when we contemplate anything, we can
penetrate into the workings of cause and effect so as to understand in line with the
truths that appear both within us and without. But if the mind is clouded and
confused, its thoughts are all worthless. Right becomes wrong, and wrong becomes
progressively even more wrong.
<!--l. 65578--><p class="indent" >   Thus we are taught to train the mind so that it will be quiet, calm, and radiant,
able to see its shadows, just as when water is limpid and clear: We look down into the
water and can see clearly whatever plants or animals there are. But if the water is
muddy, we can&#8217;t see anything when we look down into it. No matter what&#8217;s
there in the water &#8212; plants, animals, or whatever &#8212; we can&#8217;t see them at
all.
<!--l. 65586--><p class="indent" >   The same holds true with the mind. If it&#8217;s clouded, then we can&#8217;t see the harm of
whatever &#8212; big or small &#8212; is hidden within it, even though that harm has been bad
for the mind all along. This is because the mind isn&#8217;t radiant. For this reason, a mind
clouded with muddy preoccupations can&#8217;t investigate to the point of seeing anything,
which is why we have to train the mind to make it radiant, and then it will see its
shadows.
<!--l. 65594--><p class="indent" >   These shadows lie buried in the mind. In other words, they&#8217;re the various
conditions that come out of the mind. They&#8217;re called shadows &#8212; and we&#8217;re forever
deluded into being attached to these shadows that come from the thoughts
constantly forming and coming out of the mind at all times. They catch us off
guard, so that we think &#8217;this&#8217; is us, &#8217;that&#8217; is us, anything at all is us, even
though they are simply shadows and not the real thing. Our belief or delusion,
though, turns them into the &#8217;real thing.&#8217; As a result, we end up troubled and
anxious.
<!--l. 65604--><p class="indent" >   At present, the great respected meditation masters on whom we depend in the
area of the practice and in the area of the mind are falling away one by one.
Those who are left can barely take care of themselves. Physically, they are
wearing out step by step &#8212; like Venerable Acariya Khao. To see him is really
heart-rending. When the body reaches its final extremity, it&#8217;s as if it had never
been strong or in radiant health. To lie down is painful, to sit is painful &#8212;
whatever the position, it&#8217;s painful. When the time comes for pain to come
thronging in, the khandhas are nothing but pain. But for people like this, it&#8217;s
simply a matter of the body and the khandhas. In the area of the mind, they

have no more problems about the behavior of the body or the khandhas at
all.
<!--l. 65617--><p class="indent" >   But as for us, well, we&#8217;re always there welcoming such problems. No
matter whether it&#8217;s the body or the thoughts of the mind that are acting
adversely, the mind begins to act adversely as well. For example, if the body is
malfunctioning, the mind begins to malfunction too, even though there is nothing
really wrong with it. This is due to the mind&#8217;s own fear, caused by the fact
that mindfulness and discernment aren&#8217;t up on the events surrounding the
mind.
<!--l. 65625--><p class="indent" >   This is why we&#8217;re taught to train our mindfulness and discernment to be capable
and bold, alert to events arising within the mind and around it &#8212; namely, in the
various aspects of the khandhas when they behave in adverse ways. We have to be
alert to these things. All that&#8217;s needed is for the mind not to be alert, or for it to be
deluded by these things, and it will create stress and pain for itself without
ceasing. Pain will have to come pouring in to overwhelm it. Even though the
body may be pained simply in accordance with its own affairs, in accordance
with the principles of nature, the mind will still grab hold of it to cause
pain for itself, to burn itself, if it hasn&#8217;t investigated to see through these
things.
<!--l. 65637--><p class="indent" >   If the mind has mindfulness constantly governing and guarding it, then whatever
damage arises will be minor, because it arises in a single spot &#8212; within the mind
&#8212; and mindfulness is there at the same spot, alert to the fact that this is
arising, that is arising, good or evil is arising within. Discernment is what
unravels, contemplates, investigates, and remedies the different preoccupations
arising in the mind. Things then begin to calm down. But if mindfulness is
lacking, things begin to get drawn out. Even though thought-formations may
arise and vanish, one after another, countless times, sañña &#8212; labels and
interpretations &#8212; don&#8217;t vanish. They connect things into long stretches. Stress
and pain will then have to connect into long stretches and gather into the
heart.
<!--l. 65650--><p class="indent" >   The heart is what then reaps all this suffering by itself because of the acts
(kamma) that sañña and sankhara fashion. The heart is the primary vessel for
receiving both pleasure and pain &#8212; and for the most part it receives pain. If it lacks
mindfulness and discernment, it receives only fakes and scraps. Rubbish. Things toxic
and dangerous. But if it&#8217;s mindful and discerning, it can pick and choose. Whatever
isn&#8217;t good, it picks out and throws away, leaving only the things of substance and
worth within the heart. The heart is cooled, but not with water. It feels pleasure, but
not because of external things. It&#8217;s cool from the Dhamma. It feels pleasure in the
Dhamma &#8212; and the reason is because mindfulness and discernment are looking after
it.
<!--l. 65663--><p class="indent" >   To attend to other things is not as difficult as attending to the heart. All the
burdens of the world converge at the heart, and so to remove the things that have
long been buried within us is very difficult work. We may even become discouraged
because we see almost no results when we first begin. This is because the mind is still
drifting while we work. It doesn&#8217;t really focus on taking its work seriously, and so
results don&#8217;t appear as they should. This makes us discouraged, weak, and dejected.

We give up, thinking, &#8217;It&#8217;d be better to stop, because we&#8217;re not getting anywhere&#8217; &#8212;
even though once we have stopped it&#8217;s not any better, except that the mind has a
better chance of filling itself with evil after we&#8217;ve stopped striving toward the
good.
<!--l. 65676--><p class="indent" >   The assumption that says &#8217;better&#8217; is the work of the defilements, which are all
deceivers, tricking us into being discouraged and weak. Actually, even while we are
striving, things aren&#8217;t yet getting good, even though we are practically dying to make
them good. Our heart is ready to burst because of the effort &#8212; so how can things
become good once we stop? If, as we think, things were to get good once we stop,
then no one should have to do work of any sort any more. Once we stop,
everything of every sort would become good on its own! Both within and without,
things would have to be good. We won&#8217;t have to do much work. It&#8217;s better to
stop.
<!--l. 65687--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma isn&#8217;t like the defilements. The defilements say, &#8217;It&#8217;s better to stop.&#8217;
It&#8217;s better, all right &#8212; better for the sake of defilement, not for the sake
of the Dhamma. The Dhamma is something with which we have to keep
persevering until it&#8217;s good, and then better, and then even better, continually,
because we don&#8217;t stop. This work is our work, which we do for the sake
of Dhamma. It&#8217;s not lazy work, which is the work of the defilements. The
results of the work will then appear step by step because we do it without
ceasing.
<!--l. 65696--><p class="indent" >   This is how it is with the work of meditation. When it&#8217;s easy, we do it;
when it&#8217;s hard, we do it &#8212; because it&#8217;s work that ought to be done. If we
don&#8217;t do it, who will do it for us? When the fires of pain and suffering are
consuming the heart because of the thoughts we form and accumulate, why
don&#8217;t we complain that it&#8217;s hard? When we accumulate defilement to cause
stress and anxiety to the heart, why don&#8217;t we feel that it&#8217;s difficult? Why
don&#8217;t we complain about the stress? Because we&#8217;re content to do it. We&#8217;re
not bothered with whether it&#8217;s easy or hard. It simply flows &#8212; like water
flowing downhill. Whether it&#8217;s hard or not, it simply flows on its own, so that
we don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s hard or not. But when we force ourselves to
do good, it&#8217;s like rolling a log uphill. It&#8217;s hard because it goes against the
grain.
<!--l. 65710--><p class="indent" >   In relinquishing the sufferings, big and small, to which the mind submits in the
course of the cycle of rebirth, some of the work just naturally has to be difficult.
Everyone &#8212; even those who have attained the paths, the fruitions, and
nibbana easily &#8212; has found it hard at first. When we reach the stage where it
should be easy, it&#8217;ll have to be easy. When we reach the stage we call hard,
it&#8217;ll have to be hard, but it won&#8217;t always be hard like this. When the time
comes for it to be light or easy, it&#8217;s easy. And especially when we&#8217;ve come
to see results appearing step by step, the difficulty disappears on its own,
because we&#8217;re completely ready for it, with no concern for pleasure or pain. We
simply want to know, to see, to understand the things on which our sights are
set.
<!--l. 65723--><p class="indent" >   Study. We should study the elements and khandhas. We should keep watch on the
elements and khandhas coming into contact with us. This is an important principle

for all meditators. We should keep watch on them all the time because they keep
changing all the time. They&#8217;re &#8217;aniccam&#8217; all the time, &#8217;dukkham&#8217; all the time, without
respite, without stop.
<!--l. 65730--><p class="indent" >   Investigate. We should keep trying to see their affairs as they occur within us,
until we&#8217;re adept at it. As we keep investigating again and again, the mind will
gradually come to understand more and more profoundly, straight to the heart. The
heart will gradually let go, of its own accord. It&#8217;s not the case that we investigate
once and then stop, waiting to rake in the results even though the causes aren&#8217;t
sufficient. That&#8217;s not how it works.
<!--l. 65738--><p class="indent" >   All forms of striving for the good &#8212; such as meditating &#8212; have to go against the
grain of the defilements. All of the great meditation masters, before becoming
famous and revered by the world, survived death through great efforts. If
this were easy work, how could we say they survived death? It had to be
heavy work that required that they exert themselves to the utmost. Most
of these masters have since passed away. Only a few are left. We hope to
depend on them, but their bodies are &#8217;aniccam.&#8217; We can depend on them only
for a period, only for a time, and then we are parted, as we have seen at
present.
<!--l. 65749--><p class="indent" >   So we should try to take their teachings inward, as our masters, always teaching
us inside. Whatever they have taught, we should take inward and put into practice.
This way we can be said to be staying with our teachers at all times, just as if
we were to be with the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha everywhere and
always.
<!--l. 65755--><p class="indent" >   Our own practice is the primary mainstay on which we can rely with assurance.
Depending on a teacher isn&#8217;t certain or sure. We are bound to be parted. If he
doesn&#8217;t leave, we leave. If he doesn&#8217;t go, we go &#8212; because he and we all live in the
same world of inconstancy. There is no difference among us. What we can hold to,
though, are the basic principles of his teaching. We hold to them and earnestly put
them into practice so as to see the results, so as to seize victory within the
heart.
<!--l. 65764--><p class="indent" >   Victory of this sort is the supreme victory, unsurpassed in all the world. No other
victory is its equal. We grapple to take victory over ourselves &#8212; over the defilements
that we have believed to be &#8217;ourselves,&#8217; &#8217;us,&#8217; &#8217;ours,&#8217; for aeons and aeons. This is an
enormous undertaking. If you play at it, like children playing with dolls, the
defilements will crush you to bits in no time, because you&#8217;ve been holding onto them
for so long. So don&#8217;t delay. Investigate so as to know clearly and let go, so that
the mind will be clear and free of suffering and stress, and not forever in
disarray.
<!--l. 65774--><p class="indent" >   We&#8217;ve been accumulating the words &#8217;us&#8217; and &#8217;ours&#8217; for countless aeons. If the
defilements were material objects, what in the world could we take for comparison
that would be larger than the pile of defilement, craving, and mental effluents, the
pile of &#8217;us,&#8217; the pile of &#8217;ours&#8217; we&#8217;ve been accumulating for so long? There&#8217;s so much of
it that it would be beyond our strength to drag it out for comparisons. If we were to
drag it out just to pass the time between eating and sleeping &#8212; to chip at it, hack at
it, poke at it, or slash at it once or twice, hoping to break through it &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t
get anywhere at all. We&#8217;d simply be grabbing at handfuls of water, one

after another. So we have to give it our all: This is where we will gain our
victory.
<!--l. 65787--><p class="indent" >   We&#8217;re meditators. We can&#8217;t back away from the fight with the defilements lying
within us. The word &#8217;defilement&#8217; means simply this &#8217;hunk of us.&#8217; The defilements are
&#8217;us,&#8217; &#8217;ours.&#8217; Everything that&#8217;s &#8217;us&#8217; is actually a pile of defilements. There&#8217;s no need to
doubt this. If we want to separate them out so as to see them piece by piece for what
they actually are in line with their true nature, we have to separate them using
persistent effort in the area of mindfulness and discernment as our means of
investigating and evaluating them.
<!--l. 65796--><p class="indent" >   We separate the elements (dhatu), the four elements. Everyone in the world
knows of the four elements, but if we want our knowledge to go straight to the heart,
it has to come from the practice. If we investigate using discernment until we see
distinctly, it will penetrate the heart of its own accord. Once it has reached the heart,
you don&#8217;t have to say anything: The heart will let go of its own accord. Once the
knowledge goes straight to the heart, relinquishment comes straight from
the heart. For us to know straight to the heart and let go straight from
the heart, we have to investigate over and over, again and again, until we
understand.
<!--l. 65807--><p class="indent" >   Don&#8217;t assume that, &#8217;This we&#8217;ve already investigated, that we&#8217;ve already
investigated,&#8217; by setting up expectations, counting the times without seeing deeply
enough to the level of letting go. The work isn&#8217;t done with. It really has to reach the
level of &#8217;done with,&#8217; felt deeply within the heart, which then lets go. If it&#8217;s really done
with, there&#8217;s no need to investigate again, because the heart has understood and can
let go completely.
<!--l. 65815--><p class="indent" >   The elements are already elements. Cognizance is an element. The things that
make contact are also elements. Sights are elements, sounds are elements, all these
things are already elements. As for the khandhas within us, the body (rupa) is a
khandha, feelings (vedana) are a khandha, labels (sañña) are a khandha,
thought-formations (sankhara) are a khandha, cognizance (viññana) is a
khandha. They&#8217;re groups, aggregates, heaps, bits, pieces, all by their very
nature.
<!--l. 65823--><p class="indent" >   As for the mind, know that it&#8217;s the &#8217;knower&#8217; we have to test and comprehend in
the same way as the elements and khandhas so that we won&#8217;t grab hold of it as the
self or as belonging to the self, which would simply be creating a heavier burden. We
must investigate it with discernment so as to see it for what it truly is, in
just the same way. But as I&#8217;ve explained the investigation of the mind in a
number of talks already, you should have a fair understanding of the matter by
now.
<!--l. 65831--><p class="indent" >   In particular, when a pain arises in the body, we should know distinctly that,
&#8217;This is a feeling.&#8217; That&#8217;s all. Don&#8217;t go labeling or interpreting it, saying that the
feeling is us, the feeling is ours, or that anything is ours, for that would
simply foster more and more defilements and bring more and more pain in
to smother the heart. Then when the feeling doesn&#8217;t vanish, that would
cause even more pain in the heart, and what could we possibly find to bear
it?
<!--l. 65839--><p class="indent" >   Pains arise in the body. They&#8217;ve been arising ever since the day we were born.

The moment we came from our mother&#8217;s womb, the pain was excruciating. Only by
surviving this death did we become human beings. If you don&#8217;t call that pain, what
will you call it? Pains have existed ever since way back when. You can&#8217;t
force them to change their ways. The way of pain in the body is that it
continually has to show itself. Once it arises, it remains and then vanishes. That&#8217;s
all there is to it &#8212; arises, remains, vanishes &#8212; regardless of whether it&#8217;s
an external feeling or an internal feeling, namely a feeling or mood in the
mind.
<!--l. 65850--><p class="indent" >   In particular, feelings in the body: Investigate them so as to see them
clearly. The body is the body. We&#8217;ve seen it clearly, known it clearly ever
since the day we were born. We can conjure it into anything &#8212; us, ours, a
prince, a king, nobility, whatever, however we want to conjure it &#8212; but its
truth is simply a truth, fixed and unalterable. It doesn&#8217;t change in line with
what we conjure it up to be. The body is simply the physical khandha. It
has four elements &#8212; earth, water, wind, and fire &#8212; gathered together and
called a person, a woman, a man, classified in endless ways, given this name
and that, but what stays the same is the body: the &#8217;physical heap.&#8217; All the
parts taken together are called the physical heap, which is one reality. Take
out any of the parts, and each of them also has its reality. When they&#8217;re
gathered together, the skin is skin, the flesh is flesh, and the same holds true
for the tendons, bones, and so forth. Even though they have names, don&#8217;t
fall for their names. See them simply as individual realities, as a physical
heap.
<!--l. 65868--><p class="indent" >   As for the heap of feelings, it&#8217;s not the body. The body isn&#8217;t a feeling, such as
pain. Feeling is feeling. Whether pleasure appears, or pain or a neutral feeling
appears, it&#8217;s simply a separate feeling that you can see clearly. These two khandhas
&#8212; the body and feeling &#8212; are more prominent than sañña, sankhara, and viññana,
which arise at intervals and immediately vanish.
<!--l. 65875--><p class="indent" >   Feelings, however, even though they vanish, have a period in which they remain.
This you can clearly see in the practice. When pain arises, focus on it as your target,
as the point to investigate. Don&#8217;t see the pain as being yourself, for that would be
going against the true nature of feelings and the method of investigation, and you
won&#8217;t be able to know the truth of the feeling as you should with your discernment.
When you don&#8217;t know the truth and persist in assuming the pain to be yourself,
you&#8217;ll increase the pain enormously within the mind, because you are going against
the principles of nature, which are the principles of truth the Lord Buddha
taught.
<!--l. 65886--><p class="indent" >   He taught us to investigate so as to see pain &#8212; in whichever part of the body it
may arise &#8212; simply as a phenomenon that arises, remains, and then vanishes in its
own due course. Don&#8217;t get entangled in it. Don&#8217;t fashion or conjure it into being this
or that, if you don&#8217;t want to be forever burdened with pain, with never a moment to
put it down. See its truth the moment it arises, remains, and vanishes. That&#8217;s all
there is to feeling. Ferret it out so as to see it clearly with mindfulness and
discernment.
<!--l. 65895--><p class="indent" >   When you have focused on a feeling, turn and look at the mind to see if the mind
and the feeling are one and the same thing. Then look at the body and the mind: Are

they one and the same? Look at them so as to see them clearly. While you are
investigating, don&#8217;t send the mind out anywhere else. Keep it right at that one spot.
For example, when investigating, focus on the pain so as to see it distinctly. Then
turn to look at the mind so as to see this awareness distinctly. Are they
one and the same? Compare them. This awareness and that feeling: Are
they the same? Can you make them one and the same? And is the body
like the mind? Is it like the feeling? Is it similar enough to be one and the
same?
<!--l. 65907--><p class="indent" >   There! This is the way we&#8217;re taught to separate things so as to see them clearly.
The body is the body &#8212; how can it be like the mind? The mind is a mental
phenomenon, a nature that knows, but the elements of the body are elements that
don&#8217;t know. The earth elements doesn&#8217;t know, the water element doesn&#8217;t know, the
wind element doesn&#8217;t know, the fire element doesn&#8217;t know &#8212; but this mental element
(mano-dhatu) knows. This being the case, how can they be one and the
same?
<!--l. 65916--><p class="indent" >   Similarly with the pain: It&#8217;s an element that doesn&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a phenomenon.
These two unknowing elements are also different: The feeling and the body are
different sorts of things. They aren&#8217;t one and the same. How could you make them
one and the same?
<!--l. 65921--><p class="indent" >   In making distinctions while investigating, look so as to see clearly the way things
actually are. There&#8217;s no need to fear death. There is no death to the mind. Don&#8217;t
create snares to catch yourself and hurt yourself. There is no death; i.e.,
no death to the mind. There is nothing but awareness, pure and simple.
Death doesn&#8217;t exist in the mind, which is something 100% unalterable and
sure.
<!--l. 65928--><p class="indent" >   Death is an assumption that has been conjured up for the mind through the
power of the mind&#8217;s own delusion. The mind has conjured it up to deceive itself. So
once we&#8217;ve investigated in line with the truth &#8212; that the mind is not something that
dies &#8212; what reason will we have to fear death? What is &#8217;death&#8217;? We know that the
elements and khandhas fall apart. We human beings, when we&#8217;ve stopped breathing,
are called &#8217;dead people.&#8217; At that moment the &#8217;knower&#8217; separates from the elements,
so that nothing is left but physical elements with no feelings: That&#8217;s a &#8217;dead
person.&#8217;
<!--l. 65938--><p class="indent" >   But actually the knower doesn&#8217;t die, so we have to investigate in order to see this
clearly with discernment. We needn&#8217;t create the issue of death to stab or snare the
heart or to obstruct the path we are following for the sake of seeing and knowing the
truth through investigation. No matter how great or how little the pain, keep your
attention well fixed on the affairs of that pain. Use the pain as a whetstone for
sharpening discernment. Separate the pain from the mind. Separate the
mind from the pain. Be able to compare their every aspect. Be careful not
to let your attention wander while investigating, so that you&#8217;ll be able to
see and know the truth while in hand-to-hand combat with that particular
khandha.
<!--l. 65950--><p class="indent" >   Now, if it should happen that the mind dies as the world supposes &#8212; if it
should die while you&#8217;re making your investigation &#8212; then make sure you
know what dies first and what dies after. When does the feeling vanish?

When does the mind vanish? Where does it vanish to? Actually the mind by
nature is not something that vanishes. How can anyone come and make it
vanish?
<!--l. 65957--><p class="indent" >   Investigate carefully between the mind and the khandha until the truth is
absolutely clear to the heart and your doubts vanish. This is called training
discernment, developing discernment so as to see the truth.
<!--l. 65961--><p class="indent" >   No matter how great the pain arising at that moment, it won&#8217;t have the power to
affect the mind at all. Once we see the mind as the mind, the feeling as feeling &#8212;
once discernment has seen clearly in this way that the khandhas and the mind are
real in their own separate ways &#8212; they won&#8217;t infringe on one another at all. The
body is simply the body and stays as it is. When the pain appears, the body is still
there. When the pain vanishes, every part of the body remains, in accordance with its
own nature. If the feeling arises, that&#8217;s the feeling&#8217;s business. If it remains,
that&#8217;s the feeling&#8217;s business. If it vanishes, that the feeling&#8217;s business. The
mind is the one who knows that the pain arises, remains, and vanishes. The
mind isn&#8217;t the one who arises, remains, and vanishes like the body or the
feeling.
<!--l. 65975--><p class="indent" >   Once you have investigated this way until you&#8217;re adept, then when the
chips are down, investigate in the same way. You needn&#8217;t fear death, because
you&#8217;re a warrior. Fear of death is not the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha. The
Dhamma is a matter of courage in the face of the truth. This is the basic
principle of the svakkhata dhamma: the well-taught teaching. Follow in the
path of this truth. If the time comes to die, be ready to die. There is no
need to fear, because the mind doesn&#8217;t die &#8212; but be sure to know clearly
what is appearing at that moment. For example, the pain: What is it like?
Look at it so as to know its truth. Once you have seen its truth, then the
pain is simply a phenomenon. It doesn&#8217;t have any meaning, good or bad, at
all. And it doesn&#8217;t act as anyone&#8217;s enemy. It&#8217;s simply its own full reality,
displaying itself in line with natural principles. The body is also its own
reality, appearing in line with its own principles. The mind is a separate
phenomenon that constantly knows and doesn&#8217;t intermingle with anything
else.
<!--l. 65992--><p class="indent" >   When you have investigated so as to know all-around, the mind extricates itself to
be its own reality in full measure. The pain has its own fullness in line with its
nature; the body has its own fullness in line with its nature, in that the mind doesn&#8217;t
create any turmoil, trying to lay claim to anything of theirs. This being the case,
nothing disturbs anything else. Pain, no matter how great, has no impact on the
mind. You can smile even while great pain is arising &#8212; you can smile! &#8212;
because the mind is something separate, not involving itself with the feeling. It
doesn&#8217;t intermingle with the pain so as to burn itself. This way, the heart is at
ease.
<!--l. 66003--><p class="indent" >   This, then, is the investigation of pain so as to comprehend it, by taking pain as
your battlefield, as a whetstone for discernment, as the place where you temper and
sharpen discernment by investigating and dissecting the pains that arise.
Single out the body and single out the feeling. Which will vanish first, which
will vanish after, try to know in accordance with their truth. Arising and

vanishing have always been a part of their nature from time immemorial.
Regardless of whether or not you&#8217;ve been aware of it, these have been their
inherent characteristics. All you need to do is to investigate so as to see in
line with their truth, so as not to resist the Dhamma, and you can live at
ease.
<!--l. 66015--><p class="indent" >   So. If the time comes to die, let the body die &#8212; as the conventions of the world
understand &#8217;dying.&#8217; The body falls apart, so let it fall apart. Whatever is going to
disintegrate, let it go &#8212; but that which doesn&#8217;t disintegrate remains. That which
doesn&#8217;t disintegrate is this mind.
<!--l. 66021--><p class="indent" >   This mind, once it has developed discernment as a standard within itself, is really
like this, with no flinching in the face of illness or death. The mind is courageous and
capable.
<!--l. 66025--><p class="indent" >   There, then. This is how we investigate our affairs &#8212; the affairs of the mind. We
needn&#8217;t fear death. Why fear it? The Buddha taught us not to fear. The
Dhamma doesn&#8217;t teach us to fear. The truth is nothing frightening, because it&#8217;s
the truth. What&#8217;s frightening or emboldening about it? Courage? There&#8217;s
nothing that calls for courage. Fear? There&#8217;s nothing that calls for fear. Here
I&#8217;m talking about the level where we have reached pure truth. There&#8217;s no
trace of the words &#8217;courage&#8217; or &#8217;fear&#8217; left in the heart at all. There&#8217;s only
purity.
<!--l. 66034--><p class="indent" >   But while investigating so as to reach the truth, we need to have courage. When
we are going to seize victory for ourselves, we can&#8217;t not have courage. Otherwise we&#8217;ll
lose. This is because we&#8217;re following the path. We need courage and daring, with no
fear or intimidation in the face of anything at all. Whatever comes our way, we must
investigate so as to know and understand it, without growing discouraged or weak, so
as to be intent on knowing and seeing it in line with its truth &#8212; everything of every
sort that comes into the range of our awareness. This is called being a warrior in the
combat between the mind and khandhas, or between the Dhamma and the
defilements.
<!--l. 66045--><p class="indent" >   Courage of this sort is proper and right. Once we&#8217;ve reached the goal, fear
disappears, courage disappears, because we have gained full victory. Fear and courage
are no longer an issue.
<!--l. 66049--><p class="indent" >   But right now fear and courage are a critical issue for those still on the way.
Develop courage with discretion in the areas that call for courage. Be a fighter
with the things that call for fight &#8212; such as feelings of pain &#8212; so as to
see in line with their truth. Don&#8217;t be afraid. The Buddha taught us not to
fear. Fear has the same value as death. When the time comes, things have
to fall apart. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s called &#8217;death.&#8217; But in any event, meditators
have to come to know with discernment before these things undergo their
transformation. Spread a net of discernment around yourself on all sides.
Whatever appears will be caught in the net of discernment, so what is there
to fear? What is there to be anxious about? What is there to knock you
off balance? Everything simply follows its truth, which you have already
investigated.
<!--l. 66063--><p class="indent" >   This is how &#8217;warriors&#8217; investigate. Even though they&#8217;re in the midst of
khandhas that are a solid mass of flame, they&#8217;re calm and at ease, with

the normalcy of a mind that has completely comprehended, without being
deluded by any phenomenon. This is what&#8217;s meant by one who &#8217;knows all
around.&#8217;
<!--l. 66069--><p class="indent" >   Whatever the symptoms displayed by the body, if they are endurable, we endure
them. We care for the body, look after it, nourish it, make it eat, make it sleep, make
it drink, take care of it in accordance with its nature. If its symptoms are
unendurable and it&#8217;s simply going to go, then just let it go in accordance with the
ways of nature. It&#8217;s a truth, so how can you thwart it? Let it go in line with
the truth. This is called letting go with knowledge that accords with the
truth. The mind feels no attachment, no regrets. This is the basic principle of
practice for one who has attained, or is about to attain, victory within the
heart.
<!--l. 66080--><p class="indent" >   Previously, the mind has always lost out to defilement and craving. It has never,
until now, defeated them. For aeons and aeons it has lived entirely under the sway of
the defilements to the point where it has forgotten to realize that &#8217;The defilements
are the boss. We&#8217;re their servant.&#8217;
<!--l. 66086--><p class="indent" >   But now we&#8217;re going to turn over a new us, using the principles of the Dhamma
as means to subjugate the defilements and mental effluents that have been
subjugating us, or that have been the ruling elite, the big bosses of the cycle of
rebirth, forcing the mind to go here and there for so long. Now we&#8217;re going to set our
hearts on contending with the defilements for victory so as to see the truth of
everything of every sort, with nothing to obscure our discernment at all. At the same
time, we will take victory for our own &#8212; after having been defeated for so long &#8212;
using the power of unflagging mindfulness, discernment, conviction, and
perseverance.
<!--l. 66097--><p class="indent" >   Those who have reached the realm of excellence through perseverance have a
dignity that outshines that of others. At the same time, they can take pride in
their own perseverance. Those who have reached the realm of excellence
through gaining victory over themselves, and no one else, are supreme within
themselves, with no creation of animosity &#8212; unlike victory in war, with
which the world creates endless animosities, like links in a chain. To gain
victory over oneself, though, is to gain the foremost victory. As the Dhamma
says,
<!--l. 66106--><p class="indent" >   atta have jitam seyyo:
<!--l. 66108--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;It is better to gain victory over oneself.&#8217;
<!--l. 66110--><p class="indent" >   The things that have created turmoil for the heart, causing it suffering and stress
in the past, now come to an absolute stop. In what I have been saying, don&#8217;t forget
that perseverance is the important factor, the factor that supports mindfulness and
discernment as the trailblazers for the sake of progress in our work. Discernment is
very important for investigating and exploring so as to see causes and effects.
Mindfulness supervises the work, to keep our attention from straying. When
discernment has investigated so as to see the truth of such things as the five
khandhas, the defilements will have no place to hide and so will come pouring
together into one place &#8212; into the heart. They have no other place to hold onto, no
other place to attach themselves, because all such places have been obliterated by
discernment.

<!--l. 66123--><p class="indent" >   The next stage is to lay siege to the heart, where the enemies lie gathered, so
as to disperse them from it until nothing is left. There! That&#8217;s called the
death of the defilements. They die right there, right there in the heart where
they&#8217;ve always been. They&#8217;ve lived there; and when they die, they die there
through the power of the most up-to-the-minute &#8217;super-mindfulness&#8217; and
&#8217;super-discernment.&#8217; This is called full victory. The supreme victory is won right here.
The teachings of the religion all converge at this point. The final stage in their
practice comes to an end right here. We finish our task right here. When
we reach the realm of release from suffering and stress, we reach it right
here.
<!--l. 66135--><p class="indent" >   Aside from this, there is nothing: no time, no place, no future, no past. As for the
present, we are wise to everything of every sort. We have no more issues, no more
disputes. There are no more cases in court between defilement and the mind.
Super-mindfulness and super-discernment have sat on the bench and handed down a
death sentence for defilement and all its tribe. There is nothing left to carry on the
lineage of birth and being. At that moment, defilement and all its tribe sink
out of sight. This is called reaching nibbana: a heart truly constant and
sure.
<!--l. 66145--><p class="indent" >   All the various conditions that used to deceive the mind no longer exist. All that
remains is pure awareness. Even though the khandhas &#8212; rupa, vedana, sañña,
sankhara, and viññana &#8212; may form in accordance with their nature, they simply go
their own way, which has no meaning in terms of defilement at all. The body behaves
in its &#8217;body way.&#8217; Feelings &#8212; pleasure, pain, neither pleasure nor pain, which appear
in the body &#8212; behave in the way of feelings. Sañña &#8212; labels, acts of recognition &#8212;
behave in their own way. Sankhara &#8212; the various thought-formations &#8212; behave
in line with their own nature. Viññana &#8212; acts of noticing when external
objects come into contact with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind
&#8212; notice and vanish, notice and vanish, in line with their nature, without
being able to provoke the mind as before, because the things that cause
provocation have all been destroyed without leaving a trace. These are thus called
&#8217;khandhas pure and simple.&#8217; The mind has reached nibbana in the midst of
khandhas pure and simple. This is to reach living nibbana: the mind purified of
defilement.
<!--l. 66164--><p class="indent" >   Those who have reached this point, you know, don&#8217;t ask where nibbana is. And
why should they? What is nibbana, actually? The word nibbana is a name. The
nature we call nibbana is the actual thing. When you reach the actual thing,
why ask the name? Why ask for traces and signs? What is there left to
grope for? Those who really know don&#8217;t grope, aren&#8217;t hungry, don&#8217;t lack
&#8212; because they have reached &#8217;enough,&#8217; completely, of everything of every
sort.
<!--l. 66172--><p class="indent" >   So. That should be enough explanation for now. I ask that we as meditators take
this and contemplate it so as to see the truth I have mentioned. We will then be
complete in our hearts, as I have described, without a doubt.
<!--l. 66177--><p class="indent" >   So I&#8217;ll ask to stop here.
<!--l. 66179--><p class="indent" >   The Principle of the Present
<!--l. 66181--><p class="indent" >   To practice is to search for principles leading to the truth. To study is like

studying a plan &#8212; although people for the most part don&#8217;t follow the plan &#8212; but
outer plans and inner plans are worlds apart.
<!--l. 66186--><p class="indent" >   With outer plans &#8212; like blueprints of a house or a building, or maps that tell
where roads and places are located &#8212; the builder examines the blueprint and follows
it; the traveler follows the routes that appear on the map, but if he gets a map that&#8217;s
out-of-date, there are bound to be things that have come into being or been torn
down that don&#8217;t show on the map. This can cause him to misunderstand and to
follow the wrong route.
<!--l. 66194--><p class="indent" >   Inner plans, though &#8212; such as the 32 parts of the body, the elements, and the
khandhas, which the Buddha taught us to study and to put into practice so as to
derive benefits from them &#8212; are fixed truths, unchanged from the Buddha&#8217;s time to
the present. But with these plans within the mind, we can&#8217;t act like a builder who
follows the blueprint in his hands, because that would go against the principle of the
present, which is where the Dhamma arises. For example, when we study and
understand in line with the texts and then practice, it&#8217;s hard not to speculate in
reference to the texts; and so when we practice or try to develop concentration in
the mind, we&#8217;ll find that the mind has trouble growing still, because of the
disturbance.
<!--l. 66206--><p class="indent" >   If, while practicing the Dhamma, we contemplate or reflect on whatever Dhamma
we have studied, it&#8217;s bound to get all confused, because the mind&#8217;s state is not such
that these things can be contemplated, pondered, or compared with the mind at the
moment it&#8217;s gathering itself together to gain strength. This is why we shouldn&#8217;t bring
anything in to disturb it at all. Let there simply be the &#8217;Dhamma theme,&#8217; the
meditation theme we bring in to supervise the mind, as if we were charging
the mind so as to give it inner strength &#8212; in other words, so as to make it
still.
<!--l. 66216--><p class="indent" >   When the mind is still, it gains inner strength. Regardless of how much or how
little knowledge it has, no trouble or confusion results, because the mind
has its footing. It&#8217;s secure. Calm. Peaceful within itself &#8212; all because of
the stillness, which is a gathering of energy. This isn&#8217;t in the plan at all &#8212;
because while we are practicing, we aren&#8217;t concerned with the texts. We&#8217;re
intent solely on developing concentration in the present until we gain results
&#8212; peace, well-being, and various other satisfactory states &#8212; there in that
moment.
<!--l. 66226--><p class="indent" >   If this is in the plan, it&#8217;s in the part that says, &#8217;Try to make the mind stay with
just a single Dhamma theme &#8212; its meditation word.&#8217; Don&#8217;t get involved with other
topics at that moment. If you let it think of the texts while practicing concentration,
it won&#8217;t be willing to stick just with that practice. A great deal of extraneous
knowledge will interfere, disrupting the mind until everything is a turmoil, and
no stillness will result. This is called going against the plan taught by the
Buddha.
<!--l. 66235--><p class="indent" >   Whatever plans we&#8217;ve been given, however many, however much Dhamma the
Buddha taught, we gather it all to our own confusion. It&#8217;s as if we were building a
hut and yet went around to gather up plans for hundred-story buildings and
spread them out for a look. They just don&#8217;t go together. The plan for a
building and the plan for a hut are as different as earth and sky, and yet here

we are going to gather the mind into one point, which is like building a
hut. Only after we have the strength can we then begin enlarging it into a
building.
<!--l. 66244--><p class="indent" >   When we ultimately reach the level where we are ready to investigate, there are
no limits as to how broad or restricted it should be. The mind can investigate
everything throughout the cosmos. When we reach the level where we should
investigate, that&#8217;s the level where we&#8217;ll gain firm confirmation in the mind. We&#8217;ll gain
knowledge and all kinds of insights from our own investigation. This is where the fun
lies &#8212; sifting, choosing with our discernment what is right and what is wrong. We&#8217;ll
go back, exploring through the Dhamma we have already studied and compare it
with the causes and results in our practice until they agree, and then we can set the
matter to rest. Even though we may have already understood clearly, we still have to
gain confirmation to give it further support, for the sake of full conviction and
certainty.
<!--l. 66258--><p class="indent" >   This is what&#8217;s meant by discernment. It&#8217;s not the case that if we have no
doubts then there&#8217;s no reason to make comparisons. The Dhamma of the
doctrine is one thing, the Dhamma of the practice is another. We take the
Buddha&#8217;s wealth and compare it with our own wealth, gained from our practice.
If they match, we can accept the matter and put it aside, with no more
concern.
<!--l. 66265--><p class="indent" >   In particular, when we practice in line with the four Noble Truths or the four
foundations of mindfulness (satipatthana), these are things that the Buddha
described as being interconnected. If we practice them one by one, in line with the
texts &#8212; investigating the body, and then feeling, and then the mind, and then mental
events &#8212; we&#8217;ll be wrong the livelong day, because these things by their nature are
interconnected at all times. We can investigate whichever aspect we want.
Whichever aspect feels most natural to us, we should start with that one
first.
<!--l. 66275--><p class="indent" >   By and large, we start out by investigating the body. But when a pain
appears, we have to let go of the body and focus on the pain. We then consider
the pain in relation to the body, distinguishing between the two so that
we understand them clearly. Then we distinguish between the pain in the
body and the pain in the mind, comparing them and distinguishing between
them again. Body, feeling, mind, and mental events lie together in the same
moment. So we separate out the body &#8212; in other words, investigate it &#8212; and
then separate out the feeling so as to know whether or not the body and
feeling are one and the same. Then we separate the mind from the mental
events within the mind, so as to see that each of these events is not the same
thing as the mind. To say just this much covers all four of the foundations of
mindfulness.
<!--l. 66289--><p class="indent" >   We can&#8217;t divide these things and deal with them one at a time, one after another,
the way we take one step after another while walking. To do so is wrong. This is the
way it is with the practice: When we investigate one aspect or another of the four
foundations of mindfulness or the four Noble Truths, they all become involved of
their own accord &#8212; because they are interconnected phenomena. The Buddha says,
for example,

<!--l. 66297--><p class="indent" >   kaye kayanupassa viharati: &#8217;Investigate the body within the body.&#8217;
<!--l. 66299--><p class="indent" >   Now, the phrase, &#8217;the body within the body&#8217; means to start out with any one of
the many parts of the body. Once we have contemplated that part until we gain an
understanding, our investigation then permeates further of its own accord, making us
curious about this part and that. This keeps spreading and spreading until it reaches
everything in the body. In other words, it covers everything and understands
everything.
<!--l. 66306--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;The body within the body&#8217; &#8212; for example, kesa, hair of the head: Even though
we may contemplate only one hair on the head, it has an impact on our
understanding of how may hairs on the head? And then connects up with how many
parts of the body? It affects everything. It permeates everything, because everything
is interrelated. No matter what we investigate, this is the way it goes, in line with the
principles of investigation in the area of the practice that the Noble Ones have
followed.
<!--l. 66315--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Feeling&#8217;: It arises in our body. Focus on whichever one point is very
pronounced. Investigate it &#8212; whichever point is more painful than the rest.
When we focus on that as a starting point, our investigation will spread
to all other feelings because no matter where they arise, they all become
involved with the one mind. As soon as we investigate a feeling, the mind and
the feeling immediately fly toward each other, and then we separate them
out, because the four foundations of mindfulness &#8212; contemplation of body,
feelings, mind, and mental events &#8212; are interrelated in this way. &#8217;External
feelings&#8217; refer to physical feelings, feelings of pleasure, pain, and neither
pleasure nor pain in the various parts of the body. &#8217;Internal feelings&#8217; refer to
the feelings of pain, pleasure, and neither pleasure nor pain in the heart.
These are also counted as feelings that occur in the hearts of ordinary people
everywhere.
<!--l. 66330--><p class="indent" >   These three kinds of feelings: Even when we&#8217;re meditating and the mind enters
into stillness, it still has a feeling of pleasure. But ordinarily, people usually have
feelings of pain and discontent within the heart. If we don&#8217;t investigate &#8212; for
example, if we&#8217;ve never practiced the Dhamma &#8212; these three feelings also exist, but
they&#8217;re worldly feelings, not the feelings connected with the Dhamma of those who
practice meditation.
<!--l. 66338--><p class="indent" >   When we practice, and the mind is still and calm, there is a feeling of pleasure. If
the mind doesn&#8217;t settle down and grow still as we want it to, feelings of bodily and
mental pain or distress arise. Sometimes the mind is vacant, drifting, indifferent,
something of the sort. You can&#8217;t call it pleasure or pain. It&#8217;s simply vacant and
drifting &#8212; something like that &#8212; in the mind of the meditator. This doesn&#8217;t
mean vacant and drifting in the sense of someone completely oblivious. It&#8217;s
simply a state in the mind. This is called a feeling of neither pleasure nor
pain.
<!--l. 66348--><p class="indent" >   At present, we aren&#8217;t yet aware of these things &#8212; even now, when they&#8217;re very
pronounced. We aren&#8217;t yet aware because we don&#8217;t yet have the discernment. When
the mind becomes more refined, then whatever appears, whatever state arises, we are
bound to know, and to know increasingly, in line with the strength of our own
mindfulness and discernment. Actually, these things are the bosses, lording it over

the heart: Okay, for once let&#8217;s call them what they are, because that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve
actually been all along.
<!--l. 66357--><p class="indent" >   The heart is their vessel, their seat. That&#8217;s where they sit. Or you could say it&#8217;s
their toilet, because that&#8217;s where they defecate. Whichever one comes along, it gets
right up there on the heart. Now pain jumps up there and defecates. Now
pleasure gets up there and defecates. Now a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain
gets up there and defecates. They keep defecating like this, and the heart
is content to let them do this, because it doesn&#8217;t have the mindfulness or
discernment to shake them off and not let them defecate. This is why we have to
develop a great deal of mindfulness and discernment so that we can fight them
off.
<!--l. 66368--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness is crucial. It has to keep track constantly, because it&#8217;s the supervisor
of the work. No matter where discernment goes scrutinizing, no matter what it thinks
about, mindfulness sticks right with it. Discernment contemplates and mindfulness
follows right along with it. This is why it doesn&#8217;t turn into sañña. As soon
as we let mindfulness lapse, discernment turns into sañña, in accordance
with the weakness of the mind just learning how to explore. But once we
become more proficient in the areas of both mindfulness and discernment, the
two stick so close together that we can say that there&#8217;s never a moment
when the mind&#8217;s attention lapses &#8212; except when we sleep, at which time
mindfulness and discernment don&#8217;t have to work, and even the defilements take a
rest.
<!--l. 66381--><p class="indent" >   Once we reach this level, there is never a moment where the mind&#8217;s attention
lapses. This is thus called super-mindfulness and super-discernment. How could it
lapse? It stays right with &#8217;what knows &#8217; at all times. Mindfulness and discernment
exist together in this one mind and have become one and the same thing. So where
could they lapse? Once mindfulness and discernment are continuous, we can speak in
this way.
<!--l. 66388--><p class="indent" >   Before, we were never able to know how much the mind scrambled, stumbled, and
fell. But when we reach the level where these things become one and the same, then
as soon as there&#8217;s a rippling in the mind, we are right there up on it. Instantly.
Instantly. Whatever gets thought, we are progressively more and more up on it. And
especially if it&#8217;s a matter of defilement, then mindfulness and discernment are extra
quick. But if the mind is an ordinary mind, it doesn&#8217;t know. Even if defilements climb
up and defecate on our head from dawn to dusk and from dusk to dawn, we can&#8217;t be
aware of them.
<!--l. 66398--><p class="indent" >   In the area of the practice, we practice on our own and know on our own.
That&#8217;s when things become clear. Let&#8217;s see right and wrong clearly within
ourselves. Let&#8217;s know things clearly within ourselves. Only then can we be
certain. Once we have practiced and come to know, we can be courageous in
what we say and courageous within the heart, with no fear that we might be
speaking wrongly or venturing guesses. We are sure of ourselves from having
practiced.
<!--l. 66406--><p class="indent" >   To strip away the things that bind the heart has to be difficult. For those who are
weak-willed, it&#8217;s especially difficult. There is no way they can succeed, because they
keep creating obstacles for themselves whenever they are about to develop goodness

or break away the binding of unawareness and craving from around the
heart. To break open the binding of the wheel of rebirth depends mainly
on our being earnest and intent: That&#8217;s what will clear our way. This is
why living beings don&#8217;t want to touch that binding, don&#8217;t want to break it
open.
<!--l. 66415--><p class="indent" >   Our earnest intent is what will lead us to know exactly how extraordinary the
things taught by the Buddha really are. When we have this kind of earnest intent
toward the Dhamma filling the heart, then no matter how difficult things become, we
won&#8217;t let that difficulty bother us or become an obstacle. We want solely to
know, to see, to understand. We feel motivated solely to think, ponder, and
investigate in line with the aspects of the Dhamma we want to know and
see.
<!--l. 66423--><p class="indent" >   This has us engrossed day and night &#8212; engrossed in our desire to know and see,
engrossed in the results we obtain step by step, engrossed in probing and
cutting away the defilements and mental effluents. These lie nowhere but in
the heart &#8212; except when the heart grabs hold of external things that are
harmful and toxic, and brings them inward to overpower itself to no purpose.
The mind thus has to probe, investigate, remedy, and slash away inside
itself because these are the things that bind the heart. The heart is what
makes itself unruly and reckless, roaming about, collecting these things to
burn itself, because it doesn&#8217;t have the good sense to avoid them or remedy
them. For this reason, we need to develop a great deal of mindfulness and
discernment.
<!--l. 66436--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha was always teaching mindfulness and discernment.
<!--l. 66438--><p class="indent" >   nisamma karanam seyyo:
<!--l. 66440--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Use discernment to consider before doing anything,&#8217; in order to guard against
error. Both in inner and outer activities, mindfulness and discernment are always
important. But usually when the mind thinks of doing anything, we don&#8217;t consider it
first. Even if we don&#8217;t consider things while we think of doing them, we should at
least consider them when the mind has made contact with one matter or
another, and trouble arises as a result. But usually we don&#8217;t see the harm of
our own recklessness, and this is why we never learn. So we keep thinking
and acting in our old ways repeatedly, and the results are thus unceasing
stress.
<!--l. 66450--><p class="indent" >   We shouldn&#8217;t guess, we shouldn&#8217;t anticipate what the practice will be like.
Where is heaven? Don&#8217;t guess about it. Where are the Brahma worlds? Don&#8217;t
waste your time anticipating. Where is stress? Its cause? Its cessation? The
path? Don&#8217;t anticipate their being anywhere outside the body and mind that
are in contact with each other and with these various things at all times.
Focus right here, so as to see the truth in line with the principles of the
Dhamma.
<!--l. 66458--><p class="indent" >   You&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s outside; you&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s inside. Especially when you know
what&#8217;s inside, that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll gain insight into everything that exists, in line with
your temperament and abilities, without your anticipating it. The mind will simply
know of its own accord. Your basic problem is that you don&#8217;t yet know yourself inside
and simply want to know what&#8217;s outside. This will only make you agitated and

confused, without serving any purpose.
<!--l. 66466--><p class="indent" >   If you want to gather matters into yourself so as to see the truth, then: What is
hell? And where is it? If you want to know hell, then go ahead. Where is it? Where is
the suffering that the defilements dig up, the suffering they produce in ascending
stages? If it doesn&#8217;t lie in the body and mind, where does it lie? If, when you let
yourself fall into hell and the fires of hell burn you day and night, you still don&#8217;t
know where hell is, then where else are you going to look for it? Bring things
inward in this way so as to know the truth: the Noble Truths that lie within
you. Once you know the Noble Truths, you&#8217;ll understand every pit in hell
without having to ask anyone. Think of how much the Buddha and his Noble
Disciples knew about hell &#8212; and yet who told them about it? How is it
that they were able to know and see to the point of teaching us into the
present?
<!--l. 66480--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Heaven&#8217; is the enjoyment, the sense of exhilaration in the Dhamma, in the
goodness and merit that lie within the heart, causing it to be calm and at peace. This
is your &#8217;heavenly treasure.&#8217; The Brahma worlds lie with the levels of the
mind. No matter which level of the Brahma worlds you want to reach, they
are all levels of the mind that indicate on their own that this mental state
corresponds to this level or that and that have the characteristics of those levels.
For this reason, you have to put &#8217;this one&#8217; &#8212; the mind &#8212; into good shape,
into proper shape. Don&#8217;t go concerning yourself with anything other than
this.
<!--l. 66491--><p class="indent" >   Every day, every night, we should probe into our own minds, together
with the things that become involved with them. The important factors are
the body &#8212; this is very important &#8212; and the five khandhas. These things
are always making contact because they have been together with us since
way back when. Things outside &#8212; sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile
sensations &#8212; sometimes subside, but the five khandhas and the heart are
always together and always at issue with one another. There is no one who
can decide these issues and put an end to them unless we use mindfulness
and discernment as our judges to make a decision that will put the case to
rest.
<!--l. 66503--><p class="indent" >   Normally, rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana lie right with us, with the
heart. They are interconnected and interrelated to the point where no one can
untangle the case and pass a verdict, because we don&#8217;t have the discernment to
deliberate and decide what verdict to pass. So we simply let issues arise all the time:
&#8217;That hurts. This aches. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll faint. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll die.&#8217; We really are afraid
&#8212; as if by fearing to the utmost, straight to the heart, we could somehow escape
death.
<!--l. 66512--><p class="indent" >   This fear of death: We really fear it and yet we don&#8217;t know what death is, or who
dies. As long as we haven&#8217;t investigated down to the &#8217;foundation of death,&#8217; we&#8217;ll
have to fear it all the livelong day. But once we have investigated down to
the foundation of death, what is there to fear? &#8212; because nothing in the
world dies. There is simply the change, the exchange of the various elements,
and that&#8217;s all. Change is something we already know. The Dhamma has
taught us: &#8217;Inconstancy&#8217; &#8212; things are always changing. &#8217;Stress&#8217; &#8212; where is

there if not right here? &#8217;Not-self&#8217; &#8212; this already tells us &#8212; what is there
of any substance, that&#8217;s &#8217;us&#8217; or &#8217;them&#8217;? The Dhamma tells us with every
word, every phrase, and yet we prefer to fly in the face of the Dhamma. We
want that to be us, we want this to be ours. This wanting is an affair of
defilement: That&#8217;s not us, it&#8217;s simply defilement from head to toe &#8212; or isn&#8217;t
it?
<!--l. 66528--><p class="indent" >   If it were to become our self as we say it is, wouldn&#8217;t it be a heap as big as a
mountain? If every defilement of every sort were to be gathered together, who knows
how many millions of mountains they&#8217;d be? We wouldn&#8217;t be able to carry them at all.
What we already have is more than we can handle! So we should investigate
these things to see them clearly and then cut them away, one mountain
at a time. Otherwise we&#8217;ll be unable to walk, because we&#8217;ll be full of the
mountains of every person&#8217;s every sort of defilement, and of every sort of
suffering that defilement has created to be borne on top of the heart for such a
long, long time. We should learn our lessons, in line with what the Dhamma
has taught us, so that we will have some place to put down our burden of
suffering.
<!--l. 66541--><p class="indent" >   Feelings &#8212; these characters: These are our enemies. All they offer us are feelings
of pain or distress arising in the mind &#8212; sometimes on their own, with no connection
to the body. The body may be perfectly normal, but because of our preoccupations,
feelings of pain can manage to arise in the mind. If we think of something
that stabs at the heart, a feeling of pain or distress arises. If we think in
a way that will extricate us, a feeling of pleasure arises. When the mind
rests and stays neutral within itself, that&#8217;s a feeling of equanimity. See? We
can clearly see them like this &#8212; if we reflect so as to see them. If we aren&#8217;t
observant, if we don&#8217;t investigate them, we won&#8217;t see them to our dying day. We
will simply die in vain. Don&#8217;t go thinking that we can gain knowledge and
insight, and free ourselves of suffering, without making an effort to strive and
investigate. Many, many living beings have died in failure because of their
complacency.
<!--l. 66557--><p class="indent" >   In investigating, don&#8217;t set up any anticipations that you would like to
have your different feelings disappear. That would only be increasing the
cause of stress. Simply look inside the feeling itself when it arises. Use your
mindfulness and discernment to contemplate without let-up. Investigate until you
understand.
<!--l. 66563--><p class="indent" >   Sañña: This is very important. Normally, sañña is something very important.
When pain arises, the pain is important, but pain doesn&#8217;t arise all the time. As for
sañña, it keeps right on labeling. This is very important, very subtle, very delicate
and refined. It&#8217;s deceptive, which is why it has us deceived.
<!--l. 66569--><p class="indent" >   Sankhara is what hands things over to sañña, which elaborates on them to the
point where they become endless and unstoppable unless we use mindfulness and
discernment to act as a block.
<!--l. 66573--><p class="indent" >   Viññana is what takes note.
<!--l. 66575--><p class="indent" >   As for sañña &#8212; labeling and interpreting &#8212; it has a big job to do, running
around stirring up all kinds of trouble throughout the body. Sañña is what
hoodwinks the heart, making it fall for labels until it can&#8217;t see the harm they wreak

in the five khandhas. Sañña is the primary culprit. Meditation circles are well aware
of it, which is why they warn us.
<!--l. 66582--><p class="indent" >   When the mind has things like this burying it, obstructing it, and coercing it, it
can&#8217;t display even the least little bit of ingenious strategy, because they have it
overpowered. For this reason, we have to force the mind to investigate and unravel its
various preoccupations so that it can see its way clear. Its various labels and
interpretations are gradually peeled off or removed, step by step. Mindfulness and
discernment are then freed to think and develop more of their own strength.
When we reach the stage where mindfulness and discernment come out to
investigate, nothing can stay hidden. Mindfulness and discernment will probe into
everything, into every nook and cranny, understanding continually more and
more &#8212; engrossed in their contemplations and explorations, engrossed in the
results that keep appearing &#8212; because to probe with discernment is a direct
way of cutting defilement away so that we see results, step by step, without
pause.
<!--l. 66598--><p class="indent" >   Concentration is simply a tactic for herding the various defilements into one
focal point so that we can rectify or destroy them more easily. To put it
simply, concentration is strength for discernment. When the mind gathers
in the levels of concentration, it is content to work from various angles in
the area of mindfulness and discernment. When it&#8217;s working, the results of
its work appear. The defilements fall away one after another. The heart
becomes engrossed in the results of its work and investigates even more, never
having its fill, like spring water flowing continually throughout the rainy
season.
<!--l. 66608--><p class="indent" >   So focus right here. Don&#8217;t go anywhere else. The Noble Truths are right here in
the body and heart. Ultimately, they come down solely to the heart. Probe down into
the heart. How is it that we don&#8217;t know? Where did the Buddha know? He knew
right here in the area of these four Noble Truths. He knew in the area of these four
foundations of mindfulness, which lie in the bodies and hearts of us all. The Buddha
knew right here and he taught right here. So investigate to see clearly right here.
Defilement, the paths, the fruitions, and nibbana lie right here. Don&#8217;t imagine
them to be anywhere else. You&#8217;ll simply be pouncing on shadows outside of
yourself and grasping fistfuls of water, without ever meeting with the real
Dhamma.
<!--l. 66620--><p class="indent" >   In focusing your investigation when a feeling arises in the mind &#8212; as for feelings
in the body, we&#8217;ve discussed them at great length already &#8212; when a feeling of stress
or pain, such as a mood of distress, arises within the mind, focus on that feeling of
distress. Take that feeling of distress as the target of your watchfulness and
investigation. Keep alert to it. Don&#8217;t set up any desires for it to vanish once it has
appeared in the mind. Make yourself aware that the feeling of distress arising in the
mind has to have a cause. It can&#8217;t just come floating in without a cause. If you don&#8217;t
know its cause, focus on the result &#8212; the distress itself &#8212; as the heart&#8217;s
preoccupation. Keep aware right at the heart. Focus on contemplating and
unraveling the feeling of distress right there. Don&#8217;t let go of that feeling to go
looking or investigating elsewhere. Otherwise you will make the mind waver,
without ever being able to establish a foothold and it will become shiftless and

irresolute.
<!--l. 66636--><p class="indent" >   However long that distress will have to last, keep looking at it to see if it&#8217;s really
constant, solid, and lasting. Your mind is something more lasting than the feeling, so
why won&#8217;t it be able to investigate it? The feeling arises only for a period and then
vanishes when its time is up, when it no longer has any supporting conditions.
Since the mind by its nature is something that knows, then even though a
feeling of distress arises, it still knows. Whether there is a little distress or
a lot, it knows &#8212; so why won&#8217;t it be able to investigate the distress? It
has to endure the distress, because the mind is already a fighter and an
endurer.
<!--l. 66647--><p class="indent" >   So. However great or little the distress, fix your attention on that spot. Don&#8217;t set
up any desires for it to disappear. Simply know the truth of the feeling as it arises
and changes. Know right there and know its every phase, heavy or light, great or
little, until it finally disappears.
<!--l. 66653--><p class="indent" >   And when the feeling of distress dissolves away from the heart through your
focused investigation, know what feeling arises in its place. Keep knowing step
by step. Only then can you be called an investigator. Don&#8217;t hold fast to
any feelings &#8212; whether of pleasure or of equanimity. Know that they too
are feelings and are individual conditions, separate from the mind &#8212; and
so they can change. This one comes in, that one dissolves away, this one
takes its place: They keep at it like this, in line with the common nature of
feelings, because the seeds are constantly in the heart, enabling these three
kinds of feelings to appear. Once the mind has absolutely no more seeds of
any sort, no feelings or moods of any sort will appear in the mind at all,
aside from &#8217;paramam sukham&#8217; &#8212; the ultimate ease that&#8217;s part of the nature
of a pure heart. This doesn&#8217;t count as a feeling. When the Buddha says,
&#8217;nibbanam paramam sukham&#8217; &#8212; nibbana is the ultimate ease &#8212; that&#8217;s not a
feeling of ease, stress, or equanimity, and so it&#8217;s not subject to arising and
disappearing.
<!--l. 66671--><p class="indent" >   When focusing your investigation on all three of these feelings, take the feelings
themselves as your battleground. Focus on watching them carefully and in full detail.
Keep watching each one as long as it hasn&#8217;t yet disappeared. Watch it again.
Keep watching until you know its truth. Whether or not it disappears isn&#8217;t
important. What&#8217;s important is that you know the truth of this feeling &#8212; the one
appearing in the present. This is called contemplating feeling as a foundation of
mindfulness.
<!--l. 66680--><p class="indent" >   Usually this refers to feelings of distress or pain, because these are the ones that
are most striking and unsettling to the heart. As for feelings of pleasure, they&#8217;re a
way-station for the mind. You could say that they help us, or that they are the
results that come from investigating feelings of distress until the distress disappears
and pleasure appears. This is one of the results that comes from investigating feelings
of distress or pain.
<!--l. 66688--><p class="indent" >   As for whether or not we should do away with feelings of pleasure, as far as I&#8217;ve
noticed I&#8217;ve never seen them being eliminated. Feelings of pain or distress are the
important ones within the mind. They arise from the seeds of defilement. Once these
seeds are lessened step by step, the feelings of mental pain become more

and more refined, more and more refined. They gradually fade away until
they disappear without leaving a trace in the mind, because the seeds are
gone.
<!--l. 66696--><p class="indent" >   When these seeds are gone, that type of pleasurable feeling also disappears. It
disappears because it relies on those seeds to arise. Thus we can say that the feelings
of pleasure that arise in the heart from practice, or from the basis of the mind &#8212; the
stillness of the mind, the radiance of the mind &#8212; qualify as &#8217;vihara-dhamma,&#8217;
dwelling places for the mind, way-stations for the mind on its journey. Or we could
say that they&#8217;re the results that come from investigating feelings of pain. Whether or
not we investigate this pleasure is not as important as investigating feelings
of pain and their causes &#8212; which are very important, because they are in
a direct sense the origin of stress. They give rise to stress as their direct
result.
<!--l. 66708--><p class="indent" >   In the context of the four Noble Truths, the Buddha teaches us to diagnose stress,
but why doesn&#8217;t he teach us to diagnose pleasure? What does pleasure come from?
He doesn&#8217;t say &#8212; because it arises from the path doing its duty until the cause of
stress disintegrates and pleasure arises in its stead.
<!--l. 66714--><p class="indent" >   Now when the stress that&#8217;s part and parcel of defilement disappears, this type of
pleasure disappears as well, but another kind of pleasure or ease appears along with
the heart that has been purified &#8212; and this doesn&#8217;t disappear with anything at
all.
<!--l. 66719--><p class="indent" >   Now as for concentration: When you&#8217;re going to make the mind still, you really
have to make it stay with its theme of tranquillity meditation. Don&#8217;t go concerning
yourself with the topics you&#8217;ve been investigating, because the mind has to rest. You
can&#8217;t not let it rest. When the time comes to rest, it needs rest. No matter how great
the results and accomplishments you get from your practice of investigation,
the heart can still grow tired and weary. Your work &#8212; your thinking and
pondering in the area of discernment or whatever &#8212; is all work for the mind.
When the mind has been thinking, pondering, and investigating for a long
time, it can grow weary and so it has to rest. When the time comes to rest,
you shouldn&#8217;t involve yourself with any work at all. Set your mind solely
on performing your duties for the sake of mental stillness. This is called
working without overstepping your boundaries; without being worried about
what went before or will come after; without overflowing your banks. The
heart will then have the strength to continue its work with clear insight and
discernment.
<!--l. 66736--><p class="indent" >   When you want stillness of mind so as to provide strength for discernment, you
should set your mind on the theme that will make the mind still and then stick right
with it until the mind is still, right then and there. Once the mind has been still long
enough to gain strength, you can then withdraw from that stillness. Now you start
probing. You don&#8217;t have to concern yourself with stillness. Your duty is to
investigate step by step. This is called the correct way &#8212; the appropriate way, the
uniform way &#8212; to follow the path of tranquillity and insight all the way to the
goal.
<!--l. 66746--><p class="indent" >   All of these are problems I&#8217;ve been through myself. When I would get engrossed
in something, I&#8217;d be so stuck that I&#8217;d get addicted and heedless. I&#8217;d get addicted to

the stillness, the sense of comfort and ease in concentration. When I&#8217;d get engrossed
in investigating, I&#8217;d be so engrossed that I&#8217;d forget myself and wouldn&#8217;t let the mind
rest at all. Neither of these ways is correct. In other words, neither is in keeping with
what is just right.
<!--l. 66754--><p class="indent" >   The right way is that when the mind feels tired and weary from its work, we have
to let it rest in stillness. When the time comes to investigate, we have to investigate.
We can&#8217;t worry about anything else. We have to set our mind on our duties, step by
step, in keeping with the job at hand. This is always the appropriate way to proceed
with tranquillity and insight.
<!--l. 66761--><p class="indent" >   There is no job in the world bigger than the job of removing defilement, of
removing oneself from the cycle of wheeling around from birth to death for
countless lifetimes. When we think about it, it&#8217;s really dismaying &#8212; circling
around from birth to death, carrying a load of nothing but suffering and
stress. No matter what the level, the only difference is that the stress is
less or more, because all levels have stress inasmuch as they contain the
defilements that give rise to stress. So how can they not have stress? All living
beings have to suffer stress. The Buddha thus taught us to rid ourselves of all
defilement until there is nothing left hidden in the mind. Let there simply be
the &#8217;pure meat.&#8217; Don&#8217;t let there be any bones, or they&#8217;ll be bad for your
health.
<!--l. 66774--><p class="indent" >   Defilements, no matter what the sort, need to be cleansed away, peeled away until
nothing is left. This is why it&#8217;s called a very big job. There are times when we have to
give it our all &#8212; all our skill, all our mindfulness and discernment, even our life &#8212; to
an extent that we will never forget.
<!--l. 66780--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;So. If we&#8217;re going to die, then let&#8217;s die. If not, then let&#8217;s know it.&#8217; That&#8217;s
all there is. There can be nothing else. This is when the mind is its own
mainstay. Atta hi attano natho: It can take care of itself. In other words, we
leave it to the mind&#8217;s own strength. When the mind is whirling in for the
sake of the realm beyond suffering, as if nibbana were always just coming
into reach; while what&#8217;s behind us keeps pressing in, and we realize more
and more its danger and harm, there&#8217;s only one way to escape the Great
Danger:
<!--l. 66789--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;If we&#8217;re going to die, then let&#8217;s die. If not, then let&#8217;s know the Dhamma.&#8217;
Wherever we are, we don&#8217;t want to stay. Wherever we&#8217;re stuck, we don&#8217;t want to be
stuck. It&#8217;s a waste of our time in gaining release from suffering. We&#8217;ve simply got to
reach release from suffering. This is the only thing that can satisfy such a mind at
such times. When the mind is this way, where is it going to find any weakness or
laziness? If things get tough, we fight. If they&#8217;re easy, we fight. If we&#8217;re going to die,
we still fight until we have no more breath to breathe &#8212; and that&#8217;s when the mind
finally stays put. It can&#8217;t possibly be moved. Once it knows and reaches
the goal, it stays put on its own. No matter where you chase it, it won&#8217;t
go.
<!--l. 66801--><p class="indent" >   Discernment &#8212; which has been spinning itself in circles even more than a wheel
&#8212; when the time comes, stops on its own. It simply runs out of duties of its own
accord, without our having to turn it off, the way we do with motors. This automatic
mindfulness and discernment simply stops or turns off on its own &#8212; because it

already knows, so what else is there to investigate? It has already let go, so what else
is there to let go? It already knows, so what else is there to know? It has
had enough, so where else is it going to look for enough? It knows all of
this within itself. It knows in an instant and is released. In other words, it
knows for the last time. This is where the big job is finished. The job is
big, and the results are enormous. Nothing in any of the three worlds can
compare.
<!--l. 66815--><p class="indent" >   The results of this big job, this heavy job, you know, excel the world &#8212; and how
could we say that ultimate ease doesn&#8217;t excel the world? When excellence stands out,
filling the heart, it&#8217;s far different from defilement standing out, filling the heart.
Whoever wants to know has to practice for him or herself. No one else can do it for
us. When we reach the level of excellence, we excel exclusively within, without
disturbing anyone else.
<!--l. 66823--><p class="indent" >   This Dhamma is always timeless (akaliko). It has been the guarantor of the paths,
fruitions, and nibbana from the time of the Buddha to the present. No one will ever
be able to erase it. The Buddha excelled the world because of this Dhamma. The
arahant disciples whom we revere as our refuge all excelled because of this Dhamma
of purity &#8212; and because of this heavy job. When our Teacher has led us to proceed
in this way, what business do we have shilly-shallying around? We can&#8217;t act
only in line with our preferences, because our Teacher didn&#8217;t lead us in that
way.
<!--l. 66833--><p class="indent" >   Our foremost Teacher was a genius, an utterly genuine person, unequaled by
anyone. But we&#8217;re a bunch of show-offs, doing only what our Teacher criticized, and
so we keep meeting only with things worth criticizing. Don&#8217;t we ever think of
changing, or do we feel we&#8217;re being stylish and up-to-date?
<!--l. 66839--><p class="indent" >   Actually, the path to cure defilement has to be difficult. The path to accumulate
defilement is easy &#8212; because our preferences fool us into thinking it&#8217;s easy. (Notice:
They fool us into thinking it&#8217;s easy.) Actually, both paths are hard. Whatever the
job, the important point is which job we prefer. We&#8217;ll see that job as easy. Light.
Comfortable.
<!--l. 66845--><p class="indent" >   At first, when we were starting out with the job of curing defilement, we weren&#8217;t
getting anywhere at all. Even though we were set on curing defilement, the work was
heavy and we were weak and lazy. Everything bad and worthless was gathered right
there. But now that we gradually come to comprehend causes and effects, and to
understand the Dhamma, the results have begun to appear. Where has our laziness
gone? All that&#8217;s left is diligence and persistence. We can contend with anything,
heavy or light &#8212; we can contend with death &#8212; because we have begun seeing results.
Even though we have been curing defilement all along, the difference is that at one
stage we don&#8217;t see results, and at another we do &#8212; and persistence really
arises.
<!--l. 66858--><p class="indent" >   So. If things get heavy, we fight. We&#8217;re disciples of the Tathagata and so we have
to follow in our Teacher&#8217;s footsteps. Our Teacher met with difficulties, so his disciples
will have to meet with difficulties. Our Teacher passed out two or three times. Is
there anyone among us who has passed out from the effort of the practice? I don&#8217;t see
anyone who has. So why are we afraid of dying when we&#8217;ve never even passed out?
How can we be so stubborn in our fear of death? The Lord Buddha lost consciousness

three or four times. What do we have to say to that? When we lose consciousness,
it&#8217;s because we are falling asleep. Why aren&#8217;t we afraid of dying then? So
why are we afraid of dying when we practice meditation? Exactly what
dies?
<!--l. 66870--><p class="indent" >   When we have explored and seen the truth, we won&#8217;t fear death &#8212; because
nothing in the world dies. All there is, is the mind making its assumptions. It
deceives itself &#8212; &#8217;I&#8217;m afraid of dying, I&#8217;m afraid of dying&#8217; &#8212; but when it knows the
truth of everything of every sort, it&#8217;s not afraid. It&#8217;s not afraid of death. It&#8217;s not
afraid of birth &#8212; because it has nothing left to be born. So what is there to fear?
Why bother with these empty, hollow fears? The mind is now released from birth, so
why be afraid of birth? There are no more seeds for the birth of a body, a man, or a
woman. There is nothing to fear, nothing to be brave about. The mind is even with
itself &#8212; uniform, unchanging &#8212; not &#8217;even&#8217; in the ordinary sense of &#8217;coming out even.&#8217;
It&#8217;s &#8217;even&#8217; in the sense of a mind that has reached sufficiency: &#8217;even&#8217; in its
excellence.
<!--l. 66885--><p class="indent" >   Here I&#8217;ve been talking about a heavy task, but also about the results as a means
of encouragement, as a means of giving the mind something to hold to. The results
are superlative, in keeping with the difficulties and hardships of the practice. What
do we want in our lives? We all want what is good. Even in external things we want
what is good, so especially in the area of the Dhamma, why shouldn&#8217;t we want what
is good?
<!--l. 66893--><p class="indent" >   Then step up your efforts. What does it matter if the cemeteries cry because they
miss you? You have been crying over the cemeteries, so what&#8217;s wrong with letting the
cemeteries cry in turn? They have no more hopes now. You aren&#8217;t coming back
to be born or die. The cemeteries&#8217; being without hope is better than your
being without hope, because there&#8217;s nothing good about birth and death,
circling around, back and forth, with nothing but suffering and stress every
lifetime.
<!--l. 66901--><p class="indent" >   So work out solutions &#8212; and make them succeed. Whatever things are thorns in
the heart, use mindfulness and discernment to explore, to probe on down and remove
them completely so that they&#8217;re all gone. Once they&#8217;re all gone, that&#8217;s the result of
your work. We&#8217;ve talked about how hard the work is: What are the results like? Are
they worth it? Find out for yourself &#8212; and then you are free to live wherever you
like. The Buddha says,
<!--l. 66909--><p class="indent" >   vusitam brahmacariyam:
<!--l. 66911--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;The holy life is fulfilled, the task of the religion is done.&#8217; This is now completely
apparent in every way. Whatever is stressful is a matter of defilement. When the
cause &#8212; defilement &#8212; is ended, the result &#8212; stress &#8212; is ended as well. That&#8217;s all
there is. From then on there is nothing but ultimate ease, which nothing will ever
again come to disturb throughout eternity.
<!--l. 66918--><p class="indent" >   At the End of One&#8217;s Rope
<!--l. 66920--><p class="indent" >   Wherever there&#8217;s the religion, it&#8217;s cool and peaceful. Wherever a person practicing
the religion is lacking, it&#8217;s hot and troubled. If there&#8217;s no religion, the heart is as hot
as fire. Whenever there&#8217;s the religion &#8212; mindfulness and discernment &#8212;
investigating, looking after the heart, the heart is cool.
<!--l. 66926--><p class="indent" >   When we first begin suppressing the rebels in the heart, we suffer &#8212; because for

the most part we&#8217;re defeated by them &#8212; but at least we still have the strength to
fight with them. Even though we may lose out to them sometimes, it&#8217;s better than
groveling before them in abject surrender with no way of putting up a fight at
all.
<!--l. 66932--><p class="indent" >   The practice in the area of the mind falls into stages &#8212; and there are
bound to be stages where it&#8217;s complicated and difficult. Especially at the
beginning: It&#8217;s difficult in that we can&#8217;t see beginnings or ends, causes or
effects. We don&#8217;t understand anything at all. When we take the rudiments of
Dhamma we have gained from the texts or our teachers and put them into
practice, sometimes right, sometimes wrong, this is when it&#8217;s very difficult.
The desire to know and see is very strong, but the heart isn&#8217;t willing to
comply.
<!--l. 66941--><p class="indent" >   This is one kind of anxiety I&#8217;ve been through myself. It overflowed the heart. To
put it simply, it was as if the desire to see and know the Dhamma in the heart was
ready to overflow its banks. But when practicing, the heart didn&#8217;t comply with the
desire to know and see &#8212; and that had me upset and disappointed. Sometimes I&#8217;d be
sitting and the tears would flow because of my self-recriminations: &#8217;You don&#8217;t have
any potential to speak of. You&#8217;ve ordained simply to be a dead weight on the
religion. Here you are sitting in meditation and can&#8217;t find a way in or a
way out. You&#8217;re just sitting buried in a heap of suffering.&#8217; The mind would
think in all sorts of ways out of self-pity &#8212; that I was a hopeless case, that
I didn&#8217;t have any potential to speak of, didn&#8217;t have the potential for the
extraordinary levels of Dhamma, didn&#8217;t have any potential at all &#8212; total
confusion!
<!--l. 66956--><p class="indent" >   Actually, my practice wasn&#8217;t yet right. I was aiming at the results &#8212; the income
&#8212; without paying attention to whether I was doing the work right or wrong. The
desire was strong, but when it wasn&#8217;t fulfilled, it caused suffering. Had I paid some
attention to whether my practice was right or wrong, I might have come to my senses
enough to have evaluated things, to have abandoned some of my bullheaded
attachments, or to have cut back on my desires so that the suffering would have
become lighter.
<!--l. 66965--><p class="indent" >   But whenever I&#8217;d meditate, whatever I&#8217;d focus on, all I wanted was to know and
see the paths, the fruitions, and nibbana in line with what I imagined them to be &#8212;
heaven was like this, the Brahma worlds were like that, nibbana was like this. I&#8217;d
imagine. Speculate. The desire was fierce. I wanted to know, to see, to gain
release from suffering, but my practice wasn&#8217;t making any headway. All
there was, was simple desire: I would simply sit wanting, lie down wanting,
walk wanting, stand wanting. I&#8217;d sit in meditation &#8212; wanting &#8212; but the
mind wasn&#8217;t working at its meditation. It just wanted. I&#8217;d be doing walking
meditation, but the mind simply wanted &#8212; so much so that I&#8217;d forget what I
was doing. I wasn&#8217;t getting any results because there weren&#8217;t enough of
the causes that would bring about the things I aimed for, so how could I
have reached the goal I aimed for? This is something I&#8217;ve been through.
The work of meditation struck me as being more difficult than any other
work.
<!--l. 66982--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;d be meditating, &#8217;buddho, buddho, buddho,&#8217; but the desire would always be

getting in the way &#8212; because I wanted to know, I wanted the mind to be like this or
that, and so I&#8217;d get engrossed in my desires and forget my work of meditation until I
didn&#8217;t know where &#8217;buddho&#8217; had gone. As a result, I didn&#8217;t get anywhere at all. I was
constantly feeling dreary and disappointed. This is the way things always were in the
heart.
<!--l. 66990--><p class="indent" >   But even so, this wasn&#8217;t anything compared to the stage at which the mind
regressed. When the mind regresses, it&#8217;s really upsetting because you used to see
results. You used to gain a sense of ease, mental stillness, and peace appearing clearly
as a solid foundation in the heart, but now it&#8217;s deteriorated. This makes
the heart really agitated &#8212; so much so that there is nothing to hold it in
check. Luckily, though, in spite of my agitation, I didn&#8217;t retreat. I was simply
determined to see things through. I wasn&#8217;t willing to retreat or to slacken my
efforts.
<!--l. 67000--><p class="indent" >   The reason why the mind regressed and couldn&#8217;t make a comeback was the same
sort of thing: desire, nothing mysterious. The mind wanted to know and see as it had
before, but its work wasn&#8217;t coordinated or continuous. All there was, was desire. No
matter how much you desire, it doesn&#8217;t give any results, because that would go
against the principle of causality. If you don&#8217;t make the causes as complete as they
should be, how can you expect to know as you want? You can&#8217;t. Sitting, I&#8217;d be
agitated. Lying down, I&#8217;d be agitated. I&#8217;d go into the forest, into the mountains,
when the mind had regressed, and nothing was any good at all. I couldn&#8217;t figure it
out.
<!--l. 67011--><p class="indent" >   Of the anxieties I&#8217;ve felt in my life as a monk, the anxiety I felt during that
period was the worst. I was agitated because of my desire to attain. I was upset
because the mind had regressed and nothing I could do would bring it back. At first
it had regressed just a little bit and then it kept regressing, regressing until it was all
gone. Nothing was left, not one red cent. It was as if I had never meditated at
all.
<!--l. 67019--><p class="indent" >   When I&#8217;d sit in this state, I was as agitated as if I were on fire &#8212; because of the
desire. The disappointment that my attainments had floated away and disappeared,
plus the desire to get them back: These two things came thronging in at the same
time and so were really strong. Wherever I stayed was unsatisfactory and no help at
all. Even though I was suffering, I would simply keep suffering. I didn&#8217;t know any way
out. Even though I wanted, I would simply keep wanting. I didn&#8217;t know how to get
my concentration back. All there was, was desire &#8212; regret for the things that had
once appeared to my surprise and amazement but now were gone. There was
nothing but disappointment filling the heart, nothing but simple desire, and
it couldn&#8217;t bring back the Dhamma that had disappeared. Finally I came
to feel despair &#8212; for everything. This was when the mind gave up on its
desire.
<!--l. 67034--><p class="indent" >   As for the results I had wanted, well, I had wanted them for a long time. As for
the suffering, I had suffered immensely because of the desires, but hadn&#8217;t
gained anything from them. So now I wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with
them. I&#8217;d throw them all out. If I was going to know, I&#8217;d know. If not, so be
it. All I was after was &#8217;buddho.&#8217; Whatever the mind was going to think, I
wouldn&#8217;t be willing to let mindfulness lapse. &#8217;Get with it, then. Can it really be

that I&#8217;m not going to know? Whatever&#8217;s going to happen, I&#8217;m ready for
it.&#8217;
<!--l. 67043--><p class="indent" >   As soon as I gave up on my desires, they were no longer so fierce, and so the
suffering gradually lessened. I set my mind on my work. Wherever I was, I&#8217;d keep
repeating, &#8217;buddho, buddho, buddho.&#8217; It had always been a trait with me to be
earnest: Whatever I&#8217;d do, I would really do it and wouldn&#8217;t just play around. Now I
got to see this trait in action. I didn&#8217;t let up in my repetition of &#8217;buddho.&#8217; Whether
walking or doing my chores, I wouldn&#8217;t be willing to let it lapse. I&#8217;d keep making the
effort. While sweeping the monastery compound, I would try to keep up my guard
&#8212; until the mind let its work lapse for a moment. I was alert to the fact,
and the mind got right back to work. &#8217;There. Now that&#8217;s the way it should
be.&#8217;
<!--l. 67055--><p class="indent" >   After giving up its desires, the mind was no longer involved with the past. It
stayed in the circle of the present and would do nothing but repeat or meditate on
&#8217;buddho.&#8217; Whether or not it would get any results would depend on what &#8217;buddho&#8217;
would grant. Finally the mind became still, and &#8217;buddho&#8217; was no longer
necessary, so I could let go of the meditation word at that moment &#8212; and
at that point the mind was willing to settle down. Before, it hadn&#8217;t been
willing.
<!--l. 67064--><p class="indent" >   When the mind had settled down in stillness, there was no need to repeat the
word &#8217;buddho.&#8217; All that remained was simple awareness &#8212; clear and conspicuous &#8212;
so the mind stayed with that simple awareness. As soon as it withdrew, I
would start pumping &#8217;buddho&#8217; back in. I had no hopes, because I had already
hoped in the past. I had no hopes for what would happen, no hopes for what
the results would be. I had already hoped in the past, and it hadn&#8217;t given
me any decent results at all. I had seen the harm of hopes &#8212; the sort of
hollow, unreasonable hopes that won&#8217;t do the work and look only for the
results.
<!--l. 67075--><p class="indent" >   So, now I was going to do nothing but work, nothing but work: repeating
&#8217;buddho&#8217; without letting up even for a moment. Once the mind had received proper
nourishment and care, it became still &#8212; gradually more and more still, more
and more steady, until it reached the level it had been before it had visibly
regressed.
<!--l. 67081--><p class="indent" >   What was strange was that when it reached its old level, I still abandoned my
hopes. &#8217;If it&#8217;s going to regress, let it regress. I&#8217;ve had enough of trying to resist it by
using desire, which hasn&#8217;t served any purpose, not the least little bit. So, however the
mind is going to regress, let it regress, but I won&#8217;t abandon "buddho." I&#8217;m always
going to keep at it.&#8217;
<!--l. 67088--><p class="indent" >   When it reached the day when it would normally regress, it didn&#8217;t regress! That
made me a lot more sure of the causes. So I stepped up the causes &#8212; the repetition
of &#8217;buddho&#8217; &#8212; even more, without stopping. I would stop only when the mind
gathered in stillness. The mind became progressively more and more firm. Wherever
I&#8217;d sit, it would be bright. Light. Completely clear. I was sure of myself: &#8217;Now it&#8217;s not
going to regress.&#8217; After one day, two days, one month, two months, it still didn&#8217;t
regress.
<!--l. 67097--><p class="indent" >   Before, the mind would regress after two or three days. After two or three days

it would come down with a crash, with nothing left to show for itself. I&#8217;d
have to keep trying to care for it for 14 or 15 days before it would reach its
old level, and once it got there it would stay just a day or two and then
collapse in a flash, with nothing left at all. All that was left was dreariness and
disappointment.
<!--l. 67104--><p class="indent" >   Now: &#8217;If it&#8217;s going to regress, let it regress. I&#8217;ve hoped in the past, and it hasn&#8217;t
served any purpose. All I&#8217;m after is this, just this one thing: "buddho."&#8217;
<!--l. 67108--><p class="indent" >   (Speaking of the suffering when the mind regresses, you really feel a lot of
anguish, so much so that you&#8217;re ready to surrender. But I was lucky in one way, that
the mind didn&#8217;t retreat. It was determined to see things through, which was why I
was able to bear with it, able to stay. Had the mind become discouraged &#8212; &#8217;It&#8217;d be
better to stop&#8217; &#8212; that would have been the end of me. There would have been
nothing more to tell.)
<!--l. 67116--><p class="indent" >   From then on, the mind kept progressing. Month after month, it became
more and more stable, more and more firm. As for my meditation word,
I wasn&#8217;t willing to let up on it. This kept up until the mind was always
prominent.
<!--l. 67121--><p class="indent" >   That was when I let the meditation word go. In other words, the awareness of the
mind was pronounced, and that was enough for the mind to depend on, so there was
no need to rely on any meditation word for further support. The mind fully knew
itself and could sustain itself. At this point I didn&#8217;t have to repeat any meditation
word because the mind was prominent at all times. I would focus right there.
Wherever I went, I focused right there. I knew right there, just as I had focused on
&#8217;buddho.&#8217; It could form a fine foundation for the mind. I was sure of myself
that:
<!--l. 67131--><p class="indent" >   (1) This foundation had become progressively more and more stable until it
was more stable than it had been the first time it had progressed and then
regressed.
<!--l. 67135--><p class="indent" >   (2) As for focusing on awareness, when awareness was fully pronounced, I should
focus on that without let-up, in the same way I had focused on repeating &#8217;buddho&#8217;
until the mind became more and more refined. This was a foundation for the mind on
which I could depend.
<!--l. 67140--><p class="indent" >   From that point on, I really stepped up my efforts. The time I started sitting in
meditation all night until dawn came from this point. I started to sit one night,
focusing on in, focusing on in, and at first the mind had settled down because it was
used to settling down. It settled down easily because it &#8217;had a good foundation.&#8217; I
kept focusing on in, and as long as no enormous pains arose, the meditation went
quietly. But when I withdrew, a number of hours had passed, and a huge pain arose,
to the point where I almost couldn&#8217;t bear it. The mind that had been quiet
was totally overturned. Its &#8217;good foundation&#8217; had collapsed completely. All
that was left was pain filling the body &#8212; but the mind wasn&#8217;t agitated.
Strange!
<!--l. 67152--><p class="indent" >   The body was so pained that it was quivering all over. This was the beginning of
the hand-to-hand combat in which I was to obtain an important approach &#8212; when
really severe pain arose unexpectedly that night. I hadn&#8217;t yet made up my mind to sit
until dawn, you know. I hadn&#8217;t made any resolutions or anything at all. I was simply

sitting in meditation as usual, as usual, but when the pain arose in full force: &#8217;Eh?
What&#8217;s going on here? I&#8217;ll have to tackle this feeling so as to see results tonight!&#8217; So I
made a resolution in that very moment: &#8217;Okay, if the time doesn&#8217;t come to
get up, I won&#8217;t get up. I&#8217;ll fight until the dawn of the new day. Tonight
for once I&#8217;m going to investigate pain so as to understand it clearly and
distinctly. If I don&#8217;t understand it, then even if I die, let me die. Let me
find out. So dig down!&#8217; This is when discernment really began to work in
earnest.
<!--l. 67167--><p class="indent" >   I had never known, never imagined, never dreamed that discernment would
become so sharp when it was at the end of its rope, when it was really cornered with
no way out. Discernment really started spinning away. It went out digging, exploring,
fighting, determined not to withdraw its troops in retreat. When I was at the end of
my rope, discernment arose. This made me realize, &#8217;We human beings aren&#8217;t
fated to be stupid forever. When we&#8217;re at the end of our rope, we&#8217;re sure to
manage to find a way to help ourselves.&#8217; So it was then: When I was cornered,
overwhelmed by severe pain, mindfulness and discernment probed into the
pain.
<!--l. 67178--><p class="indent" >   When pain arises in full force like this, it fills the entire body. At first it started in
hot flashes along the backs of my hands and feet, which wasn&#8217;t much to speak of,
but then when it really flared up into something big, the entire body was
ablaze. All the bones, as they were connected, were fuel feeding the fire
in every part of the body. It was as if the body were going to fall apart
right then and there. The neck bones were going to come apart. Every bone
was going to come apart from its connections. My head was going to fall
off and hit the floor. When it&#8217;s pained, everything is on a par throughout
the body. You don&#8217;t know where to hold it back enough so that you can
breathe, because everywhere there&#8217;s nothing but a mass of fire &#8212; pain in full
force.
<!--l. 67191--><p class="indent" >   When I couldn&#8217;t find a safe spot in which to place the mind, mindfulness and
discernment dug down into the pain, searching for the spot where the pain was
greatest. Wherever the pain was greatest, mindfulness and discernment would
investigate and explore right there by ferreting out the pain so as to see clearly,
&#8217;Where does this feeling come from? Who is pained?&#8217; When they asked each part of
the body, each of them remained in keeping with its nature. The skin was skin, the
flesh was flesh, the tendons were tendons, and so forth. They had been that way from
the day of birth, but they hadn&#8217;t been painful all along from the day of birth in the
same way that they had been flesh and skin from the day of birth. &#8217;The pain has
been arising and vanishing at intervals. It hasn&#8217;t been lasting like these parts of the
body.&#8217;
<!--l. 67204--><p class="indent" >   I focused on down. &#8217;Each part of the body that&#8217;s a physical form is a reality.
Whatever is a reality stays that way. Right now where is the feeling arising? If we say
that all these things are painful, why is there one point where it&#8217;s really severe?&#8217; So I
separated things out. At this point, mindfulness and discernment couldn&#8217;t slip
away anywhere else. They had to run along the areas that hurt, whirling
around themselves, separating the feeling from the body, observing the body,
observing the feeling, and observing the mind: These three are the important

principles.
<!--l. 67214--><p class="indent" >   The mind seemed comfortable. No matter how much pain was arising, the mind
wasn&#8217;t writhing or suffering or anything. But the pain in the body was clearly very
strong. The nature of pain and of whatever defilements we have is that they join
together. Otherwise the mind won&#8217;t be troubled or affected by the physical pain
that&#8217;s really severe at that moment. So discernment kept digging down until the
body, the feeling, and the mind were all clear, each in line with its individual
truth.
<!--l. 67223--><p class="indent" >   The mind was what labeled the feeling as being this or that: This I could see
clearly. As soon as this was really clear in this way, the feeling disappeared in a flash.
At that moment, the body was simply the body in line with its reality. The feeling
was simply a feeling and it disappeared in a flash into the mind. It didn&#8217;t go
anywhere else. As soon as the feeling disappeared into the mind, the mind knew that
the pain had vanished. The pain had vanished as if it had been snapped off and
thrown away.
<!--l. 67232--><p class="indent" >   In addition, the body disappeared from my sense of awareness. At that moment,
the body didn&#8217;t exist in my awareness at all. All that was left was simple awareness,
because there was only one thing &#8212; awareness &#8212; and it was simply aware. That&#8217;s
all. The mind was so refined that you could hardly describe it. It simply knew,
because it was extremely delicate and refined within itself. The body had
completely disappeared. Feelings had disappeared. No physical feelings were left at
all. The body sitting right there in meditation had disappeared from my
awareness.
<!--l. 67242--><p class="indent" >   All that was left was &#8217;simple knowingness,&#8217; without any thoughts being fashioned
about this or that. At that point, the mind wasn&#8217;t forming any thoughts at all. When
it doesn&#8217;t form thoughts, we say that nothing at all makes the slightest move. The
mind is fixed &#8212; firmly fixed in its own solitude. It&#8217;s a mind in its simple form, on the
level of a mind centered in stillness &#8212; but mind you, this doesn&#8217;t mean that there
was no unawareness.
<!--l. 67250--><p class="indent" >   Unawareness had infiltrated right there, because the mind hadn&#8217;t withdrawn from
unawareness. The mind and unawareness were quiet together because unawareness
didn&#8217;t get out to work. When discernment has it surrounded, unawareness shrinks in
and hides out, quiet in the heart, like the sediment in the bottom of a water
jar.
<!--l. 67256--><p class="indent" >   At that point, I began to feel amazed. There was no pain left. The body had
disappeared. Only one thing hadn&#8217;t disappeared: an awareness so refined I couldn&#8217;t
describe it. It simply appeared there. You couldn&#8217;t say anything else about it. The
thing that simply appeared there: That was the great marvel at that moment.
There was no motion in the heart, no rippling, nothing of anything at all. It
stayed fixed and still like that until enough time had elapsed and then it
moved. The mind began to withdraw and rippled &#8212; blip &#8212; and then was
quiet.
<!--l. 67266--><p class="indent" >   This rippling happens on its own, you know. We can&#8217;t intend it. If we intend it,
the mind withdraws. What happens is that the mind has had enough, of its own
accord. When it ripples in a &#8217;blip&#8217; like this, it&#8217;s aware of the fact. As soon as the &#8217;blip&#8217;
appears, it vanishes. After a moment it ripples &#8212; blip &#8212; again, and disappears

in the same instant. Then the rippling gradually becomes more and more
frequent.
<!--l. 67274--><p class="indent" >   When the mind withdraws after having fully settled down to its foundation, it
doesn&#8217;t withdraw all at once. I could clearly see this at that moment. The mind
rippled slightly: A sankhara formed in a &#8217;blip&#8217; and then disappeared before it had
amounted to anything at all. It rippled &#8212; blip &#8212; and disappeared right then and
there. After a moment it rippled &#8212; blip &#8212; again. Gradually it became more and
more frequent until finally I came back to ordinary consciousness, to the ordinary
level of the mind. I was aware of the body, but the pain was still gone. When the
mind came back out, there was still no pain. It was still quiet until time came for the
pain to reappear.
<!--l. 67286--><p class="indent" >   This is where I got my standard and my certainty. I realized that I had arrived at
a basic principle in contending with pain: &#8217;So this is how it is. Pain is actually
something separate. The body is separate. The mind is separate, but because of one
thing &#8212; delusion &#8212; all three converge into one, and the whole mind becomes
delusion, the whole mind is the one deluded. Even though pain may simply arise in
line with its own nature, if we grab hold of it to burn ourselves, it&#8217;s hot &#8212; because
our labeling makes it hot.&#8217;
<!--l. 67296--><p class="indent" >   After a fair while, the pain returned, so I had to tackle it again, without
retreating. I had to dig on down, exploring again as I had explored before, but this
time I couldn&#8217;t use the tactics I had used in investigating and remedying the pain the
last time around. I needed fresh tactics, newly devised by mindfulness and
discernment so as to keep up with events. It was pain just the same, but
the tactics simply had to be pertinent to the moment. I couldn&#8217;t remedy
matters by holding to the old tactics I had used to investigate and know in
the past. They had to be fresh, hot tactics devised in the present to cure
the present. The mind then settled down firmly in stillness as it had done
before.
<!--l. 67308--><p class="indent" >   In that first night, the mind settled down three times, but I had to go through
three bouts of hand-to-hand combat. After the third time, dawn came &#8212; the end of
the final showdown using reason with real mindfulness and discernment. The mind
was audacious, exultant, and had no fear of death. &#8217;However great the pain may be,
that&#8217;s its own ordinary business. As long as we don&#8217;t enter in and load ourselves
down with it, pain has no significance in the heart.&#8217; The mind knew clearly that the
body has no significance in terms of itself, in terms of the feeling, or in terms of us
&#8212; unless the mind gives it a significance and then gathers in the suffering
to burn itself. There&#8217;s nothing else that can come in and make the mind
suffer.
<!--l. 67321--><p class="indent" >   Getting up that morning, I felt audacious in an extraordinary way. I wanted to
tell Venerable Acariya Mun of my knowledge and capabilities. This was because I felt
daring in a way hard to describe. How was it that things could be so marvelous like
this in a way I had never encountered before? Ever since I had begun meditating,
nothing like this had ever happened. The mind had completely cut off all
connection with any objects and had gathered within itself with real courage.
It had gathered by investigating all around itself, which was why it had
calmed itself inwardly like a thoroughbred. When it withdrew, it was still

full of courage, with no fear of death at all, owing to its conviction that, &#8217;I
investigated like this and this when pain arose. The next time it comes, I
won&#8217;t fear it because it&#8217;s the same old pain. It&#8217;s pain with the same old face.
The body is the same old body. Discernment is the same old discernment
we&#8217;ve used before.&#8217; For this reason, the heart felt no fear of death &#8212; so
much so that it felt all sorts of things hard to describe. To put it in worldly
terms, it was like defying someone right to his face, with no fear of pain or
death.
<!--l. 67340--><p class="indent" >   See? When the mind is bold, it&#8217;s bold all the way. Daring all the way. It fights
without retreating. &#8217;Okay, I&#8217;ll take you on.&#8217; To put it simply and frankly, that&#8217;s just
how it feels. When the time comes to die, &#8217;Okay, I&#8217;ll take you on.&#8217; The mind doesn&#8217;t
retreat. &#8217;When the time comes to die, where will death find any pain for us
greater than this? There&#8217;s no such thing. The only pain is the pain in the
khandhas. It can be great or small, but we know it here in the khandhas.
No matter how much or how heavy the pain may be, it can&#8217;t outstrip our
knowledge and capabilities. It can&#8217;t outstrip our mindfulness and discernment.
Mindfulness and discernment are capable of keeping track of it all, as they have
already known and removed it in the past.&#8217; This is what made me feel really
bold.
<!--l. 67353--><p class="indent" >   When the time would come to die, I didn&#8217;t see that there would be any
problem, with mindfulness and discernment all around me like this. If the
time came to die, then let me die. Birth and death come in a pair. You
can&#8217;t separate death from birth so as not to die, because they are equal
truths.
<!--l. 67359--><p class="indent" >   The next time around, I took on the pain again and knew in the same way. I kept
on knowing in the same way and winning every time. Once I had given it all my
strength in that way, there was never a day in which I&#8217;d say, &#8217;Last night I stayed
up in meditation all night until dawn and didn&#8217;t get anything out of it.&#8217;
But any night in which the mind had difficulty investigating and settling
down, I would come out feeling battered all over my body. I&#8217;d be all stiff and
sore.
<!--l. 67367--><p class="indent" >   But as for getting tactics and strength of mind, I&#8217;d get them every time, until I no
longer had any fear of death at all &#8212; and where would I get any fear? Death was
something ordinary. In other words, discernment had analyzed down to &#8217;What dies?&#8217;
Hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, bones: They&#8217;re simply their original element
&#8212; solidity, the earth element. Since when did the earth element ever die?
When they disintegrate, what do they become? If we focus on down, we see
that they return to their original properties. The water element returns
to its original property. The wind and fire elements simply return to their
own original properties. Nothing is annihilated. The elements have simply
come together in a lump, and the mind comes in and animates it &#8212; this
super-deluded one comes in and animates it, that&#8217;s all &#8212; and then carries
the entire burden: &#8217;This is my self.&#8217; It lays its claims: &#8217;This is me. This is
mine.&#8217; And so it rakes in every kind of suffering as if contracting for the
whole mass, using those assumptions simply to burn itself, and nothing
else.

<!--l. 67385--><p class="indent" >   The mind itself is the culprit. The five khandhas aren&#8217;t the culprits. They aren&#8217;t
our enemies or anything. They simply have their own reality, but we make
assumptions and carry then as a burden. This is why there&#8217;s suffering and
stress. We manufacture it ourselves. These things don&#8217;t manufacture it for
us. &#8217;There is nothing that comes and gives us suffering&#8217;: This is how the
mind came to understand things. We are the ones who misconstrue things.
We are the ones who suffer because we misconstrue things. This produces
suffering to burn and trouble the heart. I could clearly see that nothing
dies.
<!--l. 67395--><p class="indent" >   The mind doesn&#8217;t die. It becomes more pronounced. When we fully investigate
the four elements &#8212; earth, water, wind, and fire &#8212; down to their original properties,
the mind becomes even more pronounced and clear. So where is there any death?
What dies? None of these conditions die. The four elements &#8212; earth, water, wind,
and fire: They don&#8217;t die. And as for the mind, how can it die? It becomes more
aware. More pronounced. More conspicuous. This doesn&#8217;t die, so why does it fear
death? We&#8217;ve been fooled all along, fooled for aeons and aeons, for actually nothing
dies.
<!--l. 67405--><p class="indent" >   Now, the word &#8217;fooled&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean that anyone intended to fool us.
We&#8217;ve been fooled simply because of our own delusion &#8212; fooled into fearing
death. Now we see: This is how the world fears death &#8212; from not having
explored down to its truth, from not knowing what dies. Because look: Nothing
dies. Each thing simply has its separate reality. I saw this clearly. The mind
proclaimed itself by its very nature. I saw its marvelousness clearly, every
time.
<!--l. 67414--><p class="indent" >   Even when the pain was as hot as fire in the body and seemed ready to reach the
clouds, it would vanish clear away, with nothing left, due to the power of
mindfulness and discernment; even the body would vanish from my sense
of consciousness and wouldn&#8217;t appear at all. When everything disbanded
completely as the result of my investigation, all that remained was simple
awareness, as if floating in mid-space (although I didn&#8217;t make the comparison at
the moment). It was completely empty, but the awareness knew clearly.
There was only one thing. There was only one strange thing in the world: the
heart.
<!--l. 67424--><p class="indent" >   Earth, water, wind, and fire made no contact with the heart. The heart thus
had no sense of earth, water, wind, fire or any part of the body. All that
remained was a solitary awareness, an awareness not involved with anything at
all &#8212; an amazing awareness, coming from having investigated things with
circumspection and then having withdrawn from them. Clear. Outstanding.
Astounding.
<!--l. 67431--><p class="indent" >   Once the mind can be settled down like this &#8212; for no matter how many days or
nights it may last &#8212; it has no sense of pain, that the body will fall apart, that it
hurts here or aches there: no sense of any of this at all. And what would give it any
sense of this? Time and place don&#8217;t exist in that mental state. This called to mind
how the Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and arahant disciples could enter the
cessation of feeling and perception for seven days at a time. They could
enter for as many days as they liked. If their minds settled down like this

to the extent of not being involved with anything at all, leaving just plain
awareness without any involvement with time or place, then they could sit for
aeons if they liked. Even if the body couldn&#8217;t endure, if it were to break
apart, it would simply do so, without having any impact on this nature at
all.
<!--l. 67445--><p class="indent" >   This was when my mind accepted &#8212; really believed in &#8212; the ability of those
extraordinary people who enter the cessation of feeling and perception for so-and-so
many days. If their minds reached this level without withdrawing back out to
anything outside, then for days or months they wouldn&#8217;t have any perception of
anything at all. Where would there be pain and pleasure in their bodies? There
wouldn&#8217;t be any at all. They wouldn&#8217;t have any sense of the body. They
wouldn&#8217;t have any awareness of feelings. All that would remain would be plain
awareness. They could sit for aeons, if they liked, as long as the mind was like
this.
<!--l. 67456--><p class="indent" >   This made me believe in the stories of the Pacceka Buddhas who entered the
cessation of feeling and perception. So I took this as a confirmation in my mind.
Whoever says I&#8217;m crazy can go ahead and say so. They have mouths; we have ears. If
we want to listen, we can. If we don&#8217;t, we can keep still. We are all free to have our
opinions on this matter and that. No one has a monopoly on knowing and
seeing!
<!--l. 67463--><p class="indent" >   Even though I didn&#8217;t sit for a long time, the state of mind that had grown still to
that extent for a spell of time was enough to serve as confirmation of those who
entered the cessation of feeling and perception for long periods of time, because it
had the same characteristics: not involved with anything at all. The body would
simply be a body. If it were to fall apart, if it couldn&#8217;t last &#8212; after all, the body is
inconstant, stressful, and not-self &#8212; then it would simply fall apart without the
mind&#8217;s being aware.
<!--l. 67472--><p class="indent" >   This is a level attained through mindfulness and discernment. It&#8217;s a level where
discernment fosters concentration. The mind reaches the full extent of concentration
like this because discernment has fully investigated down to causes and effects.
It then gathers with courage and great refinement. Ordinarily, when the
mind filled with just the power of concentration focuses and settles down, it
is simply unmoving and nothing else. It isn&#8217;t as profound and refined as
this. But the mind stilled through the power of discernment is refined each
time. Once we have gone through hand-to-hand combat in this way to the
point where we get results, the mind has to be absolutely quiet, just like
this.
<!--l. 67484--><p class="indent" >   This was the basis, or the starting capital, for my courage; the primary seed for
my firm conviction in the affairs of the mind. No matter how much anything else
might be annihilated, this knowing nature would not be annihilated. I could see
this clearly. I saw it clearly at the point when nothing else was involved in
my sense of awareness. There was simply that single awareness and so it
was very pronounced. I couldn&#8217;t really say whether this was on the level of
concentration or of discernment. When the mind actually was that way, that&#8217;s how it
was.
<!--l. 67494--><p class="indent" >   From that point on I kept at it. I kept investigating out in the area of

discernment, ranging out widely, then circling back in again. As soon as I would
understand, step by step, the mind would let go and circle inward in an
ever-narrowing sphere, investigating the khandhas and elements, separating the
khandhas and elements.
<!--l. 67500--><p class="indent" >   This is where it began to be &#8217;samuccheda-pahana&#8217; &#8212; absolute relinquishment,
arising from the investigation in the period that followed. As long as the investigation
hadn&#8217;t been absolute, it would win out for only a period of time, just enough to serve
as evidence and proof. It still wasn&#8217;t absolute relinquishment. But when
discernment came to a really clear understanding while investigating, then
it pulled out and severed all ties, step by step &#8212; severed things so that
there were no connections left; severed them step by step, leaving just plain
awareness.
<!--l. 67510--><p class="indent" >   The body (rupa) was severed from attachment. Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and
viññana were severed from attachment. Or you could say that the &#8217;heart&#8217; was severed
from &#8217;them.&#8217; Things kept being severed until only awareness was left &#8212; in other
words, the mind with unawareness buried inside it. So I probed on in, smashed things
to bits, slashed them to smithereens with up-to-the-minute mindfulness and
discernment. The mind of unawareness broke apart, and when the mind of
unawareness broke apart, that was all!
<!--l. 67519--><p class="indent" >   That was when I came to know that all of the marvels I have mentioned here were
simply an affair of unawareness. They had simply been a support, a way-station, a
seed that had produced conviction step by step, but after that &#8212; if you were to say
they were good, they were good; but if you&#8217;re aiming at the subtle Dhamma, this
goodness is the goodness of unawareness. It&#8217;s not genuine goodness, not pure
goodness. It&#8217;s goodness mixed with evil, with suffering and stress, because
stress still has a chance to arise. We have to keep slashing in, slashing in
until everything is smithereens in the heart. Whatever is a seed of anything
counterfeit in the heart, wash it away, scrub it away, until nothing is left,
and that&#8217;s all. The entire mind that is assumed to be &#8217;this&#8217; or &#8217;that&#8217; is all
gone.
<!--l. 67532--><p class="indent" >   This is where the mind reaches absolute purity, where it reaches complete freedom
from all conventional realities. That&#8217;s really &#8217;all&#8217;! It&#8217;s astounding. If it weren&#8217;t
astounding, it wouldn&#8217;t be release from stress. This is a Dhamma apart &#8212; a
Dhamma beyond conventions.
<!--l. 67537--><p class="indent" >   Whether what I&#8217;ve described here is difficult or not, consider it for yourselves.
Sometimes I&#8217;d feel ready to pass out. Sometimes I&#8217;d feel as if the entire body were on
fire. When the pain was really fierce, it seemed to fill the entire body. But ultimately
I was able to pass through these things, to resolve them using mindfulness and
discernment.
<!--l. 67544--><p class="indent" >   So if we put them to use, mindfulness and discernment are never at the end of
their rope. We human beings aren&#8217;t fated always to be stupid, you know. When we
come to the end of our rope, we&#8217;re sure to be able to save ourselves. Who should be
willing to go under when we have the mindfulness and discernment to remedy things,
or when there&#8217;s an opening through which we can escape, through which we can force
our way out? Who would willingly be buried to death? We can&#8217;t help but manage to
find a way out.

<!--l. 67553--><p class="indent" >   When the pain is so piled on that we can&#8217;t see any way to cure it other than using
mindfulness and discernment to explore and find a way out, discernment
doesn&#8217;t depend on this person or that. When the time comes for the mind to
investigate when it&#8217;s cornered, it gathers its forces and manages to save
itself.
<!--l. 67559--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha thus taught us to live in &#8217;crucial&#8217; places &#8212; places where we&#8217;re
cornered, at the end of our rope &#8212; where we live simply, so that mindfulness and
discernment can work full steam ahead and see their own capabilities, rather than
simply waiting for help from others. Time and place can help give rise to mindfulness
and discernment. If we live in a scary place, mindfulness is strong. Discernment is
sharp. Whatever we investigate, they are adroit and audacious. If we live in a
comfortable place, we get lazy. We eat a lot and sleep a lot. This is the
way it is with the mind. If we live in ordinary circumstances, we&#8217;re very
lazy, very inert, very apathetic and listless. If we live in places that aren&#8217;t
scary, we become heedless and revert to being complacent, to sleeping like
pigs.
<!--l. 67573--><p class="indent" >   If we live in a scary place, we&#8217;re always alert. When we&#8217;re alert, we&#8217;re always
self-aware, because alertness is what it means to be mindful. Mindfulness appears
within us, always self-aware, always engaged in persistent effort. Whatever makes
contact, we understand because we&#8217;re not complacent, because we&#8217;re always
alert. This is why we&#8217;re taught to live in whatever places are appropriate,
because they can give good encouragement or support to our persistent
effort.
<!--l. 67581--><p class="indent" >   If we have comfortable huts in which to live &#8212; as we have here &#8212; everything
cares for our every need. Food overflows our bowls. We&#8217;re flooded day and night with
fruit juice, soft drinks, cocoa, and coffee. Main course dishes and desserts come
pouring in from every direction. If we lack mindfulness and discernment, we lie
clutching our food, like a pig lying next to its hay and then climbing up to lie on the
chopping block. As for the Dhamma, we have no hope of winning it. Any meditation
monk who is &#8217;clever&#8217; in this way is bound to go under in this way without a
doubt.
<!--l. 67591--><p class="indent" >   To have mindfulness and discernment, we have to think. However much of the
necessities of life we may have, we must find tactics for keeping the mind in shape, to
keep wary and uncomplacent like a deer wary of danger.
<!--l. 67596--><p class="indent" >   In places where you don&#8217;t have to be wary of food like this, the mind goes about
thinking in another way to reform itself. There, where will you get an excess of
anything? Everything is lacking. Insufficient. Some days you get enough alms to eat,
some days you don&#8217;t. &#8217;This way there&#8217;s nothing to be concerned about, because
you&#8217;ve been full and been hungry before. Even if you go without food for one or two
days, you won&#8217;t die.&#8217;
<!--l. 67604--><p class="indent" >   This is how the heart deals with the problem, and so it isn&#8217;t concerned
about food or anything else. If there&#8217;s nothing but rice, you eat rice &#8212; and
you don&#8217;t see that you&#8217;re concerned about it. &#8217;After all, you&#8217;ve come to a
place like this, so what&#8217;s wrong with eating whatever&#8217;s available? Where are
you going to find anything to go with the rice? You&#8217;ve been fed rice ever
since the day you were born, so what&#8217;s wrong with eating just rice? Can

you eat other things without rice? If eating other things is really special,
you&#8217;ve already eaten a lot of them, so why aren&#8217;t you ever full? You&#8217;ve come
looking for the Dhamma, not for food. Why are you so worked up about your
stomach? You&#8217;ve already eaten a lot, and yet nothing special has ever come of it.
You&#8217;re looking for the extraordinary Dhamma, so what business do you
have getting worked up about food? An expert in Dhamma isn&#8217;t an expert
in eating.&#8217; The mind deals with the situation in the flash of an eye, and
the end result is that it isn&#8217;t concerned. This is how a meditation monk
subdues himself &#8212; or in other words, subdues his greed for the necessities of
life.
<!--l. 67622--><p class="indent" >   And as a result of correcting itself in the matter of eating or not eating, the mind
keeps spinning. You sit in meditation without getting tired. With no food in your
stomach, what is there to get drowsy about? If you don&#8217;t eat at all, you&#8217;re not
drowsy at all and can meditate with ease.
<!--l. 67628--><p class="indent" >   This is a tactic in teaching monks to practice the Dhamma &#8217;rukkhamula-senasanam&#8217;
&#8212; under the shade of trees, in the mountains, in the forest, in lonely places where it&#8217;s
scary &#8212; ahara-sappaya, where the food is amenable. &#8217;Amenable&#8217; here means that it
doesn&#8217;t disrupt the body, that it isn&#8217;t harmful or toxic to the body; and that it
doesn&#8217;t disrupt the mind as well. &#8217;Amenable food&#8217; means nothing but rice sometimes,
or just a little food, so that our meditation goes well. It&#8217;s amenable for those intent
on the Dhamma.
<!--l. 67637--><p class="indent" >   But those of us who are intent on nourishing the stomach for the sake of the body
can&#8217;t do this at all. Otherwise we&#8217;ll die &#8212; don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you. Normally if we
eat a lot, with nothing but good dishes to eat, then we sleep like pigs. How
can this be amenable? It&#8217;s amenable for the defilements, not for winning
the Dhamma. It&#8217;s amenable for the affairs of defilements and the affairs of
pigs.
<!--l. 67644--><p class="indent" >   The term &#8217;amenable food&#8217; has to refer to eating in a way that serves a purpose.
To eat just a little serves a purpose: Wherever we sit in meditation, the mind is
really solid. If we&#8217;re involved with concentration, the mind is solid. If we&#8217;re
involved with discernment, it keeps spinning with much more agility than
normal.
<!--l. 67650--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma tends to arise in places where things are lacking, in difficult places
where we&#8217;re cornered, at the end of our rope. It doesn&#8217;t arise where things are
overflowing, where our needs are met. It doesn&#8217;t arise in comfortable places because
we just get complacent. This is the way we tend to be.
<!--l. 67656--><p class="indent" >   The Lord Buddha lived in a royal palace &#8212; for how long? &#8212; and then left it to
take up the homeless life. Who ever suffered more than he? &#8217;Buddha&#8217; &#8212; Awakening
&#8212; tends to arise in situations like that. His disciples came from all sorts of families
&#8212; the families of kings, financiers, landowners &#8212; listen to this &#8212; wealthy
people. When they went out to become &#8217;sons of the Sakyan, sons of the
victorious Buddha,&#8217; how did they live? &#8217;If we&#8217;re going to die, then we die.
We&#8217;re not going to worry or be bothered with anything at all except for the
Dhamma.&#8217; There! They gained the Dhamma in difficult places, just like the
Buddha.
<!--l. 67668--><p class="indent" >   So which way are we going to take? The Buddha has already shown us the way.

The Dhamma arises in that sort of place &#8212; in tight spots where things are difficult.
The Dhamma arises from a heap of suffering. If there&#8217;s no heap of suffering, then
mindfulness and discernment don&#8217;t arise. If we don&#8217;t think, we don&#8217;t gain mindfulness
and discernment. The Dhamma doesn&#8217;t appear. If there&#8217;s a lot of stress,
it&#8217;s a whetstone for discernment, which probes for clear insight into the
affairs of stress. This way we can live through it and come out superlative
people.
<!--l. 67678--><p class="indent" >   So then. Evam.
<!--l. 67680--><p class="indent" >   The Radiant Mind Is Unawareness
<!--l. 67682--><p class="indent" >   Normally the mind is radiant and always ready to make contact with everything
of every sort. Although all phenomena without exception fall under the laws of the
three characteristics &#8212; stress, inconstancy, and not-self &#8212; the true nature of the
mind doesn&#8217;t fall under these laws.
<!--l. 67688--><p class="indent" >   The extent to which the mind does follow these laws is because the things that
fall under these three characteristics come spinning in and become involved with
it, so that it goes spinning along with them. Even then, though, it spins
in a way that doesn&#8217;t disintegrate or fall apart. It spins with the things
that have the power to make it spin, but the natural power of the mind
itself is that it knows and does not die. This deathlessness is something
that lies beyond disintegration. This non-disintegration is something that
lies beyond the three characteristics and the common laws of nature, but
we&#8217;re not aware of it because conventional realities become involved with the
mind and surround it, so that the mind&#8217;s behavior conforms thoroughly to
theirs.
<!--l. 67700--><p class="indent" >   The fact that we&#8217;re unaware that birth and death are things that have always
been with the mind infected by defilement, is because ignorance itself is an affair of
defilement. Birth and death are an affair of defilement. Our own true affair,
the affair that&#8217;s ours pure and simple &#8212; the affair of the mind pure and
simple &#8212; is that we don&#8217;t have the power to be our own true self. We have
been taking all sorts of counterfeit things as our self all along, and so the
mind&#8217;s behavior is not in keeping with its true nature. Its behavior falls
under the sway of the deceits of defilement, which make it worry and fear,
dreading death, dreading everything. Whatever happens &#8212; a little pain, a lot of
pain &#8212; it&#8217;s afraid. If even the least little thing disturbs it, it&#8217;s afraid. As
a result, the mind is filled with worries and fears. Even though fear and
worry aren&#8217;t directly an affair of the mind, they still manage to make it
tremble.
<!--l. 67716--><p class="indent" >   We&#8217;ll see &#8212; when the mind is cleansed so that it is fully pure and nothing can
become involved with it &#8212; that no fear appears in the mind at all. Fear
doesn&#8217;t appear. Courage doesn&#8217;t appear. All that appears is its own nature by
itself, just its own timeless nature. That&#8217;s all. This is the genuine mind.
&#8217;Genuine mind&#8217; here refers only to the purity or the &#8217;saupadisesa-nibbana&#8217; of the
arahants. Nothing else can be called the &#8217;genuine mind&#8217; without reservations or
hesitations. I, for one, would feel embarrassed to use the term for anything else at
all.
<!--l. 67726--><p class="indent" >   The &#8217;original mind&#8217; means the original mind of the round in which the mind finds

itself spinning around and about, as in the Buddha&#8217;s saying, &#8217;Monks, the
original mind is radiant&#8217; &#8212; notice that &#8212; &#8217;but because of the admixture of
defilements&#8217; or &#8217;because of the defilements that come passing through, it becomes
darkened.&#8217;
<!--l. 67733--><p class="indent" >   The original mind here refers to the origin of conventional realities, not to the
origin of purity. The Buddha uses the term &#8217;pabhassaram&#8217; &#8212; &#8217;pabhassaramidam
cittam bhikkhave&#8217; &#8212; which means radiant. It doesn&#8217;t mean pure. The way he
puts it is absolutely right. There is no way you can fault it. Had he said
that the original mind is pure, you could immediately take issue: &#8217;If the
mind is pure, why is it born? Those who have purified their minds are never
reborn. If the mind is already pure, why purify it?&#8217; Right here is where you
could take issue. What reason would there be to purify it? If the mind is
radiant, you can purify it because its radiance is unawareness incarnate, and
nothing else. Meditators will see clearly for themselves the moment the mind
passes from radiance to mental release: Radiance will no longer appear.
Right here is the point where meditators clearly know this, and it&#8217;s the
point that lets them argue &#8212; because the truth has to be found true in the
individual heart. Once a person knows, he or she can&#8217;t help but speak with full
assurance.
<!--l. 67750--><p class="indent" >   Thus the fact that our mind is surrounded, made to fear, to worry, to love, to
hate, or whatever, is caused entirely by the symptoms of conventional reality, the
symptoms of defilement. We have no mental power of our own. We have only the
power of defilement, craving, and mental effluents pushing and pressuring us day and
night while we sit, stand, walk, and lie down. Where are we going to find any
happiness and ease as long as these things, which are constantly changing, keep
provoking the mind to change along with them without our being aware of the
fact?
<!--l. 67760--><p class="indent" >   There can be no ease in this world &#8212; none at all &#8212; until these things can be
completely eradicated from the heart. Until then, we can have no secure ease and
relief in any way. We can only shift and change about, or lean this way and that,
depending on how much we&#8217;re provoked by the things that come and involve us. This
is why the Buddha teaches us to cleanse the mind, which is the same thing as
cleansing ourselves of suffering.
<!--l. 67768--><p class="indent" >   There is no one who has genuinely penetrated the principles of the truth like the
Lord Buddha. Only he can be called &#8217;sayambhu&#8217; &#8212; one who needs no teaching or
training from anyone else. In curing his heart of defilement, he performed the duties
of both student and teacher, all by himself, until he awakened to the level of
the superlative Dhamma, becoming the superlative person, the superlative
Master.
<!--l. 67775--><p class="indent" >   This is not to deny that on the level of concentration &#8212; the development
of mental stillness &#8212; he received training from the two hermits; but that
in itself wasn&#8217;t the way of extrication leading to the level of omniscience
(sabbaññu). By the time he was to attain omniscience, he had left the two
hermits and was striving on his own. He came to know the Dhamma on his
own and to see on his own, without anyone else&#8217;s teaching him. He then
brought that Dhamma to teach the world so that it has known good and evil,

heaven, hell, and nibbana ever since. Had there been no one to teach us,
we of the world would be completely burdened with the mass of fire filling
our hearts and would never see the day when we could put our burdens
down.
<!--l. 67787--><p class="indent" >   This being the case, we should appreciate the worth of the Dhamma that the
Buddha brought to the world after having endured hardships in a way no one else in
the world could have managed.
<!--l. 67791--><p class="indent" >   So now, at present, what is it that covers the heart so that we can&#8217;t find its
radiance and purity, even though each of us wants to find purity. What conceals it?
To answer in terms of natural principles, we should start with the five khandhas. As
for the &#8217;mind of unawareness,&#8217; we can save that for later. Let&#8217;s just start out with
what&#8217;s really obvious &#8212; the five khandhas and their companions: sight, sounds,
smells, tastes, and tactile sensations.
<!--l. 67799--><p class="indent" >   These make contact with the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, and then link up
with the mind, forming the basis for this assumption and that. The mind then takes
the objects that have come passing by and uses them to bind itself, entangle
itself, or encircle itself so that it is completely darkened with love, hate,
anger, and all sorts of other states, all of which come from the things I have
mentioned.
<!--l. 67806--><p class="indent" >   But what lies buried deep is our belief that the khandhas form our self. From time
immemorial, whatever our language, whatever our race &#8212; even when we are common
animals &#8212; we have to believe that these things are us, are ours; that they are a
being, the self of a being, our own self. If we become deities, we believe
that our divine bodies are ours. If we become hungry ghosts or whatever,
the things we dwell in &#8212; gross bodies or refined &#8212; we take to be us or
ours. Even when we become human beings and begin to have some sense of
good and evil, we still have to believe that &#8217;This is us,&#8217; or &#8217;This is ours.&#8217;
Of the five khandhas, the body (rupa) is &#8217;us.&#8217; Vedana, sañña, sankhara,
and viññana are &#8217;us,&#8217; are &#8217;ours.&#8217; These assumptions lie buried deep within
us.
<!--l. 67819--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha thus teaches us to investigate. We investigate these things so as to
see their truth clearly and then to uproot our mistaken assumptions and attachments
that they are the self. We do this for the sake of freedom and for nothing
else.
<!--l. 67824--><p class="indent" >   If we look at these things in their normal state, we might wonder why we should
investigate them. Sights are simply sights; sounds are sounds; smells, smells; tastes,
tastes; tactile sensations are simply natural phenomena as they&#8217;ve always been.
They&#8217;ve never announced that they are our enemies. So why investigate
them?
<!--l. 67830--><p class="indent" >   We investigate them to know the truth of each one of them as it actually is, to
realize our own delusions by means of this investigation and to extricate ourselves
from them through knowledge &#8212; for the fact that the mind lays claim to the
khandhas as its self, as belonging to itself, is because of delusion and nothing
else.
<!--l. 67836--><p class="indent" >   Once we have investigated and clearly understood what these things are, the mind
withdraws inwardly through knowledge, understanding, and discernment, with no

more concern for these things. We investigate whichever khandha is most
prominent. We needn&#8217;t conjecture or speculate about the fact that we haven&#8217;t
contemplated the five khandhas in their entirety, or each khandha in turn.
We needn&#8217;t conjecture at all. All we need to do is to see which khandha is
prominent and merits investigation at the moment &#8212; which khandha we feel best
suited to handle &#8212; and then investigate and explore it so that it becomes
clear.
<!--l. 67847--><p class="indent" >   Take, for instance, the body, whichever aspect of the body is most prominent in
your awareness &#8212; the aspect that has you most interested, that you want most to
investigate. Latch onto that spot and focus on examining it so as to see its truth in
terms of the question, &#8217;What is stress?&#8217;
<!--l. 67853--><p class="indent" >   In the texts we are told that stress (dukkha) means &#8217;unendurability,&#8217; but this
doesn&#8217;t sit well with my own crass tastes, which is why &#8212; one man&#8217;s meat being
another man&#8217;s poison &#8212; I prefer to translate stress as &#8217;a constant squeeze.&#8217; This is
more in keeping with my tastes, which are very crude. For example, the phrase,
&#8217;yampiccham na labhati tampi dukkham,&#8217; is right in line with my translation. In
other words, &#8217;Not attaining what is desired is stress.&#8217; How is it stress? In that it puts
a squeeze on us, or makes us uncomfortable.
<!--l. 67862--><p class="indent" >   If we don&#8217;t get what we want, we&#8217;re uncomfortable. Even if we get what we want
but then lose it, we suffer stress. Stress in this sense fits the translation, &#8217;a squeeze.&#8217;
This squeeze is what&#8217;s meant by stress or unendurability. If it can&#8217;t endure, let it go
its own way. Why mess with it? Actually, no matter which khandha, no matter
which of the three characteristics, the mind is the one at fault for getting
attached, which is why we have to examine the khandhas until we have them
clear.
<!--l. 67871--><p class="indent" >   Whatever aspect of the body, look so as to see it clearly. If we&#8217;re not yet clear
about the filthiness in our &#8217;physical heap,&#8217; we can look at the charnel ground
within us so as to see it clearly. When we&#8217;re told to visit the charnel ground,
this is where we make our visit. Even if we visit a charnel ground outside,
the purpose is to reflect inwardly on the inner charnel ground &#8212; our own
body.
<!--l. 67879--><p class="indent" >   As for the external charnel ground, in the days of the Buddha it was a place
where corpses were scattered all over the place. The dead were hardly ever buried or
cremated as they are today. So the Buddha taught monks to visit the charnel
ground, where old corpses and new were scattered everywhere. He also gave
detailed instructions as to the direction from which to enter, in keeping
with his sharp intelligence as a self-dependent Buddha, the Teacher of the
world. He said to approach from the upwind side and not from the downwind
side. Otherwise the stench of the various corpses would be bad for your
health.
<!--l. 67889--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;When you encounter corpses in this way, how do you feel? Look at the different
types of corpses. How do you feel? Now refer inwardly, to your own body, which is
another corpse.&#8217; This is how he taught the monks to investigate. Once we have an
eyewitness &#8212; ourself &#8212; as to what the corpses in the external charnel ground are
like, we can refer inwardly to the internal charnel ground: ourself again. Once we
have grasped the basic principle, the external charnel ground gradually fades out of

the picture. Instead, we investigate our internal charnel ground so that it becomes
gradually more and more clear. In other words, we see how this body is a well of
filth. Repulsive. Something that constantly has to be washed, bathed, and
cleaned.
<!--l. 67902--><p class="indent" >   Is there anything that, once it has become involved with any part of the body,
remains clean? Even the food we eat, once we consume it, becomes filthy from the
moment it enters the mouth and passes on down. Our clothing is also dirty. It has to
be washed and laundered &#8212; a lot of fuss and bother. The same holds true for our
homes. They constantly have to be cleaned, scrubbed, dusted, and swept. Otherwise
they turn into another charnel ground because of the filth and the smell. Everywhere,
wherever human beings live, has to be cleaned &#8212; because human beings are
filthy. And since our bodies are already filthy, everything that comes into
contact with them becomes filthy. Even food &#8212; delicious, inviting, appealing
food &#8212; once it becomes mixed with the filth in the body, such as saliva,
becomes filthy as well. If you took food of various kinds into your mouth and
then spit it out, there&#8217;d be no way you could take it back in again. It&#8217;d
be too disgusting. Revolting. Why? Because the body is filthy by its very
nature, and so whatever becomes involved with the body becomes filthy as
well.
<!--l. 67920--><p class="indent" >   To contemplate in this way is called investigating the charnel ground, or
investigating the theme of loathsomeness.
<!--l. 67923--><p class="indent" >   So. Focus in on seeing its inherent nature. Look at every facet, in whichever
way comes most naturally to you. When you&#8217;ve examined one spot, your
knowledge gradually seeps into the next spot and the next. If mindfulness
and awareness keep in close connection, discernment can&#8217;t help but go to
work and advance unceasingly. You&#8217;ll feel profoundly moved as you come to
see and know truly, step by step. This is discernment on the first level of
investigation.
<!--l. 67931--><p class="indent" >   Once you&#8217;ve investigated filthiness, you then investigate the process of change in
the body. In other words, filth is in this body. Dry corpses, fresh corpses, raw corpses,
cooked corpses, all kinds of corpses are gathered together in this body, but I&#8217;ve never
heard the place where they are barbecued, roasted, and stewed called a crematorium.
Instead, it&#8217;s called kitchen. But actually, that&#8217;s what it is, a crematorium for animals.
And then they&#8217;re all buried here in this stomach, this grave. We&#8217;re a burial ground
for all kinds of animals &#8212; yes, us! &#8212; if we look at ourselves in all fairness, with
impartiality, because we&#8217;re filled with old corpses and new. Once we have
contemplated in this way, then if we don&#8217;t feel disenchantment, if we don&#8217;t feel
disengagement, what will we feel? &#8212; for that&#8217;s the way the truth actually
is.
<!--l. 67945--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught us to get to the truth, because this is what the truth is. If we
don&#8217;t resist the truth, we will all be able to unshackle ourselves from our attachments
and false assumptions &#8212; from our stupidity and foolishness &#8212; step by step. The
mind will become bright and clear, radiating its brightness with dignity, bravery, and
courage in the face of the truth that comes into contact with it at all times. It will be
content to accept every facet of the truth with fairness and impartiality. Even
though we may not have yet abandoned our attachments absolutely, we can

still find relief in having put them down to at least some extent. We no
longer have to be constantly weighed down with our attachments to the
khandhas to the point where we are always miserable. This is in keeping with
the saying, &#8217;Fools, the heavier their burdens, the more they keep piling on.
Sages, the lighter their burdens, the more they let go &#8212; until nothing is
left.&#8217;
<!--l. 67961--><p class="indent" >   When we investigate in this way, we should examine the process of change in the
khandhas. Every piece, every bit, every part of the body undergoes change. There&#8217;s
no exception, not even for a single hair. Everything undergoes change in the
same way. So which part is us, which part is ours, to which we should be
attached?
<!--l. 67967--><p class="indent" >   The same holds true with the word &#8217;anatta,&#8217; not-self. It drives home even more
firmly the fact that these things don&#8217;t deserve our attachment. &#8217;Anatta&#8217; lies in the
same parts as change &#8212; the very same parts. They&#8217;re anatta, not ours or anyone
else&#8217;s. Each one, each one is simply a natural phenomenon mingled with the others in
line with its own nature, without any concern for who will like it or hate it, latch
onto it or let it go.
<!--l. 67975--><p class="indent" >   But we human beings are light-fingered and quick. Whatever comes our way, we
snatch hold of it, snatch hold of it, with no concern for right or wrong. We&#8217;re more
light-fingered and quick than a hundred monkeys, and yet all of us, all over
the world, like to criticize monkeys for not being able to sit contented and
still. Actually we ourselves can&#8217;t stay contented and still in any position.
We&#8217;re full of restlessness &#8212; unruly, reckless, overflowing our boundaries &#8212;
and yet we never think of criticizing ourselves. The Dhamma taught by the
Buddha is thus like a stick for slapping the hands of this light-fingered, unruly
monkey.
<!--l. 67986--><p class="indent" >   With the three characteristics, anatta among them, he warns us, strikes our
wrists: &#8217;Don&#8217;t reach!&#8217; He slaps us, strikes us: &#8217;Don&#8217;t reach for it as "me" or "mine."&#8217;
The phrase, &#8217;The body is not the self,&#8217; is just like that. &#8217;Don&#8217;t reach for
it. Don&#8217;t latch onto it.&#8217; This is simply so that we will see that it&#8217;s already
not-self. By its nature it&#8217;s not-self. It doesn&#8217;t belong to anyone at all. He&#8217;s
already told us: &#8217;Anatta: It&#8217;s not the self.&#8217; This is how we investigate the
body.
<!--l. 67995--><p class="indent" >   So, now then: Focus on visualizing it as it disintegrates, in whichever way seems
most natural to you. This part decomposes. That part decomposes. This part falls
off. That part falls off. Let yourself become engrossed in watching it, using your own
ingenuity. This falls off, that falls off, until everything has fallen apart &#8212; all
the bones, from the skull on down. Once the skin that enwraps them has
decomposed, the flesh has decomposed, the tendons that hold them together have
decomposed, the bones can&#8217;t help but fall apart, piece by piece, because
they are held together only by tendons. Once the tendons decompose, the
different parts have to fall off piece by piece in a pile on the ground, scattered
all over the place. You can even visualize having vultures, crows, and dogs
come to eat and scatter the parts everywhere. How does the mind feel about
this?
<!--l. 68009--><p class="indent" >   Well then, look at it. Visualize the liquid parts seeping into the earth and

evaporating into the air, then drying away, drying away until they no longer appear.
The solid parts, once they&#8217;ve dried, return to the earth from which they came. Earth
returns to earth, water to water, wind to wind. Penetrate down into any of four
elements &#8212; earth, water, wind, or fire &#8212; because each gives clear evidence of the
Noble Truths.
<!--l. 68017--><p class="indent" >   We don&#8217;t have to think that we&#8217;ve examined earth clearly, but this element or
that element isn&#8217;t clear. We needn&#8217;t think that way at all. If we examine any one of
them until it&#8217;s clear, we will penetrate them all, because earth, water, wind, and fire
are all already open and aboveboard. They appear to our sight. In our body, we
already have water. Wind &#8212; for example, the in-and-out breath &#8212; is already clearly
there, already clear to see. Fire &#8212; the warmth in the body &#8212; is something we
all have here in our bodies. So why don&#8217;t we accept its truth with right
discernment? Once we&#8217;ve investigated it over and over again, we have to accept
it. We can&#8217;t resist the truth, because that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here: We want the
truth.
<!--l. 68030--><p class="indent" >   So keep investigating. Look for the part that&#8217;s &#8217;you&#8217; or &#8217;yours.&#8217; Look
for it! There isn&#8217;t any &#8212; not a one! The whole thing originally belongs to
them: to earth, water, wind, and fire. It originally belongs to the different
elements.
<!--l. 68035--><p class="indent" >   Now, when you look in this manner, the mind can settle down and grow still. At
the same time, these aren&#8217;t preoccupations that will make the mind proud, conceited,
or unruly. Rather, they are themes that calm the heart, which is why the Buddha
taught us to investigate them repeatedly until we understand and become adept at
them.
<!--l. 68041--><p class="indent" >   When the mind sees clearly with its own discernment, it can&#8217;t help but withdraw
into stillness, firmly centered within, letting go of all its cares. This is one level in the
investigation of the khandhas.
<!--l. 68045--><p class="indent" >   Now for the next step: Investigate feelings of pain, especially when you are ill or
have been sitting in meditation for a long time, and severe pain arises. Take it on,
right there. A warrior has to fight when the enemy appears. If there&#8217;s no enemy, how
can you call him a warrior? And what&#8217;s the enemy? Feelings of pain, the enemy
of the heart. When you&#8217;re ill, where does it hurt? There: You have your
enemy. If you&#8217;re a warrior, how can you run away and hide? You have to
fight until you gain knowledge and then use that knowledge to come out
victorious.
<!--l. 68054--><p class="indent" >   So. What does the pain come from? From the time we were born until we first sat
in meditation, it wasn&#8217;t there. Before we first became ill, it didn&#8217;t appear. It appears
only now that we&#8217;re ill. Before that, where was it hiding? If it&#8217;s really &#8217;us,&#8217; our mind
should have been aware of it at all times, so why hasn&#8217;t this kind of pain appeared at
all times? Why is it appearing now? If the pain is &#8217;us,&#8217; then when it vanishes why
doesn&#8217;t the mind vanish with it? If they&#8217;re really one and the same thing,
they have to vanish together. The pain should appear as long as the mind is
aware. If they&#8217;re one and the same thing, the pain shouldn&#8217;t vanish. You have
to look and investigate until this is clear. At the same time, analyze the
body when the pain arises &#8212; when, for example, your legs ache or when
this or that bone hurts. Fix your attention on the bone if the bone is really

hurting.
<!--l. 68068--><p class="indent" >   Is the bone the pain? Ask yourself! And whatever you&#8217;re asking about, focus your
attention right there. Don&#8217;t ask in the abstract or absentmindedly. Ask in a way that
focuses the mind right down to see the truth. Focus steadily right on the pain. Stare
the mind right down on whichever bone you identify with the pain. Look carefully to
see, &#8217;Is this bone the pain?&#8217; Fix your attention there. Really observe with your own
discernment. If this bone is really the pain, then when the pain vanishes,
why doesn&#8217;t the bone vanish with it? If they really are one and the same
thing, then when the pain vanishes, the bone should vanish too. It shouldn&#8217;t
remain.
<!--l. 68079--><p class="indent" >   But look: When the disease goes away, or when we get up from sitting in
meditation, the really severe pain vanishes, the stress vanishes. So if they are one and
the same thing, why doesn&#8217;t the bone vanish as well? This shows that they aren&#8217;t
one and the same. The feeling isn&#8217;t the same as the body. The body isn&#8217;t
the same as the feeling. Similarly, the body and the mind aren&#8217;t one and
the same. Each has its own separate reality. Distinguish them so as to see
them clearly in line with this truth, and you&#8217;ll understand their true nature
through discernment, with no doubts at all. Feeling will appear in its true
nature.
<!--l. 68090--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately, the investigation will come circling in, circling in, circling in to the
mind. The pain will gradually shrink into itself, away from the mind&#8217;s assumptions.
In other words, you will see that the mind is the culprit. The mind is the
instigator. The physical pain will gradually subside and fade away. The body will
simply be there as the body, with the same reality it had before the pain
appeared. And now that the pain has vanished, the flesh, skin, tendon, bone or
whatever part you had identified as the pain will maintain its reality in
the same way. It isn&#8217;t the pain. The body is the body. The feeling is the
feeling. The mind is the mind. Fix your attention on seeing them clearly. Once
the mind has penetrated to the truth, the pain will disappear. This is one
result.
<!--l. 68103--><p class="indent" >   Another result is that even if the pain doesn&#8217;t vanish &#8212; here I&#8217;m referring to the
physical pain &#8212; still it can&#8217;t have any impact on the heart and mind. Ultimately, the
mind is serene, secure, and majestic, there in the midst of the physical pain. No
matter which part of the body you say is pained &#8212; even if it&#8217;s the whole body at
once &#8212; the mind isn&#8217;t disturbed or agitated in any way. It&#8217;s relaxed and at ease
because it has seen with discernment right through the pain appearing at
the moment. This is another sort of result that comes from investigating
pain.
<!--l. 68113--><p class="indent" >   When investigating pain, then the greater the pain, the more important it is that
your mindfulness and discernment not retreat. They have to keep advancing so as to
know the truth. You needn&#8217;t aim at making the pain vanish, because such a desire
would simply enhance the pain and make it more and more severe. Actually, you&#8217;re
making an investigation simply to see the truth. Whether or not the pain
vanishes, know the truth that is the pain or gives rise to the pain by seeing
through it with your own discernment: That&#8217;s enough. Fix your attention
there, and these things will keep appearing and disappearing there in the

khandhas.
<!--l. 68124--><p class="indent" >   The body appears for a certain period and then disintegrates in what we call
death. As for feelings of pain, they appear a hundred times in a single day and then
disappear a hundred times, a thousand times as well. What&#8217;s lasting about them?
This is the kind of truth they are. Get so you clearly know with discernment the
truth of painful feelings as they appear. Don&#8217;t retreat or let the mind wander
adrift.
<!--l. 68131--><p class="indent" >   What is sañña labeling at the moment? Sañña is the important instigator.
As soon as sankhara fashions anything &#8212; blip! &#8212; sañña latches right onto
it and labels it this, labels it that &#8212; stirring things all up. When we talk
about the things that create havoc, provoking this issue and that, we&#8217;re
referring to these characters: sankharas and saññas that label things and stamp
meanings on them. &#8217;This is us. This is ours. This is pain. It hurts right here.
It hurts right there. I&#8217;m afraid of the pain. I&#8217;m afraid to die&#8217; &#8212; afraid of
everything of every sort. These are the characters that fool us into fear,
making the mind apprehensive, making it give up its efforts and lose. Is
it good to lose? Even children playing games have a sense of shame when
they lose, and try to make up their losses. As for meditators who lose out
to defilement, who lose out to pain: If they don&#8217;t feel embarrassed in the
presence of the defilements, the pains and themselves, then they&#8217;re simply too
shameless.
<!--l. 68147--><p class="indent" >   Know that vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana are simply individual
conditions displayed by the mind. They appear and vanish. &#8217;Sañña anatta&#8217;
&#8212; see? They too are not-self, so how can you hold to them? How can you
believe them to be you, to be yours, to be true? Keep track of them so that
you can know them clearly with mindfulness and discernment: audacious,
undaunted, diamond-hearted, decisive in the face of defilement and pain of every
sort.
<!--l. 68155--><p class="indent" >   Sankharas, mental formations: They form &#8212; blip, blip, blip &#8212; in the heart.
The heart ripples for a moment: blip, blip, blip. The moment they arise,
they vanish. So what substance or truth can you find in these saññas and
sankharas?
<!--l. 68160--><p class="indent" >   Viññana, cognizance: As soon as anything comes into contact, this takes note and
vanishes, takes note and vanishes. So ultimately, the khandhas are full of nothing but
appearing and vanishing. There&#8217;s nothing lasting about them that can give us any
real sustenance or nourishment. There&#8217;s not even the least bit of substance to them.
So use your discernment to investigate until you see clearly in this way, and you will
come to see the real Dhamma taught by the Buddha, which has not been otherwise
from time immemorial and by the same token will never be otherwise at
all.
<!--l. 68170--><p class="indent" >   Once we&#8217;ve investigated to this extent, how can the mind not withdraw into
stillness until it is plainly apparent? It has to be still. It has to stand out. The mind&#8217;s
awareness of itself has to be prominent because it has withdrawn inwardly from
having seen the truth of these things. The mind has to be prominent. Pain, no matter
how horribly severe, will dissolve away through investigation, through the mind&#8217;s
having clearly seen its truth. Or if it doesn&#8217;t go away, then the pain and the mind

will each have their own separate reality. The heart will be inwardly majestic.
Undaunted. Unfearing.
<!--l. 68180--><p class="indent" >   When the time comes for death, let it happen. There is no more fear, because
death is entirely a matter of rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana. It&#8217;s not a
matter of the &#8217;knower&#8217; &#8212; the heart &#8212; breaking apart. It&#8217;s not the knower &#8212;
the heart &#8212; that dies. Only those other things die. The mind&#8217;s labels and
assumptions have simply fooled it into fear. If we can catch sight of the fact
that these labels and assumptions are illusions and not worthy of credence,
the mind will withdraw inwardly, no longer believing them, but believing
the truth instead, believing the discernment that has investigated things
thoroughly.
<!--l. 68191--><p class="indent" >   Now, when the mind has investigated time and again, ceaselessly, relentlessly, it
will develop expertise in the affairs of the khandhas. The physical khandha will be
the first to be relinquished through discernment. In the beginning stage of the
investigation, discernment will see through the physical khandha before seeing
through the others and will be able to let it go. From there, the mind will
gradually be able to let go of vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana at the same
time.
<!--l. 68200--><p class="indent" >   To put the matter simply, once discernment sees through them, it lets go. If it has
yet to see through them, it holds on. Once we see through them with discernment, we
let them go &#8212; let them go completely &#8212; because we see that they are simply
ripplings in the mind &#8212; blip, blip, blip &#8212; without any substance at all. A good
thought appears and vanishes. A bad thought appears and vanishes. Whatever kind
of thought appears, it&#8217;s simply a formation and as such it vanishes. If a hundred
formations appear, all hundred of them vanish. There is no permanence to them
substantial enough for us to trust.
<!--l. 68211--><p class="indent" >   So then. What is it that keeps supplying us with these things or keeps forcing
them out on us? What is it that keeps forcing this thing and that out to fool us? This
is where we come to what the Buddha calls the pabhassara-citta: the original, radiant
mind. &#8217;But monks, because of the admixture of defilement,&#8217; or &#8217;because of the
defilements that come passing through&#8217; &#8212; from sights, sound, smells, tastes, tactile
sensations; from rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana, that our labels and
assumptions haul in to burn us &#8212; &#8217;the mind becomes defiled.&#8217; It&#8217;s defiled with just
these very things.
<!--l. 68221--><p class="indent" >   Thus investigation is for the sake of removing these things so as to reveal the
mind through clear discernment. We can then see that as long as the mind is at the
stage where it hasn&#8217;t ventured out to become engaged in any object &#8212; inasmuch as
its instruments, the senses, are still weak and undeveloped &#8212; it is quiet
and radiant, as in the saying, &#8217;The original mind is the radiant mind.&#8217; But
this is the original mind of the round of rebirth &#8212; for example, the mind
of a newborn child whose activities are still too undeveloped to take any
objects on fully. It&#8217;s not the original mind freed from the cycle and fully
pure.
<!--l. 68232--><p class="indent" >   So while we investigate around us stage by stage, the symptoms of defilement that
used to run all over the place will be gathered into this single point, becoming a
radiance within the mind. And this radiance: Even the tools of super-mindfulness

and super-discernment will have to fall for it when they first meet with it,
because it&#8217;s something we have never seen before, never met before, from the
beginning of our practice or from the day of our birth. We thus become awed
and amazed. It seems for the moment that nothing can compare to it in
magnificence.
<!--l. 68242--><p class="indent" >   And why shouldn&#8217;t it be magnificent? It has been the king of the round of rebirth
in all three worlds &#8212; the world of sensuality, the world of form, and the world of
formlessness &#8212; since way back when, for countless aeons. It&#8217;s the one who has
wielded power over the mind and ruled the mind all along. As long as the mind
doesn&#8217;t possess the mindfulness and discernment to pull itself out from under this
power, how can it not be magnificent? This is why it has been able to drive the
mind into experiencing birth on various levels without limit, in dependence
on the fruits of the different actions it has performed under the orders of
the ephemeral defilements. The fact that living beings wander and stray,
taking birth and dying unceasingly, is because this nature leads them to do
so.
<!--l. 68255--><p class="indent" >   This being the case, we have to investigate it so as to see it plainly. Actually,
radiance and defilement are two sides of the same coin because they are both
conventional realities. The radiance that comes from the convergence of the various
defilements will form a point, a center, so that we can clearly perceive that &#8217;This is
the center of the radiance.&#8217; When any defilement appears, in correspondence with
that state or level of the mind, a very refined stress will arise in the center we call
radiant. Thus radiance, defilement, and stress &#8212; all three &#8212; are companions. They
go together.
<!--l. 68265--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, the mind possessing this radiance must worry over it, guard it,
protect it, maintain it, for fear that something may come to disturb it, jar it, obscure
its radiance. Even the most refined adulteration is still an affair of defilement, about
which we as meditators should not be complacent. We must investigate it with
unflagging discernment.
<!--l. 68271--><p class="indent" >   In order to cut through the burden of your concerns once and for all, you
should ask yourself, &#8217;What is this radiance?&#8217; Fix your attention on it until
you know. There&#8217;s no need to fear that once this radiance is destroyed, the
&#8217;real you&#8217; will be destroyed along with it. Focus your investigation right
at that center to see clearly that this radiance has the characteristics of
inconstancy, stress, and not-self just like all the other phenomena you have
already examined. It&#8217;s not different in any way, aside from the difference in its
subtlety.
<!--l. 68280--><p class="indent" >   Thus nothing should be taken for granted. If anything has the nature of
conventional reality, let discernment slash away at it. Focus right down on the mind
itself. All the really counterfeit things lie in the mind. This radiance is the ultimate
counterfeit and at that moment it&#8217;s the most conspicuous point. You hardly want to
touch it at all, because you love it and cherish it more than anything else. In the
entire body there is nothing more outstanding than this radiance, which is why you
are amazed at it, love it, cherish it, dawdle over it, want nothing to touch it. But it&#8217;s
the enemy king: unawareness.
<!--l. 68290--><p class="indent" >   Have you ever seen it? If you haven&#8217;t, then when you reach this stage in your

practice you&#8217;ll fall for it of your own accord. And then you&#8217;ll know it of your own
accord &#8212; no one will have to tell you &#8212; when mindfulness and discernment are
ready. It&#8217;s called avijja &#8212; unawareness. Right here is the true unawareness. Nothing
else is true unawareness. Don&#8217;t go imagining avijja as a tiger, a leopard, a demon, or
a beast. Actually, it&#8217;s the most beautiful, most alluring Miss Universe the world has
ever seen. Genuine unawareness is very different from what we expect it to
be.
<!--l. 68300--><p class="indent" >   When we reach genuine unawareness, we don&#8217;t know what unawareness is
and so we get stuck right there. If there&#8217;s no one to advise us, no one to
suggest an approach, we are sure to stay stuck there a long time before we can
understand and work ourselves free. But if there is someone to suggest an
approach, we can begin to understand it and strike right at that center, without
trusting it, by investigating it in the same way we have dealt with all other
phenomena.
<!--l. 68308--><p class="indent" >   Once we&#8217;ve investigated it with sharp discernment until we know it clearly, this
phenomenon will dissolve away in a completely unexpected way. At the same time,
you could call it Awakening, or closing down the cemeteries of the round of rebirth,
the round of the mind, under the shade of the Bodhi tree. Once this phenomenon has
dissolved away, something even more amazing that has been concealed by
unawareness will be revealed in all its fullness.
<!--l. 68316--><p class="indent" >   This is what is said to be like the quaking of the cosmos within the heart. This is
a very crucial mental moment: when the heart breaks away from conventions. This
moment, when release and conventional reality break away from each other, is more
awesome than can be expressed. The phrase, &#8217;the path of arahantship giving way to
the fruition of arahantship&#8217; refers to precisely this mental moment, the moment in
which unawareness vanishes. As we are taught, when the path is fully developed, it
steps onward to the fruition of arahantship, which is the Dhamma &#8212; the
mind &#8212; at its most complete. From that moment on, there are no more
problems.
<!--l. 68327--><p class="indent" >   The phrase, &#8217;the one nibbana,&#8217;1 is fully realized in this heart in the moment
unawareness is dissolving. We are taught that this is the moment when the path and
the fruition &#8212; which are a pair &#8212; come together and meet. If we were to make a
comparison with climbing the stairs to a house, one foot is on the last step, the other
foot is on the floor of the house. We haven&#8217;t yet reached the house with
both feet. When both feet are on the floor of the house, we&#8217;ve &#8217;reached the
house.&#8217; As for the mind, it is said to reach the Dhamma or to attain the
ultimate Dhamma, and from the moment of attainment it&#8217;s called &#8217;the one
nibbana.&#8217;
<!--l. 68338--><p class="indent" >   In other words, the mind is completely free. It displays no further activity for the
removal of defilement. This is called the one nibbana. If you want, you can call it the
fruition of arahantship, for at this stage there are no more defilements to quibble. Or
you can call it the one nibbana. But if you want to give it the conventional label most
appropriate to the actual principle, so that nothing is deficient in conventional terms,
you have to say &#8217;the one nibbana&#8217; so as to be completely fitting with conventional
reality and release in the final phase of wiping out the cemeteries of the mind of
unawareness.

<!--l. 68348--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught,
<!--l. 68350--><p class="indent" >   n&#8217;atthi santi param sukham:There is no ease other than peace.
<!--l. 68352--><p class="indent" >   This refers to the stage of those who have no more defilements, who have attained
sa-upadisesa-nibbana alive, such as the arahants.
<!--l. 68355--><p class="indent" >   To practice the religion means to attend to your own heart and mind. Who is it
that suffers pain and difficulty? Who is the suspect, forever imprisoned? Who else, if
not the mind? And who has it imprisoned, if not all the defilements and mental
effluents? To deal with the situation, you have to deal directly with the
enemies of the heart, using your discernment, for only sharp discernment is
capable of dealing with the defilements until they dissolve away of their own
accord, as I have already mentioned. From that point on, there are no more
problems.
<!--l. 68365--><p class="indent" >   As for rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana, they&#8217;re simply conditions &#8212;
just conditions &#8212; no longer capable of affecting or provoking the mind.
The same with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations: Each
has its separate reality. To each one we say, &#8217;If it exists, it exists. If not,
no matter.&#8217; The only problem has been the mind that makes labels and
assumptions through its own stupidity. Once it gains enough intelligence,
it becomes real. All phenomena within and without are real. Each has its
own separate reality, with no more of the conflicts or issues that used to
occur.
<!--l. 68376--><p class="indent" >   When we reach the stage where &#8217;each has its own separate reality,&#8217; we can say
that the war between the mind and defilement is over. When the time comes to part,
we part. If not, we live together, like everyone else in the world, but we don&#8217;t take
issue with each other like everyone else in the world, because we&#8217;ve made our
investigation.
<!--l. 68382--><p class="indent" >   If the words &#8217;inconstancy, stress, and not-self&#8217; don&#8217;t refer to the khandhas for
which we are responsible, what do they refer to? So now we have completed our
studies &#8212; our study of the three characteristics (tilakkhana), rather than of the three
divisions (tipitaka) of the Pali canon, although actually the three divisions are
nothing other than the three characteristics, in that the three divisions are a
description of the three characteristics throughout.
<!--l. 68390--><p class="indent" >   Inconstancy: the process of change. Stress. Not-self: The khandhas are not us &#8212;
not us while we are living, so when we die what is there to latch onto? When you see
the truth in this way, you don&#8217;t worry or feel apprehensive over the life or
death of the khandhas. The mind simply perceives the modes in which the
khandhas behave and break apart, but by its nature it doesn&#8217;t disband along
with the khandhas, so there&#8217;s nothing to fear. If death comes, you don&#8217;t
try to prevent it. It life continues, you don&#8217;t try to prevent it, for each is a
truth.
<!--l. 68400--><p class="indent" >   In completing your study of death, you become the ultimate person &#8212; the
ultimate you. When you have completed your study of death, you don&#8217;t fear death &#8212;
&#8217;If life continues, let it continue; if death comes, let it die&#8217; &#8212; for you have spread a
net around yourself with your discernment. You don&#8217;t tremble over the truths of
which the heart is fully aware at all times.
<!--l. 68407--><p class="indent" >   So. That&#8217;s enough for now. As it happens, we&#8217;re at the end of the tape...

<!--l. 68410--><p class="indent" >   An Heir to the Dhamma
<!--l. 68412--><p class="indent" >   A talk given to the monks at Wat Pa Baan Taad.
<!--l. 68414--><p class="indent" >   The ordinary mind &#8212; no matter whose &#8212; when it doesn&#8217;t yet have any standards
and meets up with things that drag it here and there in the wrong directions, will
tend to go rolling after those preoccupations without let-up, to the point where it
can&#8217;t find any foundation for sustaining its peace and calm. In terms of the Dhamma,
these preoccupations are called defilements.
<!--l. 68421--><p class="indent" >   We can see them when we begin to practice: The mind stumbles and crawls along,
not at all willing to follow the Dhamma, because the defilements are strong. This is
something I haven&#8217;t forgotten, from the time I first set out to practice up
until now, because it&#8217;s a truth that lies embedded in the heart. How could I
forget?
<!--l. 68427--><p class="indent" >   From the very start of my practice, I was really in earnest &#8212; because that&#8217;s the
sort of person I was. I wouldn&#8217;t just play around. Wherever I would take my stance,
that&#8217;s how it would have to be. When I set out to practice, I had only one book &#8212;
the Patimokkha &#8212; in my shoulder bag. Now I was going for the full path and the full
results. I was going to give it my all &#8212; give it my life. I wasn&#8217;t going to hope for
anything else. I was going to hope for nothing but release from suffering. I was sure
that I would attain release from suffering in this lifetime. All I asked was
that there be someone who could show me that the paths, fruitions, and
nibbana were for real. I would give my life to that person and to the Dhamma
through the practice, without holding anything back. If I was to die, I&#8217;d die
with the practice. I wouldn&#8217;t die with retreat. My heart was set like a stone
post.
<!--l. 68442--><p class="indent" >   The first rains after I had set out to practice, I spent in Cakkaraad District, Korat
Province, because I hadn&#8217;t been able to catch up with Venerable Acariya Mun. I
began accelerating my efforts as soon as I got there, and it wasn&#8217;t long before my
mind attained stillness, because I was practicing both day and night. I wasn&#8217;t willing
to do any other work aside from the work of concentration practice &#8212; sitting and
walking meditation &#8212; in my own stumbling and crawling way. My mind was able to
quiet down, so I really accelerated my efforts; but then, as I&#8217;ve told you before, it
regressed when I was making a klod.2 Up to that point, I was no mean hand at
concentration. It was really solid. I was sure that the paths, fruitions, and nibbana
were for real, because the mind was really solid. It wasn&#8217;t affected by anything at
all. But even then it still managed to regress just because I made a single
klod.
<!--l. 68457--><p class="indent" >   When I reached Venerable Acariya Mun, he taught me the Dhamma as if it came
straight out of his heart. He would never use the words, &#8217;It seems to be...,&#8217; because it
really came right out of his heart &#8212; how he had practiced, what he had known and
seen. It was as if he kept saying, &#8217;Right here. Right here.&#8217; So did he see or
didn&#8217;t he? Did he know or didn&#8217;t he? &#8217;Right here.&#8217; Where were the paths,
fruitions, and nibbana? &#8217;Right here. Right here.&#8217; My mind was convinced, really
convinced. From that point on I made a resolution: As long as he was still
alive, I wouldn&#8217;t leave him until either he died or I did. As for going off
from time to time to practice on my own, I&#8217;d ask to do that as a matter of
course, but I&#8217;d take him as my base, as if my home were with him. No matter

where I&#8217;d go, I&#8217;d have to return to him. So then I stepped up my efforts full
speed.
<!--l. 68471--><p class="indent" >   That dream I had &#8212; I&#8217;ll never forget it. I&#8217;ve told you all this dream before,
but it had such an impact on me that it bears telling again. I had come to
stay with him and made my resolution with full conviction, with complete
faith in him. There was no point on which you could fault him. Whatever
he did, inwardly or outwardly, was right in line with the principles of the
Dhamma and Vinaya. There was nothing roundabout or evasive about him.
That was why I had made up my mind to stay with him. If he were alive
today, I still wouldn&#8217;t leave him. I&#8217;d have to stay with him, although as a
matter of course I&#8217;d still go here or there from time to time, as I had told
myself.
<!--l. 68482--><p class="indent" >   It was only around the fourth or fifth night after I had gone to stay with him...
this dream, you know, was really amazing. I dreamed that I was fully robed,
carrying my bowl and klod, following an overgrown trail through the jungle.
There were no side paths on either side. Both sides were full of thorns and
brambles. All I could do was to keep trying to follow the trail, which was
just barely a path, all overgrown, just enough to give a hint of where to
go.
<!--l. 68490--><p class="indent" >   Finally I reached a point where a thick clump of bamboo had fallen across the
trail. I couldn&#8217;t see which way to go. There was no way around it on either side. How
was I going to get past it? I peered here and there until finally I saw an opening &#8212; a
tiny opening, right along the path, just enough for me to force my way through
together with my bowl.
<!--l. 68497--><p class="indent" >   Since there was no other way, I removed my outer robe &#8212; that&#8217;s how clear
the dream was, as if I weren&#8217;t dreaming at all &#8212; I removed my outer robe
and folded it away, just as we keep our robes folded here. I removed my
bowl strap from my shoulder and crawled through the opening, dragging my
bowl by its strap and pulling my klod just within reach behind me. I was
able to force my way through, dragging my bowl, my klod and my robe
behind me, but it was really difficult. I kept at it for a long time until finally I
worked my way free. I pulled my bowl, and my bowl came free. I pulled my
klod, and my klod came free. I pulled my robe, and my robe came free. As
soon as I was entirely free, I put on my robe again &#8212; that&#8217;s how clear the
dream was &#8212; I put on my robe, slung my bowl over my shoulder, and told
myself, &#8217;Now I can go on.&#8217; I kept following that trail-it was really overgrown
&#8212; for about another 40 meters, wearing my robe, carrying my bowl and
klod.
<!--l. 68513--><p class="indent" >   Looking ahead, there was wide open space. In front of me was the ocean. Looking
across, there was no further shore. All I could see was the shore on which I was
standing and a tiny island, way out in the distance, a black speck on the edge of the
horizon. I was going to that island. As soon as I walked down to the water&#8217;s edge, a
boat &#8212; I don&#8217;t know where it came from and I didn&#8217;t notice whether it was a
speedboat or a rowboat or whatever &#8212; a boat came up to the shore and I got in. The
boatsman didn&#8217;t say anything to me. As soon as I sat down in the boat and got my
bowl and other things in, the boat sped out to the island, without my having to say a

word. I don&#8217;t know how it happened. It kept speeding, speeding out to the
island. There didn&#8217;t seem to be any dangers or waves or anything at all. We
went silently and in no time at all we arrived &#8212; because, after all, it was a
dream.
<!--l. 68528--><p class="indent" >   As soon as I reached the island, I got my things out of the boat and went ashore.
The boat disappeared completely, without my saying even a word to the boatsman. I
slung my bowl over my shoulder and climbed up the island. I kept climbing until I
saw Venerable Acariya Mun sitting on a small bench, pounding his betel nut
and watching me climb up towards him. &#8217;Maha,&#8217; he said, &#8217;how did you get
here? Since when has anyone come that way? How were you able to make it
here?&#8217;
<!--l. 68536--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;I came by boat.&#8217;
<!--l. 68538--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Oho. That trail is really difficult. Nobody dares risk his life coming that way.
Very well then, now that you&#8217;re here, pound my betel for me.&#8217; He handed me his
betel pounder, and so I pounded away &#8212; chock, chock, chock. After the second or
third chock, I woke up. I felt really disappointed. I wished I could have continued
with the dream to see at least how it ended.
<!--l. 68545--><p class="indent" >   That morning I went to tell my dream to Venerable Acariya Mun. He
interpreted it very well. &#8217;This dream, you know,&#8217; he said, &#8217;is very auspicious.
It shows the pattern for your practice without any deviations. Follow the
practice in the way that you&#8217;ve dreamed. In the beginning, it&#8217;ll be extremely
difficult.&#8217; That&#8217;s what he said. &#8217;You have to give it your best. Don&#8217;t retreat. The
beginning will be difficult. The part where you made it through the clump
of bamboo: That&#8217;s the difficult part. So give it your best. Don&#8217;t you ever
retreat. Once you get past that, it&#8217;s all wide open. You&#8217;ll get to the island
without any trouble. That&#8217;s not the hard point. The hard point is right
here.&#8217;
<!--l. 68556--><p class="indent" >   I listened to him, really listened to him, and it went straight to the heart. &#8217;Even if
it kills you, don&#8217;t retreat at this point. Here at the beginning is the hardest part &#8212;
where the mind advances and regresses. This part is so hard that you&#8217;ll want to go
smash your head against that mountain over there out of frustration. The mind
advances and regresses, over and over again. Once you get past this point, though,
you&#8217;ll make progress easily, without any obstacles at all. That&#8217;s all there is
to it. Give it your best at the beginning and don&#8217;t retreat. Understand?&#8217;
That&#8217;s what he said. &#8217;If you retreat here, you won&#8217;t get anywhere. So give it
your life. Strike your way through right here. After all, your vision says
you can make it. No matter how difficult it gets, you can make it. So don&#8217;t
retreat.&#8217;
<!--l. 68570--><p class="indent" >   I remembered his words and took them to heart &#8212; happy and pleased. I kept
practicing until that following April in line with what he had said. The mind had
regressed ever since December the previous year until December of that year and
then on into April. It still hadn&#8217;t advanced. It would advance to full strength and
then deteriorate, again and again, for a year. It wasn&#8217;t until April that I found a new
approach, focusing on my meditation theme in a new way so that it was really solid.
From that point on I was able to sit in meditation all night long. The mind was
able to settle down in full measure, which is why I accelerated my efforts

from then on. Speaking of the difficulty, that&#8217;s how difficult it really was for
me.
<!--l. 68583--><p class="indent" >   From there on in, the mind was centered and never regressed. The way it
had regressed before was an excellent teacher. I&#8217;d absolutely refuse to let it
regress again: That was how I felt. If it regressed again, I&#8217;d die. I couldn&#8217;t
stand to stay in the world bearing the mass of suffering that would come if it
regressed again, because I had already been through it once &#8212; more than
a year of the most acute suffering. There&#8217;s no suffering that burns more
than the suffering that comes when the mind regresses. If it were to regress
again, it&#8217;d kill me, which was why I was really meticulous in keeping watch
over myself from then on. I wouldn&#8217;t let the mind regress, and so it kept on
progressing.
<!--l. 68595--><p class="indent" >   The first time I saw the marvelousness of the mind was when I began sitting in
meditation all night &#8212; right from the very first night. I was investigating pain, and
was it ever severe! At first I hadn&#8217;t planned on sitting until dawn, you know. I was
simply sitting along, and the pain began to grow. No matter how I contemplated
it, I didn&#8217;t get anywhere at all. &#8217;Eh. What is this? Okay, if I&#8217;m going to
die today, let me die.&#8217; So I made resolution in that moment: &#8217;From this
moment on, I won&#8217;t get up until dawn. So. If I survive, so be it. If not, so be
it.&#8217;
<!--l. 68605--><p class="indent" >   I struck right into the pain, to the point where the mind, which had never
examined anything in that way... Discernment had never moved into action that way,
you know, but when it was really cornered, at the end of its rope, discernment stirred
itself into action, keeping up with events from every angle until it was fully alert to
the pain, alert to the body, and understood the affairs of the mind. Each was a
separate reality. They then split away from one another and disappeared
completely, even though nothing like that had ever happened to me before.
The body disappeared from my sense of awareness. The pain completely
vanished. All that was left was an awareness that was simply aware. It wasn&#8217;t
the sort of outstanding awareness we might imagine it to be. It was just
simple awareness, but very subtle, very refined, and very amazing in that
moment.
<!--l. 68619--><p class="indent" >   When I retreated from that state, I renewed my investigation, but when I used
the strategies I had used before, I didn&#8217;t get any results, because they were now
allusions to the past. I had to come up with new strategies to keep up with
the events of the moment. The mind then settled down again. That night,
it settled down three times, and then dawn came. Was I ever amazed at
myself!
<!--l. 68626--><p class="indent" >   That morning when I got the chance, I went to tell Venerable Acariya Mun.
Normally, I&#8217;d be very intimidated by him, but that morning I wasn&#8217;t intimidated at
all. I wanted to tell him the truth, so that he could see the results of my being true
&#8212; how I had practiced so that things had occurred that way. I spoke with audacity,
even though I had never spoken that way with him before. I really told it to him
straight &#8212; crash! bang! &#8212; and after he had listened, he said, &#8217;That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s
got to be.&#8217; That&#8217;s just what he said! He really let me have it. He explained
things to my complete satisfaction. It was as if I were a dog: As soon as he

praised and spurred me on, this stupid dog I was, was all raring to bark and
bite.
<!--l. 68639--><p class="indent" >   After one or two more days, I sat up in meditation all night again. After another
two or three more days, I did it again, until the mind was thoroughly amazed. The
affairs of death, you know, disappear when the mind really knows. When you
separate the elements (dhatu) and khandhas to look at life and death, the four
elements of earth, water, wind, and fire dissolve down into their original properties as
earth, water, wind, and fire. Space returns to its original property as space. The mind
that used to fear death becomes even more prominent. So what is there to die?
When it knows so prominently in this way, how can it die? The mind doesn&#8217;t
die. So what does it fear? We&#8217;ve been lied to. The world of defilements has
been lying to us. (&#8217;Lying,&#8217; here, means that defilement has lied to the living
beings of the world, making them fear death, even though actually nothing
dies.)
<!--l. 68653--><p class="indent" >   When I&#8217;d investigate one day, I&#8217;d get one approach; another day, I&#8217;d get another
approach, but they were all hard-hitting and amazing. The mind was more and more
amazing and brave, to the point where I felt, &#8217;When the time comes to die, what sort
of pain do they think they&#8217;re going to bring out to fool me? Every facet of
today&#8217;s pain is complete in every way. Beyond this, there&#8217;s simply death.
I&#8217;ve seen all these pains, understood them all, and dealt with them all. So
when the time comes to die, what sort of pain are they going to bring out
to deceive me? There&#8217;s no way they can deceive me. The pain will have
to be just this sort of pain. As for death, nothing dies. So what is there
to fear aside from the defilements that lie to us, making us fall for their
fake tricks and deceits? From this point on, I&#8217;ll never fall for their tricks
again.&#8217;
<!--l. 68667--><p class="indent" >   That&#8217;s the way the mind is when it knows, and it knew clearly right
from the very first night. As for the mental state that had progressed and
regressed, up to that first night it hadn&#8217;t regressed. Beginning that previous
April, it hadn&#8217;t regressed but it still wasn&#8217;t clear. That first night, though, it
became clear: &#8217;Oh. This is how it&#8217;s supposed to be, the mind that doesn&#8217;t
regress.&#8217; It was as if it had been climbing up and falling down, climbing up and
falling down, until finally it climbed up and grabbed hold tight, 100 per cent
sure that it wouldn&#8217;t regress. This was why I stepped up my efforts full
speed.
<!--l. 68677--><p class="indent" >   During that Rains Retreat (vassa), I sat up all night in meditation nine or ten
times, but never two nights in a row. Sometimes I&#8217;d skip two or three nights,
sometimes six or seven. I got to the point where I was completely sure about pain &#8212;
heavy or light, big or small. I understood how to deal with pain, how to sidestep
it, how to cure it right in time, without being shaken by it. I wasn&#8217;t even
afraid of death, because I had investigated it with the most completely adroit
strategies. Mindfulness and discernment were completely up on death in every
way.
<!--l. 68687--><p class="indent" >   Speaking of effort in the practice, my tenth rains &#8212; beginning from the
April after my ninth rains &#8212; was when I made the most all-out effort. In all
my life, I have never made a more vigorous effort, in terms of the body,

than I did during my tenth rains. The mind went all out, and so did the
body. From that point on, I kept making progress until the mind was like
rock. In other words, I was skilled enough in the solidity and stability of my
concentration that the mind was like a slab of rock. It couldn&#8217;t easily be affected by
anything at all &#8212; and then I was stuck on that concentration for five full
years.
<!--l. 68698--><p class="indent" >   Once I was able to get past that concentration, thanks to the hard-hitting
Dhamma of Venerable Acariya Mun, I set out to investigate. When I began to
investigate with discernment, things went quickly and easily because my
concentration was fully prepared. It was as if all the materials for building a house
were right at hand, but I hadn&#8217;t yet put them together into a house, and so
they were just useless pieces of wood. My concentration simply stopped at
concentration that way. When I didn&#8217;t put it together into mindfulness and
discernment, it couldn&#8217;t support anything at all, which is why I had to set out
investigating in the way with which Venerable Acariya Mun hit me over the
head.
<!--l. 68709--><p class="indent" >   As soon as he hit me, I set out; and no sooner had I set out than I began to know
what was what. I was able to kill off that defilement, cut this one down, step by step.
I began to wake up: &#8217;Here I&#8217;ve been lying in concentration as if I were dead &#8212; for all
these months, all these years &#8212; and it hasn&#8217;t accomplished a thing!&#8217; So now I
stepped up my efforts at discernment, making it spin day and night without anything
to put a brake on it at all.
<!--l. 68717--><p class="indent" >   But, you know, I&#8217;m the sort of person who goes to extremes. Whatever
tack I set out on, that&#8217;s the only tack I take. When I began following the
path of discernment, I started criticizing concentration as being like lying
down dead. Actually, concentration is a means for resting the mind. If you
practice just right, that&#8217;s the way it is. But instead, I criticized concentration
as being like lying down dead. &#8217;All these years, and it hasn&#8217;t given rise to
discernment.&#8217;
<!--l. 68725--><p class="indent" >   So I stepped up my efforts at discernment, beginning first with the body. When I
contemplated unattractiveness, it was remarkable, you know. Really remarkable. The
mind, when it contemplated, was adroit and audacious. I could perceive right
through whatever I looked at &#8212; man, woman, no matter how young. To tell you
frankly how really audacious the mind was (and here I have to ask the forgiveness of
both the men and women involved if it&#8217;s wrong to speak too frankly), it
wouldn&#8217;t have to be a question of old women, you know. If the gathering
was full of young women, I could march right in without any sign of lust
appearing at all. That&#8217;s how daring the mind was because of its contemplation of
unattractiveness.
<!--l. 68737--><p class="indent" >   Looking at a person, there would just be the bones wrapped up in skin, nothing
but flesh all glaring and red. So where could I see any beauty? The power of the
unattractiveness was really strong. No matter whose body I looked at, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d
perceive it. So where would there be any beauty to make me feel desire? This was
why I&#8217;d dare march right in... really beautiful young women, you know. (I&#8217;ll have to
keep asking forgiveness until I&#8217;ve finished with this &#8217;forest madness.&#8217;) I could march
right in with no trouble at all when I felt daring like this, because I was sure of my

strength.
<!--l. 68747--><p class="indent" >   But this daring wasn&#8217;t right, in terms of the point at which the mind really had
its fill of lust, which is why I criticized myself afterwards, after the mind had passed
this point. This daring was a kind of madness, but while I was following the path,
it was right, because that was how I had to follow it through. This is like
criticizing food after you&#8217;ve eaten your fill. Right or wrong, it&#8217;s the same sort of
thing.
<!--l. 68754--><p class="indent" >   I contemplated unattractiveness until no physical desire appeared at all.
It gradually faded away, all on its own, without giving any reason at any
specific time or place. It didn&#8217;t give me any assurance that lust or passion for
the male or female body had disappeared at this or that point in time and
place, so I had to deliberate again. I wouldn&#8217;t go along with this simple
fading away on its own. That is, my mind wouldn&#8217;t accept it. If lust had
been wiped out at any particular point, there should have been some sort of
indication, so that I could know clearly that it was all gone for this or that
reason, at this or that moment, this or that place. It should have had its
moment.
<!--l. 68766--><p class="indent" >   So now the mind had to back up and contemplate to find various approaches to
remedy the situation. If it were really all gone, why hadn&#8217;t there been a clear
indication that it had been wiped out at this or that moment? As soon as I saw a
person&#8217;s body, I would perceive right through it. There would be nothing but flesh
and bones in that body. It wouldn&#8217;t be a beautiful woman or a beautiful person
or anything, because the power of my contemplation of unattractiveness
was so strong that I&#8217;d perceive everyone as a pile of bones. What would
there be to make the mind feel attraction or desire when it&#8217;s in a state like
that?
<!--l. 68776--><p class="indent" >   I now had to turn around and take a new approach. If physical desire had ended
without leaving a trace at a particular moment, using a particular strategy, why
hadn&#8217;t there been a clear indication? I turned around and contemplated another way.
I brought attractiveness in to force out the unattractiveness &#8212; the pile of bones &#8212;
covering it with skin to make it beautiful. I had to force the mind, you know.
Otherwise it would immediately break through to unattractiveness, because it was
so adept that way. I forced the mind to visualize the bones covered with
skin so that they&#8217;d be beautiful, and then had that beautiful body cling
right to mine. That was how I contemplated. I&#8217;d do walking meditation
visualizing the beauty of that body clinging to mine, clinging right to mine as I
walked back and forth. So. How much time would it take? If there was any
desire still left, it would have to show. If not, then let me know that it was
gone.
<!--l. 68791--><p class="indent" >   I practiced this way for four full days without any physical attraction or desire
appearing at all. Even though it was an extremely beautiful body, nothing appeared.
The image kept trying to change into a pile of bones wrapped in skin, but I forced
the mind to stay just at the skin level.
<!--l. 68797--><p class="indent" >   The fourth night, tears began to flow. &#8217;I&#8217;ve had enough. I give in.&#8217; In other words,
the mind wasn&#8217;t feeling any pleasure. It said that it had had enough, so I tested it
again: &#8217;Enough of what? If you admit that there&#8217;s no more desire, then let me know.

I won&#8217;t accept your giving in like this. To give in like this is just a ruse. I won&#8217;t go
along with it.&#8217;
<!--l. 68804--><p class="indent" >   I kept on contemplating every facet to find which facet would make the mind feel
desire, to see at which moment the desire would arise, so that I could then take
whatever might appear and focus on it as the object to be contemplated and
uprooted. The night got later and later, and I kept on focusing in &#8212; but
I wasn&#8217;t focused on contemplating unattractiveness at that point. I was
contemplating nothing but attractiveness for those entire four days, because
I was determined to find an approach to test and learn the truth of the
situation.
<!--l. 68814--><p class="indent" >   After about 9 or 10 p.m. the night of the fourth day, there was a flickering, as if
the mind was going to feel lust for that beautiful body that had been clinging to me
constantly during that period. It was a peculiar sort of flickering. Mindfulness was
alert to it, because mindfulness was there all the time. As soon as the flickering
appeared, I kept encouraging it. &#8217;See that flickering? We&#8217;ve caught the criminal who
has been in hiding. See? So how can it be gone? If it&#8217;s gone, why does it have to
behave like this?&#8217; I focused in on it. That flickering was simply a condition of the
mind that appeared only slightly, with no effect on the body at all. It was inside the
mind. When I encouraged it, it would flicker again, which proved that it wasn&#8217;t all
gone.
<!--l. 68826--><p class="indent" >   So now that it wasn&#8217;t all gone, what was I supposed to do?
<!--l. 68828--><p class="indent" >   I now had to take a new approach, by alternating my tactics. Since this
was a path I had never taken before, something I had never known before,
it was very difficult to proceed. As soon as I&#8217;d focus on unattractiveness,
attractiveness would vanish in the flash of an eye. It would vanish extremely fast
because I was already adept at unattractiveness. As soon as I&#8217;d focus on
unattractiveness, the body would turn immediately into a pile of bones, so I
would have to focus on attractiveness to make it beautiful again. I kept
changing back and forth between the two this way. This took a long time
because it was a path I had never trod. I didn&#8217;t understand, so I had to
try out different methods until I could be sure and settle on one path or
another.
<!--l. 68840--><p class="indent" >   I finally came to the truth when I was sitting visualizing an image of
unattractiveness right in front of me. The mind focused on unattractiveness standing
still right there. I wouldn&#8217;t let it move or change in any way. I had it stay right there
like that. If it was an image of bones wrapped in skin or a pile of bones with the skin
removed, I had it stay right there in front of me. The mind stared right at it, with
mindfulness focused, waiting to learn the truth from that image of unattractiveness,
to see what it would do, how this pile of unattractiveness would move or
change.
<!--l. 68850--><p class="indent" >   However I stared at it, that&#8217;s how it would stay, because of the adeptness
of the mind. If I wouldn&#8217;t have it destroy the image, it wouldn&#8217;t destroy
it. I forced it not to destroy it. If I had focused on destroying it, it would
have been demolished in an instant because of the speed of discernment.
But I didn&#8217;t let the mind destroy it. I had it stay right there in front of me
in order to exercise and experiment to find the truth of which I could be

certain.
<!--l. 68858--><p class="indent" >   As I kept focusing in, the image of unattractiveness standing there before me was
gradually sucked into the mind, absorbed into the mind, so that I finally realized that
unattractiveness was a matter of the mind itself. The state of mind that
had fixed on the idea of unattractiveness sucked it in &#8212; which meant that
attractiveness and unattractiveness were simply a matter of the mind deceiving
itself.
<!--l. 68865--><p class="indent" >   The mind then let go in a flash. It let go of external unattractiveness. It
understood now because it had made the break. &#8217;This is how it&#8217;s supposed to be. It&#8217;s
been simply a matter of the mind painting pictures to deceive itself, getting excited
over its shadows. Those external things aren&#8217;t passion, aversion, and delusion The
mind is what has passion, aversion, and delusion.&#8217; As soon as the mind knew this
clearly, it extricated itself from external affairs and came inward. As soon as the
mind would &#8217;blip&#8217; outward, it knew that these inner affairs were displaying
themselves. So now the image of unattractiveness appeared exclusively within the
mind.
<!--l. 68876--><p class="indent" >   I then focused and investigated within the mind. But now it wasn&#8217;t a matter of
that sort of passion. It was something very different. The affairs of worldly passion
now were all gone. The mind understood clearly that things had to make the break
that way. It had passed its verdict. It had understood. So now that there was the
image appearing within, the mind focused within. As soon as it focused within, it
knew clearly that this internal image came from the mind. When it disappeared, it
disappeared here and didn&#8217;t go anywhere else. The instant after I&#8217;d focus on
making it appear, it would vanish. Before I had focused on it for long, it would
vanish.
<!--l. 68887--><p class="indent" >   After that, it was just like a lightning flash: As soon as I focused on
making an image, it would vanish immediately, so there was no time to
elaborate on its being attractive or anything at all, because of the speed of the
arising and disappearing. The instant it would appear &#8212; blip! &#8212; it would
vanish.
<!--l. 68893--><p class="indent" >   From that point on, there were no more images in the mind. The mind became a
completely empty mind. As for external unattractiveness, that problem had already
been taken care of. I had understood it from the moment it was sucked in toward the
mind, and the mind had immediately let go of external unattractiveness. It let go of
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, everything external &#8212; because the mind was what had
been the deceiver. Once I understood this point clearly, those other things were no
longer a problem. The mind had understood immediately and let go of external
things once and for all.
<!--l. 68903--><p class="indent" >   After the internal images had all disappeared, the mind was empty. Completely
empty. Whatever I focused on was completely empty. I&#8217;d look at trees, mountains,
buildings, and see them simply as shades, as shadows. The major part &#8212; the mind &#8212;
was empty all through. Even when I&#8217;d look at my own body, I&#8217;d see it simply as a
shadow. As for the mind itself, it was empty clear through &#8212; to the point where I
exclaimed to myself, &#8217;Is the mind really this empty?&#8217; It was empty at all times.
Nothing passed into it.
<!--l. 68912--><p class="indent" >   Even though it was that empty, I would form mental pictures as a way of

exercising it. Whatever image I&#8217;d form would be a means of exercising the mind to
make it even more adept at emptiness, to the point where after a single blip it&#8217;d be
empty &#8212; a single blip and it&#8217;d be empty. The moment anything was formed &#8212; blip!
&#8212; it&#8217;d be empty right then.
<!--l. 68919--><p class="indent" >   At this point &#8212; the point where the mind was empty in full measure &#8212; this
awareness was also prominent in full measure. It fully comprehended rupa, vedana,
sañña, sankhara and viññana. It fully let go of them on its own, without
anything left. All that was left was awareness. There was a feeling of relatedness
and intimacy, a very subtle sensitivity for this awareness that is hard to
describe in line with its reality. There was a feeling of absorption exclusively for
this awareness. Any other condition that arose would vanish in the same
instant.
<!--l. 68929--><p class="indent" >   I kept watch over it. Mindfulness and discernment on this level: If this were the
time of the Buddha, we would call them super-mindfulness and super-discernment,
but in our day and age we shouldn&#8217;t reach for those labels. It&#8217;s enough for our
purposes to call them automatic mindfulness and discernment. That&#8217;s appropriate
enough for them. There&#8217;s no need to call them anything more exalted than
that, for this doesn&#8217;t deviate at all from the truth as it exists. This is why
the mind was prominent, and this prominence made it bright all the way
through.
<!--l. 68938--><p class="indent" >   One day I was doing walking meditation on the western side of Wat Doi
Dhammachedi. I had gone without food for three or four days, and that
day was the lunar sabbath, so people were coming to the monastery to give
alms. I went off to do walking meditation from daybreak and came back
only when it was time to receive alms in front of the main hall. When I was
standing in contemplation on the meditation path, an uncanny feeling of
wonder arose, to the point where I exclaimed, &#8217;Why is it that this mind is so
amazing? Whatever I look at &#8212; even the earth on which I&#8217;m treading and
see clearly with my eyes &#8212; why is it that the mind, which is the major
part, is completely empty? There are no trees or mountains in the mind. It&#8217;s
completely empty, with nothing left. There&#8217;s nothing but emptiness filling the
heart.&#8217;
<!--l. 68952--><p class="indent" >   I stood there contemplating for a moment, when a kind of realization appeared:
&#8217;If there is a point or a center of the knower anywhere, that is the essence of a level of
being.&#8217; That&#8217;s what it said, and I was bewildered.
<!--l. 68957--><p class="indent" >   Actually, the word &#8217;point&#8217; referred to that point of the knower. If I had
understood this problem in terms of the truth that appeared to warn me, things
would have been able to disband right then and there. But instead of understanding,
I was bewildered &#8212; because it was something I had never before known or seen. If
there was a point, it would be the point of the knower. If there was a center, it would
mean the center of the knower. Where was it? There in that knowing mind. That was
the essence of a level of being. The statement that appeared in the mind
already said so clearly. There was nothing at all wrong about it, but I was
simply bewildered &#8212; &#8217;What is this?&#8217; &#8212; so for the time being I didn&#8217;t get
any benefit from it at all. I let more than three months pass by in vain,
even though the problem was still weighing on the mind. I couldn&#8217;t set it

down.
<!--l. 68972--><p class="indent" >   When the time came for me to know, I was contemplating just the mind &#8212;
nothing wide-ranging or anything &#8212; because the mind had already known everything
on the blatant level. Whatever sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations
there might be throughout the cosmos, the mind had already known, understood and
let go. It wasn&#8217;t interested in investigating them. It wasn&#8217;t even willing to investigate
rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara, or viññana at all. It was interested only in
that conspicuous awareness, together with the subtle feelings within the
mind.
<!--l. 68982--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness and discernment kept making contact with that awareness,
examining it back and forth. But you should know that the &#8217;point&#8217; I referred to was
still a conventional reality. No matter how magnificent it might be, it was still
magnificence in the realm of convention. No matter how radiant or splendid it might
be, it was still radiance and splendor in the realm of convention, because there was
still unawareness (avijja) within it.
<!--l. 68990--><p class="indent" >   Unawareness forms the essence of conventional reality. The point of that
prominence eventually began to show its ups and downs &#8212; in keeping with the very
refined level of the mind &#8212; so that I was able to catch sight of them. Sometimes it
was a little tarnished, sometimes radiant, sometimes stressful, sometimes at ease, in
line with the refinement of the mind on this level, enough for me to detect its
irregularities.
<!--l. 68998--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness and discernment on this level were very meticulous guardians of this
state of mind, you know. Instead of aiming my guns &#8212; mindfulness and
discernment &#8212; in on the mind, I had aimed them outside, as unawareness
had deceived me into doing. This is why unawareness is said to be really
cunning. There is nothing more cunning than unawareness, which is the final
point.
<!--l. 69005--><p class="indent" >   Greed, for example, is something blatant, easy to understand and plainly harmful,
and yet world is still content to feel greed. Think about it! Anger is also blatant, and
yet the world is still content to feel anger. Infatuation, love, hate: All these things are
blatant, easy to understand and plainly harmful, and yet the world is still content to
feel them.
<!--l. 69012--><p class="indent" >   But this was not the same sort of thing at all. It had gone way beyond. It
had let go of all those other things, but why was it still attached to this
radiance, this marvel? Now that it was inside, it would become tarnished, just a
little. It would display stress, just a little &#8212; which was a form of change
and nothing constant or trustworthy &#8212; so that I could catch sight of it,
using mindfulness and discernment that were continually focused there at all
times without letup, trying to know and see how this state of mind would
behave.
<!--l. 69021--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately, there was no escaping it: I had to see that this state of mind was
nothing to be trusted, so I came to reflect, &#8217;Why is it that this state of mind can be
so changeable? Now it&#8217;s defiled, now it&#8217;s radiant, now it&#8217;s easeful, now it&#8217;s stressful.
It&#8217;s not always constant and true. Why is it that a mind as refined as this can still
show such a variety of conditions?
<!--l. 69028--><p class="indent" >   As soon as mindfulness and discernment had turned to take an interest in

investigating this state of mind, a totally unexpected realization sprang up within the
mind: &#8217;Defilement, radiance, ease, and stress: These are all conventional realities.
They&#8217;re all anatta &#8212; not-self.&#8217;
<!--l. 69034--><p class="indent" >   That was enough. Mindfulness and discernment realized that that state of mind
immersed in unawareness was a conventional reality that should simply be let
go. It shouldn&#8217;t be held to. A moment after this realization arose to warn
mindfulness and discernment, which were acting as the sentinels at that
moment, it was as if the mind, mindfulness, and discernment each became
impartial and impassive, not stirring themselves to perform any duty at
all. At that moment the mind was neutral, not focused on anything, not
alluding absentmindedly to anything anywhere. Discernment didn&#8217;t do any
work. Mindfulness was alert in its normal way, without being focused on
anything.
<!--l. 69045--><p class="indent" >   That moment &#8212; when the mind, mindfulness, and discernment were
each impassiveand impartial &#8212; was the moment when the cosmos in the
mind over which unawareness held sway trembled and quaked. Unawareness
was thrown down from its throne on the heart. In its place, the pure mind
appeared at the same moment that unawareness was toppled, smashed, and
eradicated through the power of triumphant mindfulness and discernment &#8212; the
moment when the sky came crashing down and the cosmos (within) trembled
and quaked, showing its final marvel on the border between convention and
release. Judgment was passed in the court of justice, with knowledge and
vision of release acting as judge. The middle way, the truth of the path,
was declared absolute winner, while the truth of the origin of stress was
knocked out and carried off on a stretcher, with no way of reviving ever
again.
<!--l. 69059--><p class="indent" >   I was utterly astounded and exclaimed, &#8217;Isn&#8217;t it amazing? Isn&#8217;t it amazing? Where
has this Dhamma been hiding? How is it that the genuine Dhamma, this
amazing Dhamma, exceeding all expectations &#8212; exceeding all the world &#8212; has
now appeared in the mind and is one with the mind? And before where
were the Buddha and Noble Sangha? How is it that these tremendously
amazing refuges have now become one with the heart? Is this what the true
Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha are like?&#8217; They didn&#8217;t fit in with any guesses
or speculations at all, but were simply a pure truth dwelling with a pure
truth.
<!--l. 69069--><p class="indent" >   Then I reflected with discouragement back on my fellow living beings
with regard to the Dhamma that was in my heart: &#8217;Since this is what the
genuine Dhamma is like, how could it be brought out and taught so that
others would know and understand? Wouldn&#8217;t it be more appropriate to
live alone until the day the body breaks apart, rather than try to teach
anyone?&#8217;
<!--l. 69076--><p class="indent" >   As soon as I considered this, a kind of realization suddenly appeared to me: &#8217;The
Lord Buddha knew this amazing Dhamma all by himself but was able to become the
Teacher of living beings throughout the three levels of the cosmos. How is it that I
have been able to teach myself and yet get discouraged at the thought of being able
to teach others? The way to teach, the way to know isn&#8217;t hidden or mysterious.&#8217;

When I realized this, my discouragement at the thought of teaching my friends
gradually faded away.
<!--l. 69085--><p class="indent" >   This event made me think of the first moments after the Buddha&#8217;s Awakening,
when he wearied at the thought of taking the excellent Dhamma in his heart and
teaching it to the world because he felt that it lay beyond the capability of
other people to realize it. Even though he had aspired to be a Teacher, to
instruct the world, he felt that the Dhamma he had realized was a Dhamma
beyond reach, that it would be hopeless to encourage the world to accept it
and practice so as to know it. But when he reflected on the path he had
followed to Awakening, he realized that the Dhamma wasn&#8217;t beyond reach or
beyond hope, that there would be infinite benefits for the world if he were to
teach the way of the Dhamma whose results he had come to see beyond a
doubt. This was why he made up his mind to teach the world from that point
on.
<!--l. 69099--><p class="indent" >   The reason I had felt the same way was because it was a Dhamma I had never
before seen or known, and it was a Dhamma utterly amazing. When I looked solely
at the results in the present, without reflecting back on the causes &#8212; the path I had
followed &#8212; I felt disheartened and abandoned the idea of telling or teaching anyone
about this Dhamma. But since reflecting back on the path I had followed, I have felt
more like speaking and acting out the various facets of the Dhamma, in line with the
various levels of people who have become involved with me, who have studied and
trained with me ever since, to the point where I have become a sham Acariya as
decreed by monks, novices and people in general. This being the case, I&#8217;ve
had to speak, teach, preach, and scold, heavily or lightly as events may call
for.
<!--l. 69113--><p class="indent" >   I have to beg the forgiveness of my listeners and readers for speaking in an
uncouth way to the point of being ugly, but when this scrap of a monk was hiding
out in the forest and mountains, he suffered mightily while training himself by
struggling in various ways on the verge of death &#8212; because of all sorts of sufferings
&#8212; without anyone to provide him with a funeral. No one knew or was interested,
except for a few of those people in the forest and mountains on whom I depended to
keep my life going from one day to the next, who may have known of some aspects of
some of my sufferings.
<!--l. 69123--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, the statement that the Buddha practiced to the point of losing
consciousness before gaining Awakening is a truth that those who practice
wholeheartedly for the sake of the Dhamma, the paths, fruitions, and nibbana, have
to believe wholeheartedly without any doubt. Only those who have never
practiced or had any interest in practice, or who practice by tying pillows to
the backs of their heads and waiting for defilement to die, or dig graves for
defilement by lying down and waiting to rake in the paths, fruitions and nibbana,
won&#8217;t believe in the difficulty with which the Buddha and his Noble Disciples
practiced.
<!--l. 69134--><p class="indent" >   Especially at present, when people are very clever: Whatever would fly in the face
of their already being wise and all-knowing, no matter how right or good or fantastic
that thing might be, they aren&#8217;t willing to use it to take the measure of their own
wisdom. As a result, their wisdom can&#8217;t escape creating a lot of foolishness for

themselves and the common good. For this reason, the path leading to depravity
for the mind and the path leading to Dhamma within the mind are very
different.
<!--l. 69142--><p class="indent" >   Those who practice, the Dhamma says, are those who investigate and reflect on
every facet of the world and the Dhamma without being complacent. No matter what
posture we are in, no matter where, we should always use mindfulness and
discernment to look after ourselves. We shouldn&#8217;t be concerned with the deficient or
developed manners, the good or bad behavior of other people, the points they give us
or take away, more than we are concerned with our own deficient or developed
manners, our own good or bad behavior and the points we give or take away from
ourselves. This is the path of the Dhamma for those who practice the Dhamma, who
are always embued with Dhamma. The opposite way is the low path for those with
low minds, with no righteousness infiltrating them at all. This is a warning for all
those meditators who have come here for training to understand and take to
heart.
<!--l. 69156--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma I have related today is mostly personal and isn&#8217;t appropriate to be
made public to people at large whose sensitivities may vary. I myself might be open
to criticism, and it might be harmful to the attitudes of those who hear or read when
the tape is transcribed onto paper &#8212; except for restricted circles of people who would
understand. To make this talk public thus goes against the grain with me, but the
extent to which I have made it public is out of sympathy for those who have
come for training in all rectitude and who have pleaded with me to make it
public as an example that those who practice may follow for a long time to
come.
<!--l. 69167--><p class="indent" >   If this is wrong in any way, I ask the forgiveness of all my readers. It&#8217;s with the
thought that there will be many people endowed with rectitude in the practice of
meditation, both now and the future, who might get some benefit from this
outlandish talk, that I put up with the embarrassment of having exposed my own
stupidity in it.
<!--l. 69173--><p class="indent" >   Unawareness Converges, Concealing The True Dhamma, the True Mind
<!--l. 69175--><p class="indent" >   This Dhamma talk was given as an answer to a question posed by one of the more
important senior monks of our day and age. The gist is as follows:
<!--l. 69179--><p class="indent" >   This was when I began to investigate into the converging point of the cycle of
defilement &#8212; namely, unawareness. While I was investigating, I didn&#8217;t know
that I was investigating unawareness. I was simply thinking, &#8217;What is this?&#8217;
There was an uncertainty right there, so I focused the mind there, directed
my attention to investigate what it was, where it came from, where it was
going.
<!--l. 69186--><p class="indent" >   It so happened I hit the right spot: I say this because I didn&#8217;t know that it was
called, or what unawareness was. Actually, unawareness and its name are very
different. We see its currents spreading out all over the world, but those are only
its branches. It&#8217;s like trying to catch an outlaw: At first all we can catch
are his henchmen. Whoever we catch is just a henchman. We don&#8217;t know
where the chief outlaw is, or what he looks like, because we have never seen
him.
<!--l. 69194--><p class="indent" >   We catch lots of his henchmen, closing in on him, encircling him. This is called

laying siege to the outlaw. Our police force is very large and very strong. Each person
on the force helps the others, so they have a lot of strength, surrounding the spot
where the outlaw lies, catching this person, tying up that one. Ordinarily when
they&#8217;re asked, outlaws won&#8217;t tell who their chief is. Whenever we catch an outlaw, we
tie him up until no one is left inside our siege line. The last person left is the
chief outlaw. The last person lies in a strategic place, because his henchmen
have to guard him well on all sides so that no one can easily slip in to see
him.
<!--l. 69205--><p class="indent" >   The henchmen keep getting captured one after another until we reach the
cave in which the chief outlaw is hiding, and then we kill everyone in there.
This is when we know clearly that the wily outlaw has been wiped out for
good.
<!--l. 69210--><p class="indent" >   This is simply an analogy. To put it in other words, the mind&#8217;s involvement with
anything is a branch of delusion. Regardless of whether the delusion leads in a good
or a bad direction, it&#8217;s nothing but an affair of unawareness and the branches of
unawareness, but actual unawareness itself doesn&#8217;t lie there. So the tactics for
investigating it, if we were to use another analogy, are like bailing water out of a
pond to catch the fish in it. If there&#8217;s a lot of water, we don&#8217;t know how many fish it
contains. So we keep bailing out the water until it starts receding lower and lower.
The fish gather together. Each fish, wherever it is, swims down deeper into the water.
The water keeps getting bailed out, and the fish keep gathering together. We can
see where each fish is going, because the water keeps receding until at last,
when the water is dry, the fish have nowhere to hide, and so we can catch
them.
<!--l. 69225--><p class="indent" >   Sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations, together with the mental acts
that intermingle with them: These are like the water in which the fish live. To
investigate these things is not for the purpose of taking possession of them but for
the purpose of killing defilement, in the same way that a person bails out the water,
not because he wants the water but because he wants the fish. To investigate these
things is not for the purpose of taking possession of them but for the purpose of
knowing them, stage by stage. As soon as we know to a certain point, we are no
longer concerned with that point. We know the things with which we are
involved, as well as the fact that we are the one at fault for being involved, that
our own misunderstanding is what deludes us into loving and hating these
things.
<!--l. 69238--><p class="indent" >   At this point, the scope of our investigation keeps narrowing in, narrowing in, just
as the water keeps receding. Whatever elements or khandhas we investigate, they are
just like external things in general. There are no differences. On the material side, the
elements are the same elements. The difference lies in the acts of the mind that
display themselves &#8212; but we aren&#8217;t yet aware of them, so we go labeling
things in line with them, which is still one of the branches of unawareness.
But as our investigation seeps deeper and deeper into the central area, the
more clearly we see the things that come to be involved with us, the more
clearly we see the mind as it goes out to become involved each time &#8212; in
the same way that the more the water recedes, the more clearly we see the
fish.

<!--l. 69251--><p class="indent" >   As we investigate, the more clearly we see phenomena outside and inside the
body, as well as our own mental concomitants (cetasika), then the more
clearly we see the point where the chief culprit lies. As our investigation
keeps closing in, the mind&#8217;s focus grows narrower and narrower. Its concerns
grow less and less. The currents sent out by the mind grow shorter. As soon
as it stirs itself to become involved with any object, we investigate both
that object and the stirring of the mind as it goes out to act. We see both
aspects. We see the causes and results on both sides, namely (1) the side with
which the mind involves itself, the things with which it is involved; and
(2) the one who becomes involved. Discernment keeps moving in, step by
step.
<!--l. 69264--><p class="indent" >   When it moves in and reaches unawareness itself, meditators for the most part &#8212;
if no teacher has warned them in advance &#8212; are bound to hold to that as their real
self. This is because they have investigated and seen all things clearly in the heart, so
that they are fully wise to those things and have let them go, with nothing remaining
&#8212; but what is it that knows those things? This is what they take and cherish. This is
termed unawareness converging, but it turns into their &#8217;self&#8217; without their realizing
it. The mind gets deluded there. The term &#8217;unawareness&#8217; refers to this very
delusion about oneself. Delusions about outside things are not matters of actual
unawareness.
<!--l. 69276--><p class="indent" >   Because of our delusion about this, because of our delusion about that
which knows all other things, we forget to investigate and pass judgment on
what it is &#8212; because when the scope of the mind narrows, it gathers itself
into a point. The point of the mind that appears at this stage is a radiant
mind, bright, cheerful, and bold. All happiness seems to be gathered right
there. What do these things come from? If you were to call them results, I&#8217;d
have to admit that they are results. We could say that they&#8217;re results of the
practice &#8212; if we aren&#8217;t deluded about this point. If we&#8217;re still deluded, these
things are still the origin of stress. This is the central point of the origin of
stress.
<!--l. 69288--><p class="indent" >   But if we&#8217;re meditators who are always interested in investigating whatever
comes our way, we won&#8217;t overlook this. No matter what, we can&#8217;t help but
become interested in investigating this point &#8212; because we have already
investigated and understood all things of every sort to the point where the
mind won&#8217;t make contact with them. If we take the mind out to investigate
anything, it won&#8217;t make contact, because it has already had enough of that
thing.
<!--l. 69296--><p class="indent" >   Now, every mental act that arises, arises from this point. Thoughts that
form, form from this point. The happiness that appears, appears here. The
happiness that appears undergoes changes we can see: This is what makes
us begin investigating again, because this is a level in which we are very
observant. When we observe the happiness, we see that it isn&#8217;t steady, for the
happiness produced by unawareness is a conventional reality. Sometimes it
gets tarnished a little &#8212; just a little &#8212; enough for us to know that it isn&#8217;t
uniform. It keeps changing in that way, in line with its status as a refined
phenomenon.

<!--l. 69307--><p class="indent" >   This is the point that we trust and believe in. Even those who practice with
intensity and extreme interest will fall for this point and become attached to it if no
one has explained it to them in advance. But even though we trust in it, we can&#8217;t
help observing it if we are interested, because that&#8217;s all there is that attracts
the heart. This is what causes us to be attracted to it, to be content with
what appears. As long as we have been investigating, that&#8217;s the way it has
been &#8212; to the extent that we don&#8217;t know what unawareness is &#8212; and so we
believe that this will be nibbana, this point that is bright and clear all the
time.
<!--l. 69318--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;All the time&#8217; here means all the time for those meditators who are persistent in
cleansing it and who aren&#8217;t entirely complacent in their trust for it, who are very
protective of this point and won&#8217;t let anything touch it. Such people use a great
deal of caution. As soon as anything touches that point, they will rectify it
immediately.
<!--l. 69324--><p class="indent" >   But they don&#8217;t know what it is that they love and cherish. Even though that love
and cherishing is clearly a burden, they don&#8217;t realize the fact at that moment.
Only when enough time has passed for them to be ready to know will they
become interested in investigating this point. &#8217;What is this? We&#8217;ve investigated
everything of every sort, but what is this?&#8217; Now the mind focuses in on
that point. Discernment probes in. &#8217;What is this, for sure? Is it true yet or
not? Is it awareness or unawareness?&#8217; These doubts keep nagging at the
mind.
<!--l. 69333--><p class="indent" >   But we keep on investigating and contemplating, using discernment without
ceasing &#8212; because this is something we have never seen, never met with before &#8212; to
see why we love it, why we are protective of it. If it&#8217;s something true, why do we have
to love and protect it? Why do we have to care for it? To care for something is a
burden, in which case this must be a hazard for the person who cherishes and cares
for it, or something that shouldn&#8217;t be trusted &#8212; even though at that moment we still
don&#8217;t know what it is, whether it&#8217;s really unawareness or not, because we have never
seen how true awareness differs from unawareness, or how release differs
from conventional reality. This is where discernment becomes interested in
investigating.
<!--l. 69346--><p class="indent" >   Now, I&#8217;d say that this is something very elaborate and involved. If I were to
describe it in line with how I investigated it, or to condense it so as to give the gist in
a reasonable amount of time, I&#8217;d summarize quickly by saying whatever makes an
appearance, investigate it. Whatever makes an appearance is a matter of
conventional reality &#8212; I&#8217;m referring here to the refined phenomena that appear in
the heart. Ultimately, even that very point with its brightness is the point of genuine
unawareness. Focus down on it, using discernment. Just as all phenomena in
general are simply phenomena, this nature is also simply a phenomenon in
exactly the same way. We can&#8217;t latch onto it as being &#8217;us&#8217; or &#8217;ours&#8217; &#8212; but
our protectiveness shows that we hold to it as being us or ours, which is a
mistake.
<!--l. 69359--><p class="indent" >   Discernment probes inward to see just what this is, as if we were to turn around
to look at ourselves. We look outside and see the earth, the sky, the air. Whatever
passes into our range of vision, we see. But if we don&#8217;t look back at ourselves, we

won&#8217;t see ourselves. Discernment at this stage is very quick. It looks back
and forth, back and forth, to see this last point or this last stage, and its
investigation is just like its investigation of things in general. It investigates not to
take possession of its object but simply to know its object for what it truly
is.
<!--l. 69369--><p class="indent" >   When this disbands, it&#8217;s not like other things disbanding. When other things
disband, they go with a feeling that we understand them. But this isn&#8217;t like that.
When it disbands, it disintegrates in an instant, like a lightning flash. There&#8217;s an
instant where it acts of its own accord &#8212; or you could say that it flips over. It flips
over and disappears completely. When it disappears, that&#8217;s when we know that it was
genuine unawareness &#8212; because once this has disappeared, nothing more appears for
us to doubt.
<!--l. 69378--><p class="indent" >   What remains is nothing like it at all. It&#8217;s a pure nature. Even though we have
never seen it before, when it appears in that moment, there is nothing to doubt &#8212;
and that&#8217;s how the burden is all gone.
<!--l. 69383--><p class="indent" >   The word &#8217;I&#8217; refers to this genuine unawareness. It means that this unawareness is
still standing. Whatever we have been investigating has been for its sake. Whatever
we say we know, this &#8217;I&#8217; is what knows. Radiant? &#8217;I&#8217;m&#8217; radiant. Light? &#8217;I&#8217;m&#8217; light.
Happy? &#8217;I&#8217;m&#8217; happy. &#8217;Me,&#8217; &#8217;I,&#8217; they refer to this. This is genuine unawareness.
Whatever we do is for its sake. Once it disintegrates, there is nothing more for
anything&#8217;s sake. It&#8217;s all gone.
<!--l. 69391--><p class="indent" >   If we were to make an analogy, it&#8217;s like a water jar whose bottom has been
smashed. No matter how much water we may pour into it, nothing stays in the jar.
Everything that may be formed in line with the nature of the khandhas can still be
formed, but nothing sticks because the vessel &#8212; unawareness, the chief culprit &#8212; has
disintegrated. As soon as sankharas form &#8212; blip! &#8212; they vanish. They simply pass
by, disappearing, disappearing, because there&#8217;s no place to keep them, no
one who owns them. The nature that realizes that nothing is its owner is a
nature that has reached itsfullness. It is thus a genuinely pure nature and no
longer a burden that needs to be watched over or protected from danger ever
again.
<!--l. 69403--><p class="indent" >   This unawareness is what has been concealing the true Dhamma, the true mind,
all along. This is why we haven&#8217;t seen the true, natural marvelousness of the mind.
For this reason, meditators who reach the stage of this pitfall latch onto it as
something marvelous, love it, cherish it, are protective of it, and regard it as &#8217;me&#8217; or
&#8217;mine&#8217;: &#8217;My mind is radiant. My mind is courageous and brave. My mind is happy.
My mind knows everything of every sort&#8217; &#8212; but this nature doesn&#8217;t know itself,
which is why the Buddha called it genuine unawareness. Once we turn around and
know it, it disintegrates. Once it disintegrates, it&#8217;s just like opening the lid of a pot:
Whatever is in the pot, we can see it all. Only unawareness keeps the mind
concealed.
<!--l. 69415--><p class="indent" >   This purity is a truth that lies beyond the truths of stress, its origin, its cessation
and the path. It&#8217;s a truth beyond the four Noble Truths. Of the four truths, one pair
binds, the other unbinds and stops. What do they bind and unbind? They
bind the heart, or keep it covered; and they unbind the heart, or uncover
it. They open up the things that cover it so as to reveal its purity in line

with its truth. Its truth is already there, but the two truths of stress and
its origin keep it concealed, just as the lid of a pot conceals whatever is in
the pot so that we can&#8217;t see it. The path &#8212; the practice &#8212; opens it. The
path and the cessation of stress open the pot so that we can see clearly
what&#8217;s inside. Even though the purity is already there, it&#8217;s concealed by
the first two truths and revealed by the truths that unbind. This is what
is bound, this is what is revealed. Once it&#8217;s revealed, there are no more
problems.
<!--l. 69430--><p class="indent" >   Both pairs of truths are activities. Both are conventional realities. The path and
the cessation of stress are conventional realities. Once they have performed their
duties, they pass. Stress and the origin of stress are also conventional realities. Once
the two conventional realities remedy the two conventional realities, that pure nature
is a nature that stays fixed.
<!--l. 69437--><p class="indent" >   What we see at that point is called release. Things are opened so that we see
release, or natural purity. The burden of the task is ended right here. When the
mind is pure, it doesn&#8217;t confer any titles on itself. As for external things, the
worldly phenomena (loka-dhamma) connected with external things, they&#8217;re
far away. The worldly phenomena that we used to say were good or bad,
pleasant or painful in the heart, are no longer a problem once that point has
disintegrated.
<!--l. 69445--><p class="indent" >   When we investigate to this level, it&#8217;s not wide-ranging. If we can derive an
approach from the explanations given by a meditation master who has known and
passed this stage, we can make quick progress &#8212; but it&#8217;s important that we not set
up any expectations. Expectations are not the path. Whatever appears, keep
investigating and understanding that point &#8212; each successive thing as it appears.
That&#8217;s the correct path.
<!--l. 69453--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Unawareness&#8217; refers to the nature I have just explained. That&#8217;s genuine
unawareness. All other things are just its branches. Like a vine whose stem grows in
one place but that creeps to who-knows-where: No matter how long it is, it keeps
creeping and climbing. When we catch hold of it, we follow it in, follow it in, until we
reach its stem. Here&#8217;s the stem. Here&#8217;s the root. Once we pull up the root, the whole
thing dies.
<!--l. 69461--><p class="indent" >   In the same way, the branches of unawareness are many and long, so that when
we actually reach unawareness, we don&#8217;t know what it is. But we investigate it.
Discernment probes on in. Even though we don&#8217;t know that this is unawareness, our
investigation is on the right path, and so unawareness opens up of its own accord, in
the same way as when we eat: Fullness appears clearly for us to see step by step all
on its own.
<!--l. 69469--><p class="indent" >   So to summarize the issue of whether unawareness is a factor of rebirth or a factor
of kamma: It creates levels of being, it creates kamma relentlessly. These are both
matters of the same cycle. It keeps creating levels of being within itself. The
mind can&#8217;t lie still. It simply keeps creating being and birth all the time.
It works at accumulating these things for itself, but for the most part it
accumulates things that weigh it down constantly, making it sink to lower
levels.
<!--l. 69477--><p class="indent" >   When people talk about destroying the wheel of kamma, this unawareness is

what&#8217;s destroyed. Once this is destroyed, there are no more connections to create
further levels of being and birth. Even though the things that used to be involved
with us continue to become involved as they normally did, they pass by. They don&#8217;t
seep in. They don&#8217;t set up house and move into this spot the way they used to.
They simply pass by. And we know that this pure nature doesn&#8217;t connect
with anything. We have seen the connections of the mind, step by step,
and when we reach the level where it doesn&#8217;t connect with anything, we
know.
<!--l. 69487--><p class="indent" >   As for knowing the question of levels of being and birth, as to whether or not
we&#8217;ll be reborn, there is no need to speculate, because the present already
tells us clearly that when there are no connections to levels of being and
birth inside us, as we plainly see, there are no levels of being or birth to
continue into the future. The factory has been destroyed, and there is no
way it can rebuild itself. There is no way it can produce issues as it used
to. The factory that produced suffering has been destroyed once and for
all.
<!--l. 69496--><p class="indent" >   The phrase &#8217;khandhas pure and simple&#8217; refers to this stage. The khandhas are
khandhas pure and simple, without any defilements. If the mind isn&#8217;t defiled, the
khandhas aren&#8217;t defiled. They are simply tools. If the central part &#8212; the mind &#8212; is
defiled, each khandha follows it in being defiled. The body becomes a means for
increasing defilement in the heart. Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana all
become means for increasing defilement in the heart. If the mind is pure, the
khandhas for their part are also pure. Nothing is defiled. But if the mind is
defiled, the khandhas are defiled all the livelong day. This is the way the truth
is.
<!--l. 69507--><p class="indent" >   The creation of being and birth is a matter of the mind that keeps producing
itself. It can&#8217;t stay still. A mind that has the cycle in charge of its work or
supervising its work will have to keep itself spinning all the time. Whatever thoughts
it spins are for the sake of creating being and birth. As soon as the cycle
disintegrates, there is nothing to create being and birth any more.
<!--l. 69514--><p class="indent" >   Those whose minds have attained realization exclaim spontaneously in the heart
to proclaim the Dhamma unabashedly to the world, saying that there are no more
levels of being in which they
<!--l. 69518--><p class="indent" >   are to be reborn &#8212; as when the Buddha exclaimed, &#8217;aneka-jati-samsaram...&#8217;3
because he knew right in the present that there was nothing creating itself.
Goodness stayed in its own territory and didn&#8217;t seep in, didn&#8217;t mingle. Evil
stayed in its own territory and didn&#8217;t seep in or mingle. They didn&#8217;t come
running in. When we say that they didn&#8217;t come running in, it&#8217;s not that
he forced them not to. It was simply their own nature. When these things
come running in we don&#8217;t force them to. There&#8217;s simply a medium along
which they run. When there&#8217;s no more medium, they disconnect of their own
accord.
<!--l. 69528--><p class="indent" >   It seemed to me when I was investigating this &#8212; when unawareness disappeared
&#8212; that there was a moment that let me know very clearly. It was a moment &#8212; an
instant I hadn&#8217;t anticipated or expected. It was an instant that grabbed my
attention. The instant unawareness disappeared was an instant in which it

displayed itself, as if it flipped itself over into a new world (if you were to
call it a world). It flipped in the flash of an eye and vanished in the same
instant, although this wasn&#8217;t anything I had anticipated. I hadn&#8217;t intended
for it to flip. It happened of its own accord. This is something very subtle
that is impossible for me to describe correctly in line with the truth of that
instant.
<!--l. 69540--><p class="indent" >   In practicing the religion, if we practice it really to gain release from suffering,
there are two intricate points. To separate the attachments between the mind
and the body: This is one intricate point; and then this second intricate
point that was the final point of my ability. Other than that there&#8217;s nothing
devious.
<!--l. 69546--><p class="indent" >   Once, when I went to practice at Wat Doi Dhammachedi, the problem of
unawareness had me bewildered for quite some time. At that stage the mind was so
radiant that I came to marvel at its radiance. Everything of every sort that could
make me marvel seemed to have gathered there in the mind, to the point where I
began to marvel at myself, &#8217;Why is it that my mind is so marvelous?&#8217; Looking at the
body, I couldn&#8217;t see it at all. It was all space &#8212; empty. The mind was radiant in full
force.
<!--l. 69555--><p class="indent" >   But luckily, as soon as I began to marvel at myself to the point of exclaiming
deludedly in the heart without being conscious of it &#8212; if we speak on the level of
refined Dhamma, it was a kind of delusion; it was amazed at itself, &#8217;Why
has my mind come so far?&#8217; &#8212; at that moment, a statement of Dhamma
spontaneously arose. This too I hadn&#8217;t anticipated. It suddenly appeared, as if
someone were speaking in the heart, although there was no one there speaking.
It simply appeared as a statement: &#8217;If there is a point or a center of the
knower anywhere, that is the essence of a level of being.&#8217; That&#8217;s what it
said.
<!--l. 69566--><p class="indent" >   That phenomenon actually was a point: the point of knowledge, the point of
radiance. It really was a point, just as the statement had said. But I didn&#8217;t take into
consideration what the &#8217;point&#8217; was and so I was bewildered. Instead of gaining an
approach from the warning that had appeared, I took the problem to chew over until
I came to consider the part about the &#8217;point.&#8217; That was what ended the problem. I
then came back to understand clearly the matter of, &#8217;If there is a point or a center of
the knower anywhere, that is the essence of a level of being.&#8217; That was when
I understood, &#8217;Oh &#8212; I see. The words "point" and "center" refer to just
this.&#8217; Before, I hadn&#8217;t understood. It really was a point. No matter how
marvelous, it was the point of the marvelousness. It was a point there to be
known. Once that disintegrated, there were no more points, because every
point is a conventional reality. No matter how refined, each is a conventional
reality.
<!--l. 69582--><p class="indent" >   This is why I am always teaching my fellow meditators: &#8217;Once you&#8217;ve reached that
point, don&#8217;t be protective of anything. Investigate on in. Even if the mind
should actually be demolished by that investigation, let it be demolished.
Whatever is left to be aware of the purity, let it be aware &#8212; or if everything is
going to be demolished so that there is nothing left to be aware of purity,
then at least find out. Don&#8217;t be protective of anything at all.&#8217; I say this out

of fear that they&#8217;ll be protective of this thing. If they aren&#8217;t warned that
forcefully, then no matter what, they&#8217;re bound to get stuck. All I ask is
that they find out: &#8217;Whatever is going to vanish, let it vanish. Even if the
mind is going to vanish from the power of the investigation, let it vanish.
There&#8217;s no need to protect it.&#8217; When investigating, you have to take it that
far.
<!--l. 69596--><p class="indent" >   But there&#8217;s no escaping the truth: Whatever arises has to vanish; whatever is
true, whatever is a natural principle in and of itself, won&#8217;t vanish. In other words, the
pure mind won&#8217;t vanish. Everything of every sort may vanish, but that which knows
their vanishing doesn&#8217;t vanish. This vanishes, that vanishes, but the one that
knows their vanishing doesn&#8217;t vanish. Whether or not we try to leave it
untouched, it keeps on knowing. But to try to protect it is tantamount to
protecting unawareness, because unawareness is subtle. It&#8217;s there in the
mind. To be protective of the mind is tantamount to being protective of
unawareness.
<!--l. 69607--><p class="indent" >   So then. If the mind is going to be destroyed along with it, let it be destroyed. To
make a comparison with slashing, slash right on down. Don&#8217;t let there be anything
left. Let everything in there close up shop and leave. To take it that far is just
right.
<!--l. 69612--><p class="indent" >   If you&#8217;re hesitant, then you are sure to get stuck at this level. That&#8217;s why you
can&#8217;t let yourself be hesitant. You have to take the defilements all out. Whatever is
going to vanish, let it all vanish. As for that which is in no position to vanish, it
won&#8217;t vanish no matter what. To put it simply, it&#8217;s as if bandits had gotten into this
house. If you&#8217;re protective of the house where the bandits are, then &#8212; Bang! &#8212;
they&#8217;ll shoot you dead. So if you should burn the whole house down, then burn it
down. If you let the bandits stay there, they&#8217;ll go on to destroy things that have more
value than the house. So be willing to sacrifice the house. Set fire to it. This is
called setting fire to unawareness. If the mind is really going to vanish, let it
vanish.
<!--l. 69625--><p class="indent" >   But actually the mind doesn&#8217;t vanish. Only when you have burned that thing will
you know: &#8217;Oh &#8212; the thing of value has been lying beneath the power of
unawareness. Unawareness has had it covered.&#8217; The instant unawareness vanishes,
this other thing is revealed. Instead of vanishing too, it doesn&#8217;t vanish, but if you&#8217;re
protective of it you&#8217;ll be stuck and will never get free.
<!--l. 69632--><p class="indent" >   The period when I was investigating this point was after Venerable Acariya Mun
had passed away. I really felt at the end of my rope. I couldn&#8217;t stay with my fellow
meditators. I couldn&#8217;t stay with anyone at all. They&#8217;d get in the way. They&#8217;d spoil
the fun of my internal efforts at investigation &#8212; because at that time the mind was
really spinning. It had reached the level where it would spin and spin without
stopping. At the time, I called it &#8217;spinning as a wheel of Dhamma (dhamma-cakka),
not as a wheel of rebirth (vatta-cakka).&#8217; It spun to release itself. It spun all the time.
And as soon as it fully reached a state of enough, it stopped &#8212; completely and
unexpectedly.
<!--l. 69644--><p class="indent" >   For a while, at first, I had been getting annoyed. &#8217;The more I&#8217;ve investigated this
mind &#8212; and the more refined it has become &#8212; why has the burden, instead of
growing lighter, become so heavy like this? And it doesn&#8217;t have any sense of day or

night &#8212; why is it?&#8217; I was getting a little concerned and annoyed. But even though I
was annoyed, the mind didn&#8217;t let up. It kept spinning there, right before my eyes.
It kept spinning, scratching, and digging, looking for things that I hadn&#8217;t
yet known or seen. Wherever I was caught up at any point, it would keep
digging and scratching its way away. As soon as it made contact, it would
immediately latch on and stick with it. As soon as it understood, the matter
would pass and disappear. The mind would then continue probing. Had
Venerable Acariya Mun been alive at that point, things would have gone more
quickly.
<!--l. 69658--><p class="indent" >   This is why I have taught my fellow meditators that I&#8217;ll give them my all. If I
can&#8217;t solve their problems, I&#8217;ll take them to a teacher who can. Those are the lengths
I&#8217;ll go to &#8212; so that my fellow meditators can put their minds to rest. And for this
reason, I&#8217;m not willing to have some of my talks recorded, because I let everything
out. As soon as I&#8217;ve finished, the sound vanishes. I talk just for those who are there.
People who didn&#8217;t understand those matters would think I was bragging. Actually, I
speak in line with the truth and to encourage my students: &#8217;It has to be like this. You
have to slash into it like this.&#8217; That&#8217;s just how I put it. It&#8217;s as if I give myself
as a guarantee so that my students can be confident that what I say isn&#8217;t
wrong and so that they&#8217;ll feel inspired to apply themselves to the effort
with strength and resilience. Other people, though, who didn&#8217;t understand
my motives or anything, would think I was bragging. Instead of benefiting,
they&#8217;d be harmed. Even if I weren&#8217;t harmed, they might be, so I have to be
careful.
<!--l. 69675--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, on some occasions and with some people where I should really
pull out all the stops, that&#8217;s what I do. Otherwise I can&#8217;t put my mind to rest about
them. We really have to give and take. It&#8217;s as if we both open up and give it our all
to the point where we keep nothing back, not even a cent. This is the way it
sometimes is, on some occasions, but not always. It depends on the situation, how far
we should go. If we go that far, then if other people listened in, they&#8217;d think we were
crazy.
<!--l. 69684--><p class="indent" >   I myself, when listening to Venerable Acariya Mun talk: If he&#8217;d take it that far,
it&#8217;d go straight to the heart. For three days afterwards I would feel as if the leaves on
the trees weren&#8217;t moving. The atmosphere would seem absolutely still. The power of
his Dhamma blanketed everything &#8212; because the people listening were really intent
on listening, the person speaking was really intent on speaking, and so they reached
each other. As for us, even when we&#8217;re told, &#8217;This. This. It&#8217;s like this,&#8217; we still don&#8217;t
see. It&#8217;s like pointing out things to the blind &#8212; pitiful, when you think about
it.
<!--l. 69694--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, wherever I am, if I haven&#8217;t bowed down to Venerable Acariya
Mun, I can&#8217;t lie down to sleep, no matter where I am. Even if I&#8217;m about to
do walking meditation, I first face in his direction and pay him homage. If
there&#8217;s a picture of him as a conventional focus, I pay homage to his picture.
If there&#8217;s nothing, I take his virtues and form them into a convention to
which I pay respect. His virtues will never fade for me. It&#8217;s as if he hadn&#8217;t
passed away: a nature that stays like that, as if he were watching me all the
time.

<!--l. 69703--><p class="indent" >   This is why all the Noble Disciples who have seen the principles of the truth of
the Lord Buddha with their full hearts submit to him. That is, they submit to the
principles of the truth that are principles of nature; they don&#8217;t submit to his person
or anything like that. They submit in that the principles of the truth are now
the same for them and will never fade. No matter how far they may be
from him, that truth will never fade, because the truth is the same for all
of them. Even though the Buddha may have entered total nibbana more
than 2,500 years ago, this is not a problem that has an impact on the truth
appearing in our hearts. It&#8217;s simply the passage of conventional time or
of the body &#8212; that&#8217;s all &#8212; but the principle of that truth is unmoving:
always one who is pure. Whether alive or totally nibbana-ed, it&#8217;s one who is
pure.
<!--l. 69717--><p class="indent" >   This is a truth that is fixed. Those who know this principle of the truth all trust
it in the same way, because the true Buddha, the true Dhamma, and the true Sangha
lie in the heart. The heart truly pure is the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha in
full measure, untouched and undisturbed by time or place, unlike conventional
realities in general.
<!--l. 69724--><p class="indent" >   The Conventional Mind, The Mind Released
<!--l. 69726--><p class="indent" >   Once the mind has been well-cleansed so that it&#8217;s constantly radiant, then when
we&#8217;re in a quiet place, without any sounds &#8212; for instance, late in the still
of the night &#8212; even if the mind hasn&#8217;t gathered in concentration, we find
that when we focus on that center of awareness, it is so exceedingly delicate
and refined that it&#8217;s hard to describe. This refinement then becomes like a
radiance that spreads all around us in every direction. Nothing appears to be
making contact with the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and feeling
at that moment, even though the mind hasn&#8217;t gathered into the factors of
concentration. Instead, this is the firm foundation of the mind that has been
well-cleansed and displays a striking awareness, magnificence, and sensitivity within
itself.
<!--l. 69739--><p class="indent" >   With this type of awareness, it&#8217;s as if we weren&#8217;t dwelling in a body at all.
This is a very refined awareness, pronounced within itself. Even though the
mind hasn&#8217;t gathered in concentration, still &#8212; because of the refinement
of the mind, because of the pronounced nature of the mind &#8212; it becomes
a pronounced awareness, without any visions or images appearing at all.
This awareness is preeminent exclusively in itself. This is one stage of the
mind.
<!--l. 69747--><p class="indent" >   Another stage is when this well-cleansed mind gathers into stillness, not thinking,
not forming any thoughts at all. It rests from its activity &#8212; its rippling. All
thought-formations within the mind rest completely. All that remains is
simple awareness &#8212; which is called the mind entering into stillness. Here even
more so, nothing appears at all. All that appears is awareness, as if it were
blanketing the entire cosmos &#8212; because the currents of the mind aren&#8217;t like the
currents of light. The currents of light have their end, near or far, depending
on the strength of the light. For example, with electric light, if the candle
power is high, it will shine for a long distance. If low, it will shine for a short
distance.

<!--l. 69760--><p class="indent" >   But the currents of the mind aren&#8217;t like that. They have no &#8217;near&#8217; or &#8217;far.&#8217; To put
it simply, there is no time or place. The mind can blanket everything. Far is like near.
&#8217;Near,&#8217; &#8217;far&#8217;: They don&#8217;t really apply. All that appears is that awareness blanketing
everything to the ends of the universe. It&#8217;s as if all that appears in the entire world is
this single awareness, as if there were nothing in our consciousness at all, even though
everything still exists as it always has. This is what it&#8217;s like: the power of the mind,
the current of the mind that has been cleansed of things that cloud and obscure
it.
<!--l. 69770--><p class="indent" >   Even more so when the mind is completely pure: This is even harder to describe. I
wouldn&#8217;t know how to label it, because it&#8217;s not something to be labeled. It&#8217;s not
something that can be expressed like conventional things in general, because it&#8217;s
not a conventional reality. It lies solely within the range of those who are
non-conventional, who know their own non-conventionality. For this reason, it can&#8217;t
be described.
<!--l. 69777--><p class="indent" >   Now, the world is full of conventions. Whatever we say, we need to use a
conventional picture, a supposition, to make comparisons in every case. &#8217;It seems like
this. It seems like that.&#8217; Or, &#8217;It&#8217;s like this. It&#8217;s like that. It&#8217;s similar to that.&#8217; For
example, take the word, &#8217;nibbana.&#8217; Ordinary defilement &#8212; our ordinary mind &#8212;
requires that we think of nibbana as broad and spacious, with nothing appearing in
it. But we forget that the word nibbana, which is a conventional word, still has some
conventionality to it. We might even think that there&#8217;s nothing in nibbana but pure
people milling around &#8212; both men and women, because they both can reach purity:
Nibbana has nothing but those who are pure, milling around to and fro, or
sitting around in comfort and peace without being disturbed by sadness,
discontent, or loneliness as we are in our conventional world so full of turmoil and
stress.
<!--l. 69792--><p class="indent" >   Actually, we don&#8217;t realize that this picture &#8212; of pure men and women milling or
sitting around happily at their leisure without anything disturbing them &#8212; is simply
a convention that can&#8217;t have anything to do with the release of actual nibbana at all.
When we talk about things that are beyond the range of convention &#8212; even though
they may not be beyond the range of the speaker&#8217;s awareness, even though they may
be well within that person&#8217;s range &#8212; they can&#8217;t be expressed in conventional
terms. Whatever is expressed is bound to be interpreted wrongly, because
ordinarily the mind is always ready to be wrong, or continues to be wrong within
itself. As soon as anything comes flashing out, we have to speculate and
guess in line with our incorrect and uncertain understanding &#8212; like Ven.
Yamaka saying to Ven. Sariputta that an arahant no longer exists after
death.
<!--l. 69807--><p class="indent" >   Ven. Yamaka was still an ordinary, run-of-the-mill person, but even though Ven.
Sariputta, who was an arahant, tried to explain things to him, he still wouldn&#8217;t
understand, until the Lord Buddha had to come and explain things himself. Even
then &#8212; if I&#8217;m not mistaken &#8212; Ven. Yamaka still didn&#8217;t understand in line with the
truth the Buddha explained to him. As I remember, the texts say that Ven. Yamaka
didn&#8217;t attain any of the paths and fruitions or nibbana or anything. Still,
there must have been a reason for the Buddha&#8217;s explanation. If there were
nothing to be gained by teaching, the Buddha wouldn&#8217;t teach. In some cases,

even when the person being taught didn&#8217;t benefit much from the Dhamma,
other people involved would. This is one of the traits of the Lord Buddha.
There had to be a reason for everything he&#8217;d say. If there was something that
would benefit his listeners, he&#8217;d speak. If not, he wouldn&#8217;t. This is the nature
of the Buddha: fully reasonable, fully accomplished in everything of every
sort. He wouldn&#8217;t make empty pronouncements in the way of the rest of the
world.
<!--l. 69825--><p class="indent" >   So when he spoke to Ven. Yamaka, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve forgotten the details 4 &#8212;
because it&#8217;s been so long since I read it &#8212; to the point where I&#8217;ve forgotten who
benefited on that occasion, or maybe Ven. Yamaka did benefit. I&#8217;m not really sure.
At any rate, let&#8217;s focus on the statement, &#8217;An arahant doesn&#8217;t exist after death,&#8217; as
the important point.
<!--l. 69832--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha asked, &#8217;Is the arahant his body, so that when he dies he is
annihilated with the body? Is he vedana? Sañña? Sankhara? Viññana? Is he earth,
water, wind, or fire, so that when he dies he&#8217;s annihilated with these things?&#8217; He kept
asking in this way, until he reached the conclusion that the body is inconstant
and so disbands. Vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana are inconstant and
so disband. Whatever is a matter of convention follows these conventional
ways.
<!--l. 69840--><p class="indent" >   But whatever is a matter of release &#8212; of purity &#8212; cannot be made to follow those
ways, because it is not the same sort of thing. To take release or a released mind
and confuse or compound it with the five khandhas, which are an affair of
conventional reality, is wrong. It can&#8217;t be done. The five khandhas are one level
of conventional reality; the ordinary mind is also a level of conventional
reality.
<!--l. 69847--><p class="indent" >   The refinement of the mind &#8212; so refined that it is marvelous even when there are
still things entangling it &#8212; displays its marvelousness in line with its level for us to
see clearly. Even more so when the things entangling it are entirely gone, the mind
becomes Dhamma. The Dhamma is the mind. The mind is Dhamma. The entire
Dhamma is the entire mind. The entire mind is the entire Dhamma. At this point, no
conventions can be supposed, because the mind is pure Dhamma. Even though such
people may still be alive, directing their khandhas, that nature stays that way in full
measure.
<!--l. 69857--><p class="indent" >   Their khandhas are khandhas just like ours. Their appearance, manners, and
traits appear in line with their characteristics, in line with the affairs of conventional
reality that appear in those ways, which is why these things cannot be mixed
together to become one with that nature. When the mind is released, the nature of
release is one thing; the world of the khandhas is another world entirely. Even though
the pure heart may dwell in the midst of the world of the khandhas, it is
still always a mind released. To call it a transcendent mind wouldn&#8217;t be
wrong, because it lies above conventional reality &#8212; above the elements and
khandhas.
<!--l. 69868--><p class="indent" >   The transcendent Dhamma is a Dhamma above the world. This is why people of
this sort can know the issue of connection in the mind. Once the mind is cleansed
stage by stage, they can see its beginning points and end points. They can see the
mind&#8217;s behavior, the direction towards which it tends most heavily, and whether

there is anything left that involves the mind or acts as a means of connection. These
things they know, and they know them clearly. When they know clearly, they find a
way to cut, to remove from the mind the things that lead to connection, step by
step.
<!--l. 69878--><p class="indent" >   When the defilements come thick and fast, there is total darkness in the mind.
When this happens, we don&#8217;t know what the mind is or what the things entangling it
are, and so we assume them to be one and the same. The things that come to
entangle the mind, and the mind itself, become mixed into one, so there&#8217;s no way to
know.
<!--l. 69884--><p class="indent" >   But once the mind is cleansed step by step, we come to know in stages until we
can know clearly exactly how much there is still remaining in the mind. Even
if there&#8217;s just a bit, we know there&#8217;s a bit, because the act of connection
lets us see plainly that, &#8217;This is the seed that will cause us to be reborn in
one place or another.&#8217; We can tell this clearly within the mind. When we
know this clearly, we have to try to rectify the situation, using the various
methods of mindfulness and discernment until that thing is cut away from the
mind with no more connections. The mind will then become an entirely
pure mind, with no more means of connection or continuation. We can see
this clearly. This is the one who is released. This is the one who doesn&#8217;t
die.
<!--l. 69897--><p class="indent" >   Our Lord Buddha &#8212; from having practiced truly, from having truly known in
line with the principles of the truth, seeing them clearly in the heart &#8212;
spoke truly, acted truly, and knew truly. He taught what he had truly known
and truly seen &#8212; and so how could he be wrong? At first, he didn&#8217;t know
how many times he had been born, or what various things he had been
born as. Even concerning the present, he didn&#8217;t know what his mind was
attached to or involved with, because he had many, many defilements at that
stage.
<!--l. 69907--><p class="indent" >   But after he had striven and gained Awakening, so that the entire Dhamma
appeared in his heart, he knew clearly. When he knew clearly, he took that truth to
proclaim the Dhamma to the world and with intuitive insight knew who would be
able to comprehend this sort of Dhamma quickly, as when he knew that the
two hermits and the five brethren were already in a position to attain the
Dhamma. He then went to teach the five brethren and attained the aim he
foresaw.
<!--l. 69915--><p class="indent" >   All five of them attained the Dhamma stage by stage to the level of arahantship.
Since the Buddha was teaching the truth to those aiming at the truth with
their full hearts, they were able to communicate easily. They, looking for
the truth, and he, teaching the truth, were right for each other. When he
taught in line with the principles of the truth, they were able to comprehend
quickly and to know step by step following him until they penetrated the
truth clear through. Their defilements, however many or few they had, all
dissolved completely away. The cycle of rebirth was overturned to their complete
relief.
<!--l. 69925--><p class="indent" >   This is how it is when a person who truly knows and truly sees explains the
Dhamma. Whether it&#8217;s an aspect of the Dhamma dealing with the world or

with the Dhamma itself, what he says is bound to be certain because he
has seen it directly with his own eyes, heard it with his own ears, touched
it with his own heart. So when he remembers it and teaches it, how can
he be wrong? He can&#8217;t be wrong. For example, the taste of salt: Once we
have known with our tongue that it&#8217;s salty and we speak directly from the
saltiness of the salt, how can we be wrong? Or the taste of hot peppers: The
pepper is hot. It touches our tongue and we know, &#8217;This pepper is hot.&#8217; When
we speak with the truth &#8212; &#8217;This pepper is hot&#8217; &#8212; just where can we be
wrong?
<!--l. 69938--><p class="indent" >   So it is with knowing the Dhamma. When we practice to the stage where we
should know, we have to know, step by step. Knowing the Dhamma happens at the
same moment as abandoning defilement. When defilement dissolves away, the
brightness that has been obscured will appear in that very instant. The truth appears
clearly. Defilement, which is a truth, we know clearly. We then cut it away with the
path &#8212; mindfulness and discernment &#8212; which is a principle of the truth, and then
we take the truth and teach it so that those who are intent on listening will be sure
to understand.
<!--l. 69948--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught the Dhamma in 84,000 sections (khandha), but they aren&#8217;t in
excess of our five khandhas with the mind in charge, responsible for good and evil
and for dealing with everything that makes contact. Even though there may
be as many as 84,000 sections to the Dhamma, they were taught in line
with the attributes of the mind, of defilement, and of the Dhamma itself for
the sake of living beings with their differing temperaments. The Buddha
taught extensively &#8212; 84,000 sections of the Dhamma &#8212; so that those of
differing temperaments could put them into practice and straighten out their
defilements.
<!--l. 69959--><p class="indent" >   And we should make ourselves realize that those who listen to the Dhamma from
those who have truly known and truly seen &#8212; from the mouth of the Buddha, the
arahants, or meditation masters &#8212; should be able to straighten out their defilements
and mental effluents at the same time they are listening. This is a point that doesn&#8217;t
depend on time or place.
<!--l. 69966--><p class="indent" >   All the Dhamma comes down to the mind. The mind is a highly appropriate
vessel for each level of the Dhamma. In teaching the Dhamma, what are the things
entangling and embroiling the mind that are necessary to describe so that those who
listen can understand and let go? There are elements, khandhas, and the unlimited
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations outside us, which make contact
with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and heart within us. Thus it is necessary to
teach both about things outside and about things inside, because the mind can
become deluded and attached both outside and inside. It can love and hate both the
outside and the inside.
<!--l. 69977--><p class="indent" >   When we teach in line with the causes and effects both inside and out, in
accordance with the principles of the truth, the mind that contemplates or
investigates exclusively in line with the principles of truth has to know, step by step,
and be able to let go. Once we know something, we can let it go. That puts an end to
our problem of having to prove or investigate the matter again. Whatever we
understand is no longer a problem because once we have understood, we let go. We

keep letting go, because our understanding has reached the truth of those various
things in full measure.
<!--l. 69987--><p class="indent" >   The investigation of the Dhamma, on the levels in which it should be narrow, has
to be narrow. On the levels in which it should be wide-ranging, it has to be
wide-ranging in line with the full level of the mind and the Dhamma. So when the
heart of the meditator should stay in a restricted range, it has to be kept in that
range. For example, in the beginning stages of the training, the mind is filled with
nothing but cloudiness and confusion at all times and can&#8217;t find any peace or
contentment. We thus have to force it to stay in a restricted range &#8212; for example,
with the meditation word, &#8217;buddho,&#8217; or with the in-and-out breath &#8212; so
as to gain a footing with its meditation theme, so that stillness can form
a basis or a foundation for the heart, so that it can set itself up for the
practice that is to follow. We first have to teach the mind to withdraw itself
from its various preoccupations, using whichever meditation theme it finds
appealing, so that it can find a place of rest and relaxation through the
stillness.
<!--l. 70004--><p class="indent" >   Once we have obtained enough stillness from our meditation theme to form an
opening onto the way, we begin to investigate. Discernment and awareness begin to
branch out in stages or to widen their scope until they have no limit. When
we reach an appropriate time to rest the mind through the development
of concentration, we focus on tranquillity using our meditation theme as
we have done before, without having to pay attention to discernment in
any way at that moment. We set our sights on giving rise to stillness with
the meditation theme that has previously been coupled with the heart or
that we have previously practiced for the sake of stillness. We focus in on
that theme step by step with mindfulness in charge until stillness appears,
giving peace and contentment. This is called resting the mind by developing
concentration.
<!--l. 70018--><p class="indent" >   When the mind withdraws from its resting place, discernment has to unravel and
investigate things. Let it investigate whatever it should at that particular time or
stage, until it understands the matter. When discernment begins to move into action
as a result of its being reinforced by the strength of concentration, its investigations
have to grow more and more wide-ranging, step by step. This is where discernment is
wide-ranging. This is where the Dhamma is wide-ranging. The more resourceful our
discernment, the more its investigations spread until it knows the causes
and effects of phenomena as they truly are. Its doubts then disappear, and
it lets go in stages, in line with the levels of mindfulness and discernment
suited to removing the various kinds of defilement step by step from the
heart.
<!--l. 70031--><p class="indent" >   The mind then gradually retreats into a more restricted range, as it sees
necessary, all on its own without needing to be forced as before &#8212; because once it
has investigated and known in line with the way things really are, what is there left
to be entangled with? To be concerned about? The extent to which it is concerned or
troubled is because of its lack of understanding. When it understands with the
discernment that investigates and unravels to see the truth of each particular thing,
the mind withdraws and lets go of its concerns. It goes further and further

inward until its scope grows more and more restricted &#8212; to the elements,
the khandhas, and then exclusively to the mind itself. At this stage, the
mind works in a restricted scope because it has cut away its burdens in
stages.
<!--l. 70044--><p class="indent" >   What is there in the elements and the khandhas? Analyze them down into their
parts &#8212; body, feelings, sañña, sankhara, and viññana &#8212; until you have removed your
doubts about any one of them. For example, when you investigate the body, an
understanding of feeling automatically follows. Or when you investigate
feelings, this leads straight to the body, to sañña, sankhara, and viññana,
which have the same sorts of characteristics &#8212; because they come from the
same current of the mind. To put it briefly, the Buddha taught that each
of the five khandhas is a complete treasury or complete heap of the three
characteristics.
<!--l. 70055--><p class="indent" >   What do they have that&#8217;s worth holding on to? The physical elements, the
physical heap, all physical forms, are simply heaps of the elements. Vedana, sañña,
sankhara, and viññana are all mere mental phenomena. They appear &#8212;
blip, blip, blip &#8212; and disappear in an instant. What value or substance
can you get from them? Discernment penetrates further and further in. It
knows the truth, which goes straight to the heart, and it lets go with that
straight-to-the-heart knowledge. In other words, it lets go straight from the
heart. When the knowledge goes straight to the heart, it lets go straight
from the heart. Our job narrows in, narrows in, as the work of discernment
dictates.
<!--l. 70067--><p class="indent" >   This is the way it is when investigating and knowing the path of the mind that
involves itself with various preoccupations. We come in knowing, we come in letting
go step by step, cutting off the paths of the tigers that used to roam about looking
for food &#8212; as in the phrase from the Dhamma textbooks: &#8217;Cutting off the
paths of the tigers that roam about looking for food.&#8217; We cut them out
from the paths of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body along which they
used to roam, involving themselves with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and
tactile sensations, gathering up poisonous food and bringing it in to burn the
heart.
<!--l. 70078--><p class="indent" >   Discernment thus has to roam about investigating the body, feelings, sañña,
sankhara, and viññana by probing inward, probing inward along the paths that the
tigers and leopards like to follow, so as to cut off the paths along which they used to
go looking for food. The Buddha teaches us to probe inward, cutting off the paths
until we have the tigers caged. In other words, unawareness, which is like a tiger,
converges in at the one mind. All defilements and mental effluents converge in at the
one mind. They can&#8217;t go out roaming freely looking for food as they did
before.
<!--l. 70088--><p class="indent" >   The mind of unawareness: You could say that it&#8217;s like a football, because
discernment unravels it &#8212; stomps on it, kicks it back and forth &#8212; until it is smashed
to bits: until the defilement of unawareness is smashed inside. This is the
level of the mind where defilement converges, so when discernment unravels
it, it&#8217;s just like a football that is stomped and kicked. It gets kicked back
and forth among the khandhas until it&#8217;s smashed apart by discernment.

When the conventional mind is smashed apart, the mind released is fully
revealed.
<!--l. 70098--><p class="indent" >   Why do we say the &#8217;conventional mind&#8217; and the &#8217;mind released&#8217;? Do they become
two separate minds? Not at all. It&#8217;s still the same mind. When conventional realities
&#8212; defilements and mental effluents &#8212; rule it, that&#8217;s one state of the mind; but when
it&#8217;s washed and wrung out by discernment until that state of mind is smashed apart,
then the true mind, the true Dhamma, which can stand the test, doesn&#8217;t disappear
with it. The only things that disappear are the things inconstant, stressful, and
not-self that had infiltrated the mind &#8212; because defilements and mental effluents,
no matter how refined, are simply conventions: inconstant, stressful, and
not-self.
<!--l. 70109--><p class="indent" >   When these things disappear, the true mind, above and beyond convention, can
then appear to its full extent. This is what&#8217;s called the mind released. This is what&#8217;s
called the pure mind, completely cut off from all connections and continuations. All
that remains is simple awareness, utterly pure.
<!--l. 70115--><p class="indent" >   We can&#8217;t say at what point in our body this simple awareness is centered. Before,
it was a prominent point that we could know and see clearly. For example, in
concentration we knew that it was centered in the middle of the chest. Our awareness
was pronounced right there. The stillness was pronounced right there. The
brightness, the radiance of the mind was pronounced right there. We could see it
clearly without having to ask anyone. All those whose minds have centered into the
foundation of concentration find that the center of &#8217;what knows&#8217; is really pronounced
right here in the middle of the chest. They won&#8217;t argue that it&#8217;s in the brain or
whatever, as those who have never experienced the practice of concentration are
always saying.
<!--l. 70127--><p class="indent" >   But when the mind becomes a pure mind, that center disappears, and so we can&#8217;t
say that the mind is above or below or in any particular spot, because it&#8217;s an
awareness that is pure, an awareness that is subtle and profound above and beyond
any and all conventions. Even so, we are still veering off into conventions when we
say that it&#8217;s &#8217;extremely refined,&#8217; which doesn&#8217;t really fit the truth, because
of course the notion of extreme refinement is a convention. We can&#8217;t say
that this awareness lies high or low, or where it has a point or a center &#8212;
because it doesn&#8217;t have one at all. All there is, is awareness with nothing else
infiltrating it. Even though it&#8217;s in the midst of the elements and khandhas with
which it used to be mixed, it&#8217;s not that way any more. It now lies world
apart.
<!--l. 70140--><p class="indent" >   We now can know clearly that the khandhas are khandhas, the mind is the
mind, the body is the body; vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana are each
separate khandhas. But as for feelings in that mind, they no longer exist,
ever since the mind gained release from all defilement. Therefore the three
characteristics, which are convention incarnate, don&#8217;t exist in that mind. The
mind doesn&#8217;t partake of feeling, apart from the ultimate ease (paramam
sukham) that is its own nature &#8212; and the ultimate ease here is not a feeling of
ease.
<!--l. 70149--><p class="indent" >   When the Buddha teaches that nibbana is the ultimate ease, the term &#8217;ultimate
ease&#8217; is not a feeling of ease like the feelings or moods of the mind still defiled, or the

feelings of the body that are constantly appearing as stress and ease. The
ultimate ease is not a feeling like that. Those who practice should take this
point to heart and practice so as to know it for themselves. That will be
the end of the question, in line with the Dhamma that the Buddha says is
sanditthiko &#8212; to be seen for oneself &#8212; and on which he lays no exclusive
claims.
<!--l. 70159--><p class="indent" >   Thus we cannot say that the mind absolutely pure has any feeling. This mind has
no feeling. The term &#8217;ultimate ease&#8217; refers to an ease by the very nature of purity,
and so there can&#8217;t be anything inconstant, stressful, or not-self found infiltrating that
ultimate ease at all.
<!--l. 70164--><p class="indent" >   Nibbana is constant. The ultimate ease is constant. They are one and the same.
The Buddha says that nibbana is constant, the ultimate ease is constant, the
ultimate void is constant. They&#8217;re all the same thing &#8212; but the void of nibbana
lies beyond convention. It&#8217;s not void in the way the world supposes it to
be.
<!--l. 70170--><p class="indent" >   If we know clearly, we can describe and analyze anything at all. If we don&#8217;t
understand, we can talk from morning till night and be wrong from morning till
night. There is no way we can be right, because the mind isn&#8217;t right. No matter how
much we may speak in line with what we understand to be right in accordance with
the Dhamma, if the mind that is acting isn&#8217;t right, how can we be right? It&#8217;s as if we
were to say, &#8217;Nibbana is the ultimate ease; nibbana is the ultimate void,&#8217; to the point
where the words are always in our mouth and in our heart: If the mind is a mind
with defilements, it can&#8217;t be right. When the mind isn&#8217;t right, nothing can be
right.
<!--l. 70181--><p class="indent" >   Once the mind is right, though, then even when we don&#8217;t say anything, we&#8217;re
right &#8212; because that nature is already right. Whether or not we speak, we&#8217;re right.
Once we reach the level where we&#8217;re right, there&#8217;s no wrong. This is the marvel that
comes from the practice of the religion.
<!--l. 70187--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught only as far as this level and didn&#8217;t teach anything further. It&#8217;s
in every way the end of conventions, the end of formulations, the end of defilement,
the end of suffering and stress. This is why he didn&#8217;t teach anything further, because
this is the point at which he fully aimed: the full level of the mind and of the
Dhamma.
<!--l. 70193--><p class="indent" >   Before he totally entered nibbana, his last instructions were, &#8217;Monks,
I exhort you. Formations are constantly arising and ceasing. Investigate
formations that are arising and disbanding, or arising and ceasing, with
non-complacency.&#8217;
<!--l. 70198--><p class="indent" >   That was all. He closed his mouth and never said anything again.
<!--l. 70200--><p class="indent" >   In this teaching, which has the rank of a final instruction, how should we
understand or interpret the word &#8217;formation&#8217; (sankhara)? What kind of formations
does it refer to? We could take it as referring to outer formations or inner formations
and we wouldn&#8217;t be wrong. But at that moment, we can be fairly certain that those
who had come to listen to the Buddha&#8217;s final instructions at the final hour
were practicing monks with high levels of mental attainment, from arahants
on down. So I would think that the main point to which the Buddha was
referring was inner formations that form thoughts in the mind and disrupt

the mind at all times. He taught to investigate the arising and ceasing of
these formations with non-complacency &#8212; in other words, to investigate
with mindfulness and discernment at all times. These formations cover the
cosmos!
<!--l. 70214--><p class="indent" >   We could, if we wanted to, analyze the word &#8217;formations&#8217; as outer formations &#8212;
trees, mountains, animals, people &#8212; but this wouldn&#8217;t be in keeping with the level of
the monks gathered there, nor would it be in keeping with the occasion: the Buddha&#8217;s
last moments before total nibbana in which he gave his exhortation to the Sangha:
the ultimate teaching at the final hour.
<!--l. 70221--><p class="indent" >   His final exhortation dealing with formations, given as he was about to enter total
nibbana, must thus refer specifically to the most refined formations in the heart.
Once we comprehend these inner formations, how can we help but understand their
basis &#8212; what they arise from. We&#8217;ll have to penetrate into the well-spring of the
cycle of rebirth: the mind of unawareness. This is the way to penetrate to the
important point. Those who have reached this level have to know this. Those who
are approaching it in stages, who haven&#8217;t fully reached it, still know this
clearly because they are investigating the matter, which is what the Buddha&#8217;s
instructions &#8212; given in the midst of that important stage of events &#8212; were all
about.
<!--l. 70234--><p class="indent" >   This, I think, would be in keeping with the occasion in which the Buddha spoke.
Why? Because ordinarily when the mind has investigated to higher and higher levels,
these inner formations &#8212; the various thoughts that form in the mind &#8212; are very
crucial to the investigation because they appear day and night, and are at work every
moment inside the mind. A mind reaching the level where it should investigate
inner phenomena must thus take these inner formations as the focal point
of its investigation. This is a matter directly related to the Buddha&#8217;s final
instructions.
<!--l. 70244--><p class="indent" >   The ability to overthrow unawareness must follow on an investigation focused
primarily on inner formations. Once we have focused in, focused in, down to the root
of defilement and have then destroyed it, these formations no longer play any role in
giving rise to defilement again. Their only function is to serve the purposes of the
Dhamma. We use them to formulate Dhamma for the benefit of the world. In
teaching Dhamma we have to use thought-formations, and so formations of this sort
become tools of the Dhamma.
<!--l. 70253--><p class="indent" >   Now that we have given the khandhas a new ruler, the thought-formations which
were forced into service by unawareness have now become tools of the Dhamma &#8212;
tools of a pure heart. The Buddha used these thought-formations to teach the world,
to formulate various expressions of the Dhamma.
<!--l. 70259--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma we have mentioned here doesn&#8217;t exist solely in the past, in the time
of the Buddha, or solely in the future in a way that would deny hope to whose who
practice rightly and properly. It lies among our own khandhas and mind, in our
body and mind. It doesn&#8217;t lie anywhere else other than in the bodies and
minds of human beings, women and men. The defilements, the path, and
purity all lie right here in the heart. They don&#8217;t lie in that time or period
way back when, or with that person or this. They lie with the person who
practices, who is using mindfulness and discernment to investigate right

now.
<!--l. 70269--><p class="indent" >   Why? Because we are all aiming at the Dhamma. We are aiming at the truth, just
like the Dhamma, the truth, that the Buddha taught then and that always
holds to the principle of being &#8217;majjhima&#8217; &#8212; in the center &#8212; not leaning
toward that time or this, not leaning toward that period or this place. It&#8217;s a
Dhamma always keeping to an even keel because it lies in the center of our
elements and khandhas.Majjhima: in the center, or always just right for curing
defilement.
<!--l. 70278--><p class="indent" >   So please practice correctly in line with this Dhamma. You will see the results of
&#8217;majjhima&#8217; &#8212; a Dhamma just right, always and everywhere &#8212; appearing as I have
said. Nibbana, the ultimate ease, will not in any way lie beyond this knowing
heart.
<!--l. 70283--><p class="indent" >   And so I&#8217;ll ask to stop here.
<!--l. 70285--><p class="indent" >   Postscript
<!--l. 70287--><p class="indent" >   An excerpt from a letter written by Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa to Mrs. Pow
Phanga Vathanakul, dated February 26, 1976.
<!--l. 70290--><p class="indent" >   The practice of the Dhamma in keeping with the Dhamma that he gave with
utter compassion unequaled by that of anyone else in the world: This is the true
homage to the Buddha. The seeing of the truth that lies within you, using
discernment step by step at all times: This is the seeing of the Buddha step by step.
The seeing of the truth with the full heart using discernment: This is the seeing of
the Buddha in full. The true Buddha, the true Dhamma, lie with the heart. To
attend to your own heart is to attend to the Buddha. To watch over your own heart
with mindfulness and discernment is truly to see the Buddha, Dhamma, and
Sangha.
<!--l. 70301--><p class="indent" >   The king of death warns and assaults the bodies of the world&#8217;s living beings in
line with the principles of his truth. You have to greet his warnings and assaults
with mindfulness, discernment, conviction, and unflagging persistence, and
take out your treasures &#8212; the paths, fruitions, and nibbana &#8212; to flaunt
in his face, braving death in the course of persistent effort. You and he,
who have regarded each other as enemies for such a long time, will then
become true friends &#8212; neither of you to take advantage of the other ever
again.
<!--l. 70311--><p class="indent" >   The body and the khandhas are things that the world must relinquish in spite of
its regrets. You should relinquish them with mindfulness and discernment before the
time comes to relinquish them in the way of the world. This is the supreme
letting-go, second to nothing.
<!--l. 70316--><p class="indent" >   Please take this to heart, because it is written straight from the heart.

<!--l. 70321--><p class="indent" >   Glossary
<!--l. 70323--><p class="indent" >   Acariya:Teacher; mentor.Anatta:Not-self; ownerless.Aniccam:Inconstant;
unsteady; impermanent.Arahant:A person whose heart is free of mental effluents (see
asava) and who is thus not destined for future rebirth. An epithet for the Buddha
and the highest level of his Noble Disciples.arammana:Preoccupation; mental
object.Asava:Mental effluent, pollutant, or fermentation &#8212; sensuality, states of being,
views, and unawareness.Avijja:Unawareness; ignorance; obscured awareness; delusion

about the nature of the mind.Ayatana:Sense medium. The inner sense media are the
sense organs &#8212; eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The outer sense media are
their respective objects.Brahma:&#8217;Great One&#8217; &#8212; an inhabitant of the heavens of form
or formlessness.Brahman:Used in the Buddha sense, this term is synonymous with
arahant.Buddho:Awake; enlightened. An epithet for the Buddha.Cetasika:Mental
concomitant (see vedana, sañña, and sankhara).Dhamma (dharma):Event;
phenomenon; the way things are in and of themselves; their inherent qualities; the
basic principles underlying their behavior. Also, principles of behavior that human
beings ought to follow so as to fit in with the right natural order of things;
qualities of mind they should develop so as to realize the inherent quality of
the mind in and of itself. By extension, &#8217;Dhamma&#8217; is used also to denote
any doctrine that teaches such things. Thus the Dhamma of the Buddha
denotes both his teachings and the direct experience of nibbana, the quality
at which those teachings are aimed.Dhatu:Element; property, impersonal
condition. The four physical elements or properties are earth (solidity), water
(liquidity), wind (motion), and fire (heat). The six elements include the above
four plus space and cognizance.Dukkha(m):Stress; suffering; pain; distress;
discontent.Evam:Thus; in this way. This term is used in Thailand as a formal closing
to a sermon.Kamma (karma):Intentional acts that result in states of being and
birth.Kayagata-sati:Mindfulness immersed in the body. This is a blanket term
covering several meditation themes: keeping the breath in mind; being mindful of
the body&#8217;s posture; being mindful of one&#8217;s activities; analyzing the body
into its parts; analyzing the body into its physical properties (see dhatu);
contemplating the fact that the body is inevitably subject to death and
disintegration.Khandha:Heap; group; aggregate. Physical and mental components of
the personality and of sensory experience in general (see rupa, vedana, sañña,
sankhara, and viññana).Kilesa:Defilement &#8212; passion, aversion, and delusion in their
various forms, which include such things as greed, malevolence, anger, rancor,
hypocrisy, arrogance, envy, miserliness, dishonesty, boastfulness, obstinacy,
violence, pride, conceit, intoxication, and complacency.Loka-dhamma:Worldly
phenomenon &#8212; fortune, loss of fortune, status, disgrace, praise, censure, pleasure,
and pain.Lokuttara:Transcendent; supramundane (see magga, phala, and
nibbana).Magga:Path. Specifically, the path to the cessation of suffering and stress.
The four transcendent paths &#8212; or rather, one path with four levels of refinement &#8212;
are the path to stream-entry (entering the stream to nibbana, which ensures that one
will be reborn at most only seven more times), the path to once-returning, the path
to non-returning, and the path to arahantship.Mara:Temptation; mortality
personified.Nibbana (nirvana):Liberation; the unbinding of the mind from mental
effluents, defilements, and the round of rebirth (see asava, kilesa, and vatta). As this
term is used to denote also the extinguishing of fire, it carries the connotations of
stilling, cooling, and peace. (According to the physics taught at the time of the
Buddha, a burning fire seizes or adheres to its fuel; when extinguished, it is
unbound.)Pañña:Discernment; insight; wisdom; intelligence; common sense;
ingenuity.Parami:Perfection of the character &#8212; generosity, virtue, renunciation,
discernment, persistence, forbearance, truthfulness, determination, good will, and
equanimity.Parisa:Following; assembly. The four groups of the Buddha&#8217;s following are

monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.Patimokkha:The basic code of 227 precepts
observed by Buddhist monks, chanted every half-month in each assembly of
monks numbering four or more.Phala:Fruition. Specifically, the fruition of any
of the four transcendent paths (see magga).Puñña:Merit; worth; the inner
sense of well-being that comes from having acted rightly or well.Rupa:Body;
physical phenomenon; sense datum.Sabhava-dhamma:Phenomenon; an event,
property, or quality as experienced in and of itself.Sallekha-dhamma:Topics of
effacement (effacing defilement) &#8212; having few wants, being content with what
one has, seclusion, uninvolvement in companionship, persistence, virtue,
concentration, discernment, release, and the direct knowing and seeing of
release.Samadhi:Concentration; the practice of centering the mind in a single
sensation or preoccupation.Sammati:Conventional reality; convention; relative truth;
supposition; anything conjured into being by the mind.Sanditthiko:Self-evident,
visible here and now.Sangha:The community of the Buddha&#8217;s disciples. On the
conventional level, this refers to the Buddhist monkhood. On the ideal level, it
refers to those of the Buddha&#8217;s followers, whether lay or ordained, who have
attained at least the first of the transcendent paths (see magga) culminating in
nibbana.Sankhara:Formation. This can denote anything formed or fashioned by
conditions, or &#8212; as one of the five khandhas &#8212; specifically thought-formations
within the mind.Sañña:Label; perception; allusion; act of memory or recognition;
interpretation.Sati:Mindfulness; alertness; self-collectedness; powers of reference and
retention.Satipatthana:Foundation of mindfulness; frame of reference &#8212;
body, feelings, mind, and mental events, viewed in and of themselves as they
occur.Sa-upadisesa-nibbana:Nibbana with fuel remaining (the analogy is to an
extinguished fire whose embers are still glowing) &#8212; liberation as experienced in this
lifetime by an arahant.Sugato:Well-faring; going (or gone) to a good destination. An
epithet for the Buddha.Tanha:Craving, the cause of stress, which takes three forms
&#8212; craving for sensuality, for being, and for not-being.Tathagata:One who has become
true. A title for the Buddha.Tilakkhana:Three characteristics inherent in all
conditioned phenomena &#8212; being inconstant, stressful, and not-self.Tipitaka
(tripitaka):The Buddhist Cannon; literally, the three &#8217;baskets&#8217; &#8212; disciplinary rules,
discourses, and abstract philosophical treatises.Uposatha:Observance day,
corresponding to the phases of the moon, on which Buddhist lay people
gather to listen to the Dhamma and to observe special precepts. Monks
assemble to hear the Patimokkha on the new-moon and full-moon uposatha
days.Vassa:Rains Retreat. A period from July to October, corresponding roughly to
the rainy season, in which each monk is required to live settled in a single place
and not wander freely about.Vatta:The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
This denotes both the death and rebirth of living beings and the death and
rebirth of defilement within the mind.Vedana:Feeling &#8212; pleasure (ease), pain
(stress), or neither pleasure nor pain.Vijja:Clear knowledge; genuine awareness;
science (specifically, the cognitive powers developed through the practice of
concentration and discernment).Vimutti:Release; freedom from the fabrications
and conventions of the mind.Vinaya:The disciplinary rules of the monastic
order.Viññana:Cognizance; consciousness; the act of taking note of sense data and
ideas as they occur.
