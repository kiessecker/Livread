lesser"), the fifth division of the Sutta Pitaka, is a wide-ranging collection of fifteen
books (eighteen in the Burmese Tipitaka) containing complete suttas, verses, and
smaller fragments of Dhamma teachings. While many of these have been treasured

English.

<!--l. 45027--><p class="indent" >   The Path of Discrimination (Patisambhidamagga) is the richest discourse by
Arahant Sariputta Thera on the Buddha&#8217;s Teachings in the questions-and-answers
format. A.K. Warder succinctly described the most important feature of this great
work by saying : "it expounds the way or path of &#8217;discrimination&#8217; in its various
aspects and tries to show exactly how understanding takes place in a practical sense,
not simply in theory."
<!--l. 45035--><p class="indent" >   The book consists of thirty treatises. They span the various kinds of
knowledges (associated with learning, virtue, concentration, dependent origination,
comprehension, rise &amp; fall of phenomena, dissolution, appearance of terror,

equanimity about formations, and so on), views, breathing meditation, the five
faculties, liberation, action (kamma), paths, truths, lovingkindness, powers, voidness,
foundations of mindfulness, insight, and so on.

Questions of MilindaThis collection of sutta-like passages recounts a long series of
dialogues concerning profound points of Dhamma between the arahant Ven.
Nagasena and the Bactrian Greek king Milinda (Menander). The king, a
philosopher and skilled debater, poses to Ven. Nagasena one question after
another concerning the Dhamma, each of which Ven. Nagasena masterfully
answers, often with unusually vivid and apt similes. Like so many stories from
the Pali canon, this one has a happy ending: the king is so deeply inspired
by Ven. Nagasena&#8217;s wisdom that he converts to Buddhism, hands over his
kingdom to his son, joins the Sangha, and eventually becomes an arahant
himself.
<!--l. 45091--><p class="indent" >   The Milindapa姻a has long been revered by Theravada Buddhists around the
world because it addresses many questions of Buddhist doctrine of the sort that often
come up in the course of Dhamma study and meditation practice: "Are pleasant

feelings skillful or unskillful?" "What is the difference between someone
with attachment and someone without?" "Can an arahant ever break a
Vinaya rule?" "Is it better to perform an unwholesome act knowingly or
unknowingly?" "How far away is the Brahma-world?" "Why are some people
healthy and others ill; some people attractive and others ugly; some rich, and
others poor?" All told, the king asks some 237 questions1 along these lines,
making this one of the most comprehensive and useful Buddhist FAQs2 in
existence.
