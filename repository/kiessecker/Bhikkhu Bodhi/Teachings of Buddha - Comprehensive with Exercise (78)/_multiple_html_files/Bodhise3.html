<!--l. 5114--><p class="indent" >   These anthologies on particular topics are designed as aids for individual or group
study. The texts are drawn from the Pali canon, teachings of the great Thai forest
ajaans, and other sources. Unless otherwise indicated, they were prepared and
introduced by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.
<!--l. 5119--><p class="indent" >   Beyond Coping: The Buddha&#8217;s Teachings on Aging, Illness, Death, and
Separation
<!--l. 5122--><p class="indent" >   Body Contemplation: An overview of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings on contemplation of
the body, and its role in the development of mindfulness, jhana, and discernment.
<!--l. 5126--><p class="indent" >   The Five Aggregates: This anthology of short readings from the suttas explains
how the teachings on the five aggregates (pañcakkhandha) &#8212; form, feeling,
perception, mental fabrications, and consciousness &#8212; function in the Buddhist path
to liberation.
<!--l. 5131--><p class="indent" >   The Four Noble Truths: An introduction to the Four Noble Truths, the basic
framework on which all the Buddha&#8217;s teachings are built.
<!--l. 5134--><p class="indent" >   Kamma: An overview of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings on kamma (karma; intentional
action).
<!--l. 5137--><p class="indent" >   Merit: Often misunderstood in the West as quaint and irrelevant to serious
practice, the Buddha&#8217;s teachings on puñña (merit) actually play an essential role in
the development of a wise sense of self. This anthology explores the meaning of merit
and how it functions to instill in the practitioner the qualities necessary to carry him
or her to stream-entry and beyond.
<!--l. 5144--><p class="indent" >   Noble Conversation: An exploration of right speech, based on the Buddha&#8217;s list of
ten ideal topics for conversation.
<!--l. 5147--><p class="indent" >   Non-violence.
<!--l. 5149--><p class="indent" >   Recognizing the Dhamma
<!--l. 5151--><p class="indent" >   In an age when the marketplace is teeming with spiritual books and teachings of
every description, it is reassuring to know that the Buddha left behind clear
guidelines by which we can judge the validity of a spiritual teaching. These eight
principles, sometimes called the "Constitution of Buddhism," show us that any
teaching must finally be judged by the results that come from putting it into
practice.
<!--l. 5159--><p class="indent" >   Stream-entry: "Stream-entry" (sotapatti) is the first of the four stages of
Awakening. This study guide is in two parts: Part 1: The Way to Stream-entry. Sutta
readings in this guide are organized around the four factors that lead to the
attainment of stream-entry and address questions of interest to all meditators,
whether or not their practice aims all the way to Awakening.

<!--l. 5166--><p class="indent" >   Part 2: Stream-entry and After. Selections from the Canon that explore
stream-entry from several angles: How is stream-entry experienced? What
transformations of mind and character occur as a result? What are its rewards? Once
it is attained, what next? Also included is some helpful advice to meditators who
have been "certified" as stream-winners.
<!--l. 5173--><p class="indent" >   The Ten Perfections: The ten paramis (perfections) are skillful qualities that
develop &#8212; perhaps over many lifetimes &#8212; as one follows the Buddha&#8217;s path of
practice. This study guide includes readings both from the Pali canon and from the
teachings of Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo.
<!--l. 5179--><p class="indent" >   The Ten Recollections: The ten anussati (recollections) are a set of practical tools
for meditators to use when confronted with particular challenges (physical pain,
for example) or unskillful states of mind (doubt, restlessness, complacency,
etc.).

<!--l. 5235--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 5237--><p class="indent" >   An anthropologist once questioned an Eskimo shaman about his tribe&#8217;s belief
system. After putting up with the anthropologist&#8217;s questions for a while, the shaman
finally told him: "Look. We don&#8217;t believe. We fear."

<!--l. 5242--><p class="indent" >   In a similar way, Buddhism starts, not with a belief, but with a fear of very
present dangers. As the Buddha himself reported, his initial impetus for leaving home
and seeking Awakening was his comprehension of the great dangers that inevitably
follow on birth: aging, illness, death, and separation. The Awakening he sought was
one that would lead him to a happiness not subject to these things. After
finding that happiness, and in attempting to show others how to find it for
themselves, he frequently referred to the themes of aging, illness, death, and
separation as useful objects for contemplation. Because of this, his teaching has
often been called pessimistic, but this emphasis is actually like that of a
doctor who focuses on the symptoms and causes of disease as part of an
effort to bring about a cure. The Buddha is not afraid to dwell on these
topics, because the Awakening he teaches brings about a total release from
them.
<!--l. 5257--><p class="indent" >   This study guide provides an introduction to the Buddha&#8217;s teachings on aging,
illness, death, and separation. The passages included here &#8212; all taken from the Pali
canon &#8212; are arranged in five sections.
<!--l. 5262--><p class="indent" >   The first section presents medical metaphors for the teaching, showing how the
Buddha was like a doctor and how his teaching is like a course of therapy offering a
cure for the great dangers in life.
<!--l. 5266--><p class="indent" >   The second section diagnoses the problems of aging, illness, death, and
separation. This section touches briefly on the Buddha&#8217;s central teaching, the four
noble truths. For more information on this subject, see The Path to Freedom and the
study guide, The Four Noble Truths.
<!--l. 5271--><p class="indent" >   The third section contains passages that use aging, illness, death, and separation,
as reminders for diligence in the practice. The central passage here is a set of five
recollections, in which recollection of aging, illness, death, and separation
forms a background for a fifth recollection: the power of one&#8217;s actions to
shape one&#8217;s experience. In other words, the first four recollections present the
dangers of life; the fifth indicates the way in which those dangers may be
overcome, through developing skill in one&#8217;s own thoughts, words, and deeds.
Useful articles to read in conjunction with this section are Affirming the
Truths of the Heart, Karma, and The Road to Nirvana is Paved with Skillful
Intentions.
<!--l. 5283--><p class="indent" >   The fourth section contains passages that give specific advice on how to deal with
problems of aging, etc. The Buddha&#8217;s teachings on kamma provide an important
underpinning for how problems of pain and illness are approached in this section.
Given the fact that the experience of the present moment is shaped both by past and
by present intentions, it is possible that &#8212; if an illness is the result of present
intentions &#8212; a change of mind can effect a cure in the illness; but if the illness is the
result of past intentions, a change of mind may have no effect on the illness but can
at least protect the mind from being adversely affected by it. Thus some of the
passages focus how practicing the Dhamma can cure a person of illness,
whereas others focus on how the Dhamma can ensure that, even though
a person may die from an illness, the illness will make no inroads on the
mind.
<!--l. 5297--><p class="indent" >   The fifth section gives examples of how the Buddha and his disciples skillfully

negotiated the problems of aging, illness, death, and separation.

a brahman, responsive to requests, open-handed, bearing my last body, an
unsurpassed doctor &amp; surgeon. You are my children, my sons, born from my mouth,

<!--l. 5338--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; SN 22.86
<!--l. 5340--><p class="indent" >   §3. Once the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa forest. Then,
picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand, he asked the monks, "What do you
think, monks: Which are more numerous, the few Simsapa leaves in my hand or those
overhead in the Simsapa forest?"
<!--l. 5346--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;The leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number, lord. Those
overhead in the forest are far more numerous."
<!--l. 5349--><p class="indent" >   "In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge
but have not taught are far more numerous [than what I have taught]. And why
haven&#8217;t I taught them? Because they are not connected with the goal, do not relate
to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to
cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That is why
I have not taught them.

Because they are connected with the goal, relate to the rudiments of the holy

<!--l. 5373--><p class="indent" >   §4. Then the monks went to Ven. Sariputta. On arrival, they exchanged
courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp;
courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to
Ven. Sariputta, "Friend Sariputta, we want to go to the countryside of the
outlying districts and to take up residence there. We have already informed the
Teacher."
<!--l. 5380--><p class="indent" >   "Friends, in foreign lands there are wise nobles &amp; priests, householders &amp;

well to the teachings &#8212; grasped them well, attended to them well, considered them
well, penetrated them well by means of discernment &#8212; so that in answering you will
speak in line with what the Blessed One has said, will not misrepresent the Blessed
One with what is unfactual, will answer in line with the Dhamma, and no one
whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing
you?"
<!--l. 5392--><p class="indent" >   "We would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in
Ven. Sariputta&#8217;s presence. It would be good if Ven. Sariputta himself would enlighten
us as to their meaning."
<!--l. 5396--><p class="indent" >   "Then in that case, friends, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."

<!--l. 6008--><p class="indent" >   §10. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi, in Jeta&#8217;s
Grove, Anathapindika&#8217;s monastery. Then Rohitassa, the son of a deva, in the
far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of
Jeta&#8217;s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the
Blessed One, he stood to one side. As he was standing there he said to the
Blessed One: "Is it possible, lord, by traveling, to know or see or reach a far
end of the cosmos where one does not take birth, age, die, pass away or
reappear?"
<!--l. 6017--><p class="indent" >   "I tell you, friend, that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far
end of the cosmos where one does not take birth, age, die, pass away, or
reappear."
<!--l. 6021--><p class="indent" >   "It is amazing, lord, and awesome, how well that has been said by the Blessed
One: &#8217;I tell you, friend, that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a
far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth, age, die, pass away,
or reappear.&#8217; Once I was a seer named Rohitassa, a student of Bhoja, a
powerful sky-walker. My speed was as fast as that of a strong archer &#8212;
well-trained, a practiced hand, a practiced sharp-shooter &#8212; shooting a light
arrow across the shadow of a palm tree. My stride stretched as far as the
east sea is from the west. To me, endowed with such speed, such a stride,
there came the desire: &#8217;I will go traveling to the end of the cosmos.&#8217; I &#8212;
with a one-hundred year life, a one-hundred year span &#8212; spent one hundred
years traveling &#8212; apart from the time spent on eating, drinking, chewing &amp;
tasting, urinating &amp; defecating, and sleeping to fight off weariness &#8212; but
without reaching the end of the cosmos I died along the way. So it is amazing,
lord, and awesome, how well that has been said by the Blessed One: &#8217;I tell
you, friend, that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far
end of the cosmos where one does not take birth, age, die, pass away, or
reappear.&#8217;"
<!--l. 6042--><p class="indent" >   [When this was said, the Blessed One responded:] "I tell you, friend, that it is not
possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does
not take birth, age, die, pass away, or reappear. But at the same time, I tell you that
there is no making an end of suffering &amp; stress without reaching the end of the
cosmos. Yet it is just within this fathom-long body, with its perception &amp; intellect,
that I declare that there is the cosmos, the origination of the cosmos, the
cessation of the cosmos, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of the
cosmos."
<!--l. 6052--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s not to be reached by traveling, the end of the cosmos &#8212; regardless.
And it&#8217;s not without reaching the end of the cosmos that there is release
from suffering &amp; stress. So, truly, the wise one, an expert with regard to
the cosmos, a knower of the end of the cosmos, having fulfilled the holy
life, calmed, knowing the cosmos&#8217; end, does not long for this cosmos or any

other.

<!--l. 6061--><p class="indent" >   §11. I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at
Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. There he addressed the group of five
monks:
<!--l. 6065--><p class="indent" >   "There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone
forth. Which two? That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to
sensual objects: base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unprofitable; and that which is
devoted to self-affliction: painful, ignoble, unprofitable. Avoiding both of these
extremes, the middle way realized by the Tathagata &#8212; producing vision,
producing knowledge &#8212; leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to
Unbinding.
<!--l. 6074--><p class="indent" >   "And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that &#8212; producing vision,
producing knowledge &#8212; leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to
Unbinding? Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right resolve, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
concentration. This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that &#8212; producing
vision, producing knowledge &#8212; leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening,
to Unbinding.
<!--l. 6083--><p class="indent" >   "Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging is stressful,
death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stressful;
association with the unbeloved is stressful, separation from the loved is stressful, not
getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are
stressful.

non-becoming.

&#8217;Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further
becoming.&#8217;"
<!--l. 6146--><p class="indent" >   That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the group of five monks delighted at
his words. And while this explanation was being given, there arose to Ven. Kondañña
the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: Whatever is subject to origination is all subject

<!--l. 7544--><p class="indent" >   [Ven. Ratthapala:]
<!--l. 7546--><p class="indent" >   I see in the world people with wealth who, from delusion, don&#8217;t make a gift of the
treasure they&#8217;ve gained. Greedy, they stash it away, hoping for even more sensual
pleasures. A king who, by force, has conquered the world and rules over the earth to
the edge of the sea, dissatisfied with the ocean&#8217;s near shore, longs for the
ocean&#8217;s far shore as well. Kings &amp; others &#8212; plenty of people &#8212; go to death
with craving unabated. Unsated they leave the body behind, having not
had enough of the world&#8217;s sensual pleasures. One&#8217;s relatives weep &amp; pull
out their hair. &#8217;Oh woe, our loved one is dead,&#8217; they cry. Carrying him off,
wrapped in a piece of cloth, they place him on a pyre, then set him on fire.
So he burns, poked with sticks, in just one piece of cloth, leaving all his
possessions behind. They are not shelters for one who has died &#8212; not relatives,
friends, or companions. His heirs take over his wealth, while the being goes
on, in line with his kamma. No wealth at all follows the dead one &#8212; not
children, wives, dominion, or riches. Long life can&#8217;t be gotten with wealth, nor
aging warded off with treasure. The wise say this life is next to nothing &#8212;
impermanent, subject to change. The rich &amp; the poor touch the touch of Death.
The foolish &amp; wise are touched by it, too. But while fools lie as if slain by
their folly, the wise don&#8217;t tremble when touched by the touch. Thus the
discernment by which one attains to mastery, is better than wealth &#8212; for
those who haven&#8217;t reached mastery go from existence to existence, out of
delusion, doing bad deeds. One goes to a womb &amp; to the next world, falling
into the wandering on &#8212; one thing after another &#8212; while those of weak
discernment, trusting in one, also go to a womb &amp; to the next world. Just
as an evil thief caught at the break-in is destroyed by his own act, so evil
people &#8212; after dying, in the next world &#8212; are destroyed by their own acts.
Sensual pleasures &#8212; variegated, enticing, sweet &#8212; in various ways disturb the
mind. Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects: that&#8217;s why, O king, I went
forth. Just like fruits, people fall &#8212; young &amp; old &#8212; at the break-up of the
body. Knowing this, O king, I went forth. The contemplative life is better for
sure.

beings: noble warriors, priests, priests, workers, outcastes, &amp; scavengers. They
spare nothing. They trample everything. Here elephant troops can hold no
ground, nor can chariots or infantry, nor can a battle of wits or wealth win
out. So a wise person, seeing his own good, steadfast, secures confidence
in the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha. One who practices the Dhamma in
thought, word, &amp; deed, receives praise here on earth and after death rejoices in
heaven.

old when this discourse was delivered to him.2.Samañña. Throughout ancient
cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people
and acts. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors
for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments were metaphors for good.
In Pali, the termsama &#8212; "even" &#8212; described an instrument tuned on-pitch. There is
a famous passage where the Buddha reminds Sona Kolivisa &#8212; who had been
over-exerting himself in the practice &#8212; that a lute sounds appealing only if the
strings are neither too taut or too lax, but "evenly" tuned. This image would have
special resonance with the Buddha&#8217;s teaching on the middle way. It also
adds meaning to the termsamana &#8212; monk or contemplative &#8212; which the
texts frequently mention as being derived fromsama. The wordsamañña &#8212;
"evenness," the quality of being in tune &#8212; also means the quality of being a
contemplative: the true contemplative is always in tune with what is proper and
good.

fruit as pleasure. What isn&#8217;t given does not: thieves take it away, or kings; it gets
burnt by fire or lost. Then in the end one leaves the body together with one&#8217;s
possessions. Knowing this, the intelligent man enjoys possessions &amp; gives. Having

lament, beat my breast, &amp; become distraught, food would not agree with me, my
body would become unattractive, my affairs would go untended, my enemies
would be gratified and my friends unhappy.&#8217; So, with the destruction of
what is subject to destruction, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament, does
not beat his breast or become distraught. This is called a well-instructed
disciple of the noble ones who has pulled out the poisoned arrow of sorrow
pierced with which the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person torments himself.
Sorrowless, arrowless, the disciple of the noble ones is totally unbound right within
himself.

Knowing you to be sorrowing &amp; in pain, your enemies are gratified. But when a sage
with a sense for determining what is his aim doesn&#8217;t waver in the face of misfortune,
his enemies are pained, seeing his face unchanged, as of old. Where &amp; however an aim
is accomplished through eulogies, chants, good sayings, donations, &amp; family customs,
follow them diligently there &amp; that way. But if you discern that your own
aim or that of others is not gained in this way, acquiesce [to the nature of
things] unsorrowing, with the thought: &#8217;What important work am I doing

severe illness within him. Sharp &amp; deadly were the pains, but he bore them
mindfully, alert, &amp; unperturbed. The thought occurred to him, "It would not be
proper for me to enter total Unbinding without addressing my attendants &amp; without
taking leave of the community of monks. Why don&#8217;t I, suppressing this illness with

the Blessed One in comfort! What a happy sight to see the Blessed One at ease!
Because of the Blessed One&#8217;s sickness my own body felt as if it were drugged. I lost
my bearings. Things were unclear to me. Yet I still took a measure of comfort in the
thought that the Blessed One would not enter total Unbinding as long as he

pronouncement concerning the community of monks. But the Tathagata has no such

Tathagata&#8217;s body feels at ease is when, not attending to any theme at all, and
with the cessation of certain feelings, he enters &amp; remains in the theme-less
concentration of awareness. Therefore each of you should remain with your self
as an island, your self as your refuge, without anything else as a refuge.
Remain with the Dhamma as an island, the Dhamma as your refuge, without

guide to becoming, when phenomena are seen for what they are, then just as in the
laying down of a burden, there is no fear in death. I have lived well the holy life,
well-developed the path. Death holds no fear for me. It&#8217;s like the end of

seen states of becoming as devoid of allure, like poison spit out after it&#8217;s

completed, welcomes the ending of life, as if freed from a place of execution.
Having attained the supreme Rightness, unconcerned with all the world, as
if released from a burning house, he does not sorrow at death. Whatever
is compounded, wherever a state of becoming is obtained, all that has no
one in charge: so says the Great Seer. Whoever discerns this, as taught by
the Awakened One, would no more grasp hold of any state of becoming
than he would a hot iron ball. I have no "I was," no "I will be." Processes
will simply go out of existence. What&#8217;s to lament there in that? For one
who sees, as it actually is, the pure arising of phenomena, the pure seriality
of processes, there&#8217;s no fear. When seeing the world with discernment as
on a par with grass &amp; twigs, finding no "mine-ness," thinking, "There is
nothing of mine," he feels no sorrow. I am dissatisfied with this carcass,
unconcerned with becoming. This body will break up and there will not be another.
Do as you like with this carcass. From that I will feel neither hatred nor

good will &#8212; helpful, happy, whole-hearted, without limit; with verbal acts of good
will... with mental acts of good will &#8212; helpful, happy, whole-hearted, without limit.
You are one who has made merit. Commit yourself to exertion, and soon you will be
without mental fermentations."
<!--l. 11075--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Monks, those who, in the past,
were worthy ones, rightly self-awakened, had foremost attendants, just as I
have had Ananda. Those who, in the future, will be worthy ones, rightly
self-awakened, will have foremost attendants, just as I have had Ananda.
Ananda is wise, he knows, &#8217;This is the time to approach to see the Tathagata.
This is the time for monks, this the time for nuns, this the time for male
lay-followers, this the time for female lay-followers, this the time for kings &amp;
their ministers, this the time for sectarians, this the time for the followers of
sectarians.
<!--l. 11086--><p class="indent" >   "There are these four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in Ananda. If a group of
monks approaches to see Ananda, they are gratified at the sight of him. If he speaks
Dhamma to them, they are gratified with what he says. Before they are sated, he

followers approaches to see Ananda... If a group of female lay followers approaches to

These are the four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in Ananda. There are
these four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in a wheel-turning monarch. If a

<!--l. 11110--><p class="indent" >   Now at that time Subhadda the Wanderer was staying in Kusinara. He heard,
"Tonight, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of Gotama the
contemplative will take place." Then the thought occurred to him: "I have heard the
elder wanderers, teachers of teachers, saying that only once in a long, long time do
Tathagatas &#8212; worthy ones, rightly self-awakened &#8212; appear in the world. Tonight, in
the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will
occur. Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me, but I have faith that
he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that
doubt."
<!--l. 11122--><p class="indent" >   So he went to Upavattana, the Mallans&#8217; sal-grove and, on arrival, said to Ven.
Ananda, "I have heard the elder wanderers, teachers of teachers, saying that only
once in a long, long time do Tathagatas &#8212; worthy ones, rightly self-awakened &#8212;
appear in the world. Tonight, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of
Gotama the contemplative will occur. Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me,
but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might
abandon that doubt. It would be good, Ven. Ananda, if you would let me see
him."
<!--l. 11132--><p class="indent" >   When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to him, "Enough, friend Subhadda. Don&#8217;t
bother the Blessed One. The Blessed One is tired."
<!--l. 11136--><p class="indent" >   For a second time... For a third time, Subhadda the Wanderer said to
Ven. Ananda, "...It would be good, Ven. Ananda, if you would let me see
him."
<!--l. 11140--><p class="indent" >   For a third time, Ven. Ananda said to him, "Enough, friend Subhadda. Don&#8217;t
bother the Blessed One. The Blessed One is tired."
<!--l. 11144--><p class="indent" >   Now, the Blessed One heard the exchange between Ven. Ananda &amp; Subhadda the
Wanderer, and so he said to Ven. Ananda, "Enough, Ananda. Don&#8217;t stand in his way.
Let him see the Tathagata. Whatever he asks me will all be for the sake of
knowledge, and not to be bothersome. And whatever I answer when asked, he will
quickly understand."
<!--l. 11150--><p class="indent" >   So Ven. Ananda said to Subhadda the Wanderer, "Go ahead, friend Subhadda.
The Blessed One gives you his leave."

<!--l. 11153--><p class="indent" >   Then Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with
him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As
he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, these priests &amp;
contemplatives, each with his group, each with his community, each the
teacher of his group, an honored leader, well-regarded by people at large
&#8212; i.e., Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha
Kaccayana, Sañjaya Belatthaputta, &amp; the Nigantha Nataputta: Do they all have
direct knowledge as they themselves claim, or do they all not have direct
knowledge, or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them
not?"
<!--l. 11165--><p class="indent" >   "Enough, Subhadda. Put this question aside. I will teach you the Dhamma.
Listen, and pay close attention. I will speak."
<!--l. 11168--><p class="indent" >   "Yes, lord," Subhadda answered, and the Blessed One said, "In any doctrine &amp;
discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found, no contemplative of the first...
second... third... fourth order [stream-winner, once-returner, non-returner, or arahant]
is found. But in any doctrine &amp; discipline where the noble eightfold pathis found,
contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth orderare found. The noble
eightfold path is found in this doctrine &amp; discipline, and right here there are
contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are empty
of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world will not
be empty of arahants.
<!--l. 11180--><p class="indent" >   At age twenty-nine I went forth, seeking what might be skillful, and since my
going forth more than fifty years have past. Outside of the realm of methodical
Dhamma, there is no contemplative.
<!--l. 11184--><p class="indent" >   And no contemplative of the second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are
empty of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world
will not be empty of arahants."
<!--l. 11188--><p class="indent" >   Then Subhadda the Wanderer said, "Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he
were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point
out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that
those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One &#8212;
through many lines of reasoning &#8212; made the Dhamma clear. I go to the
Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the community of monks.
Let me obtain the going forth in the Blessed One&#8217;s presence, let me obtain
admission."
<!--l. 11198--><p class="indent" >   "Anyone, Subhadda, who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires
the going forth &amp; admission in this doctrine &amp; discipline, must first undergo
probation for four months. If, at the end of four months, the monks feel so moved,
they give him the going forth &amp; admit him to the monk&#8217;s state. But I know
distinctions among individuals in this matter."
<!--l. 11205--><p class="indent" >   "Lord, if that is so, I am willing to undergo probation for four years. If, at the end
of four years, the monks feel so moved, let them give me the going forth &amp; admit me
to the monk&#8217;s state."
<!--l. 11209--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda, "Very well then, Ananda, give
Subhadda the going forth."
<!--l. 11212--><p class="indent" >   "Yes, lord," Ananda answered.

<!--l. 11214--><p class="indent" >   Then Subhadda said to Ven. Ananda, "It is a gain for you, Ananda, a great gain,
that you have been anointed here in the Teacher&#8217;s presence with the pupil&#8217;s
anointing."
<!--l. 11218--><p class="indent" >   Then Subhadda the Wanderer received the going forth &amp; the admission in
the Blessed One&#8217;s presence. And not long after his admission &#8212; dwelling
alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute &#8212; he in no long time reached &amp;
remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go
forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the
here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.
There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And thus Ven. Subhadda
became another one of the arahants, the last of the Blessed One&#8217;s face-to-face
disciples.
<!--l. 11229--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda, "Now, if it occurs to any of you &#8212;
&#8217;The teaching has lost its authority; we are without a Teacher&#8217; &#8212; do not view it in
that way. Whatever Dhamma &amp; Vinaya I have pointed out &amp; formulated for you,
that will be your Teacher when I am gone"...
<!--l. 11235--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "If even a single monk has any doubt
or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path or the practice,
ask. Don&#8217;t later regret that &#8217;The Teacher was face-to-face with us, but we didn&#8217;t
bring ourselves to ask a counter-question in his presence.&#8217;"
<!--l. 11241--><p class="indent" >   When this was said, the monks were silent.
<!--l. 11243--><p class="indent" >   A second time... a third time, the Blessed One said, "If even one of the
monks has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or
Sangha, the path or the practice, ask. Don&#8217;t later regret that &#8217;The Teacher was
face-to-face with us, but we didn&#8217;t bring ourselves to ask a counter-question in his
presence.&#8217;"
<!--l. 11249--><p class="indent" >   A third time, the monks were silent.
<!--l. 11251--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Now, if it&#8217;s out of respect for the
Teacher that you don&#8217;t ask, let a friend inform a friend."
<!--l. 11255--><p class="indent" >   When this was said, the monks were silent.
<!--l. 11257--><p class="indent" >   Then Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "It&#8217;s amazing, lord. It&#8217;s marvelous.
I&#8217;m confident that, in this community of monks, there is not even a single monk who
has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path
or the practice."
<!--l. 11262--><p class="indent" >   "You, Ananda, speak out of confidence, while there is knowledge in the Tathagata
that, in this community of monks, there is not even a single monk who has any doubt
or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path or the practice.
Of these 500 monks, the most backward is a stream-winner, not destined for the
planes of deprivation, headed to self-awakening for sure."
<!--l. 11269--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Now, then, monks, I exhort you: All
fabrications are subject to decay. Bring about completion by means of heedfulness."
Those were the Tathagata&#8217;s last words.
<!--l. 11274--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One entered the first jhana. Emerging from that he entered the
second jhana. Emerging from that, he entered the third... the fourth jhana... the
dimension of the infinitude of space... the dimension of the infinitude of
consciousness... the dimension of nothingness... the dimension of neither perception

nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he entered the cessation of perception &amp;
feeling.
<!--l. 11281--><p class="indent" >   Then Ven. Ananda said to Ven. Anuruddha, "Ven. Anuruddha, the Blessed One is
totally unbound."
<!--l. 11284--><p class="indent" >   "No, friend Ananda. The Blessed One isn&#8217;t totally unbound. He has entered the
cessation of perception &amp; feeling."
<!--l. 11287--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One, emerging from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling,
entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that,
he entered the dimension of nothingness... the dimension of the infinitude of

third... the second... the first jhana. Emerging from the first jhana he entered the
second... the third... the fourth jhana. Emerging from the fourth jhana, he
immediately was totally Unbound.
<!--l. 11296--><p class="indent" >   When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total
Unbinding, there was a great earthquake, awesome &amp; hair-raising, and the drums of
the devas sounded.
<!--l. 11300--><p class="indent" >   When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total
Unbinding, Sahampati Brahma uttered this verse:
<!--l. 11303--><p class="indent" >   All beings &#8212; all &#8212; in the world, will cast off the bodily heap in the
world where a Teacher like this without peer in the world the Tathagata,
with strength attained, the Rightly Self-Awakened One, has been totally
Unbound.
<!--l. 11308--><p class="indent" >   When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total
Unbinding, Sakka, ruler of the gods, uttered this verse:
<!--l. 11311--><p class="indent" >   How inconstant are compounded things! Their nature: to arise &amp; pass away. They
disband as they are arising. Their total stilling is bliss.
<!--l. 11314--><p class="indent" >   When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total
Unbinding, Ven. Anuruddha uttered this verse:
<!--l. 11317--><p class="indent" >   He had no in-&amp;-out breathing, the one who was Such, the firm-minded one,
imperturbable &amp; bent on peace: the sage completing his span. With heart
unbowed he endured the pain. Like a flame&#8217;s unbinding was the liberation of
awareness.
<!--l. 11322--><p class="indent" >   When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total
Unbinding, Ven. Ananda uttered this verse:
<!--l. 11325--><p class="indent" >   It was awe-inspiring. It was hair-raising when, displaying the foremost
accomplishment in all things, the Rightly Self-Awakened One was totally
Unbound.
<!--l. 11329--><p class="indent" >   When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total
Unbinding, some of the monks present who were not without passion wept, uplifting
their arms. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fell down and rolled
back &amp; forth, crying, "All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound! All too soon
is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes has
disappeared from the world!" But those monks who were free from passion
acquiesced, mindful &amp; alert: "Fabrications are inconstant. What else is there to
expect?"
<!--l. 11339--><p class="indent" >   Then Ven. Anuruddha addressed the monks, "Enough, friends. Don&#8217;t grieve.

Don&#8217;t lament. Hasn&#8217;t the Blessed One already taught the state of growing
different with regard to all things dear &amp; appealing, the state of becoming
separate, the state of becoming otherwise? What else is there to expect?
It&#8217;s impossible that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated,
&amp; subject to disintegration from disintegrating. The devatas, friends, are
complaining."
<!--l. 11347--><p class="indent" >   [Ananda:] "But, Ven. Anuruddha, what is the state of the devatas the Blessed
One is referring to?"
<!--l. 11350--><p class="indent" >   "Friend Ananda, there are devatas who perceive space to be earth. Tearing at
their hair, they are weeping. Uplifting their arms, they are weeping. As if their feet

<!--l. 11399--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 11401--><p class="indent" >   Although early Buddhism is widely believed to take a negative attitude toward
the body, the texts of the Pali canon do not support this belief. They approach the
body both in its positive role, as an object of meditation to develop mindfulness,

concentration, and the mental powers based on concentration; and in its negative role
as an object for unskillful states of mind. Even in its negative role, the body is not
the culprit: the problem is the mind&#8217;s attachment to the body. Once the body can be
used in its positive role, to develop mindfulness and concentration, those mental
qualities can be used to free the mind of its attachments to the body. Then, as
many a modern meditation master has noted, the mind and body can live in
peace.
<!--l. 11413--><p class="indent" >   This study guide focuses on the primary sutta in the Pali canon dealing with the
contemplation of the body: The Discourse on Mindfulness Immersed in the Body
(MN 119). The first section, The Context, establishes the general principles
underlying the practice of mindfulness immersed in the body, showing why
attachment to the body is considered problematic in the first place. The second
section presents the sutta itself. The remaining sections expand on points raised in
the sutta: Section Three dealing with the advantages of practicing mindfulness
immersed in the body, and Section Four expanding on the drawbacks of attachment
to the body.
<!--l. 11424--><p class="indent" >   Because the sutta treats the body both as an object of mindfulness and as an
object of jhana, or mental absorption, it raises questions concerning the relationship
between these two mental qualities in the practice of meditation. There is a
widespread belief that they represent two sides of a great divide in Buddhist
meditation practice, with mindfulness on one side, joined with vipassana (insight)
and discernment; and jhana on the other side joined with samatha (tranquillity). The
Pali canon, however, presents a much more complex picture of the interrelated roles
these mental qualities in the pursuit of Awakening. And in fact, the "Great Divide"
picture of Buddhist meditation practice conflates what the Pali canon treats as
three separate, albeit related issues: the relationship between samatha and
vipassana, the relationship between mindfulness and jhana, and the relationship
between jhana and discernment. To convey the original parameters of these
issues, this study guide ends with three sections focused on precisely these
relationships.

even had lotus ponds made in our palace: one where red-lotuses bloomed, one where
white lotuses bloomed, one where blue lotuses bloomed, all for my sake. I used no

sandalwood that was not from Varanasi. My turban was from Varanasi, as
were my tunic, my lower garments, &amp; my outer cloak. A white sunshade
was held over me day &amp; night to protect me from cold, heat, dust, dirt, &amp;
dew.

rainy season. During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the
rainy-season palace by minstrels without a single man among them, and I did not
once come down from the palace. Whereas the servants, workers, &amp; retainers
in other people&#8217;s homes are fed meals of lentil soup &amp; broken rice, in my
father&#8217;s home the servants, workers, &amp; retainers were fed wheat, rice, and

<!--l. 12202--><p class="indent" >   1.To the fore (parimukham): The Abhidhamma takes an etymological approach to
this term, defining it as around (pari-) the mouth (mukham). In the Vinaya, however,
it is used in a context (Cv.V.27.4) where it undoubtedly means the front of the chest.
There is also the possibility that the term could be used idiomatically as "to the
front," which is how I have translated it here.2.The commentaries insist
that "body" here means the breath, but this is unlikely in this context,
for the next step &#8212; without further explanation &#8212; refers to the breath
as "bodily fabrication." If the Buddha were using two different terms to
refer to the breath in such close proximity, he would have been careful to
signal that he was redefining his terms (as he does below, when explaining
that the first four steps in breath meditation correspond to the practice of
focusing on the body in and of itself as a frame of reference). The step of
breathing in and out sensitive to the entire body relates to the many similes

in the suttas depicting jhana as a state of whole-body awareness (see MN
119).3."In-&amp;-out breaths are bodily; these are things tied up with the body. That&#8217;s
why in-&amp;-out breaths are bodily fabrications." &#8212; MN 44.4."Perceptions &amp;
feelings are mental; these are things tied up with the mind. That&#8217;s why
perceptions &amp; feelings are mental fabrications." &#8212; MN 44.5.AN 9.34 shows how
the mind, step by step, is temporarily released from burdensome mental
states of greater and greater refinement as it advances through the stages of
jhana.6.As this shows, a meditator focusing on feelings in themselves as a
frame of reference should not abandon the breath as the basis for his/her
concentration.

<!--l. 12941--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;What wrong have I done you that you stand in my way? It&#8217;s not proper, my
friend, that a man should touch a woman gone forth. I respect the Master&#8217;s message,
the training pointed out by the one well-gone. I am pure, without blemish: Why do
you stand in my way? You &#8212; your mind agitated, impassioned; I &#8212; unagitated,
unimpassioned, with a mind entirely freed: Why do you stand in my way?&#8217; &#8217;You are
young &amp; not bad-looking, what need do you have for going forth? Throw off your
ochre robe &#8212; Come, let&#8217;s delight in the flowering grove. A sweetness they exude
everywhere, the towering trees with their pollen. The beginning of spring is a
pleasant season &#8212; Come, let&#8217;s delight in the flowering grove. The trees with their
blossoming tips moan, as it were, in the breeze: What delight will you have if you
plunge into the grove alone? Frequented by herds of wild beasts, disturbed by
elephants rutting &amp; aroused: you want to go unaccompanied into the great,
lonely, frightening grove? Like a doll made of gold, you will go about, like a
goddess in the gardens of heaven. With delicate, smooth Kasi fabrics, you will
shine, O beauty without compare. I would gladly do your every bidding if

we were to dwell in the glade. For there is no creature dearer to me than
you, O nymph with the languid regard. If you do as I ask, happy, come live
in my house. Dwelling in the calm of a palace, have women wait on you,
wear delicate Kasi fabrics, adorn yourself with garlands &amp; creams. I will
make you many &amp; varied ornaments of gold, jewels, &amp; pearls. Climb onto a
costly bed, scented with sandalwood carvings, with a well-washed coverlet,
beautiful, spread with a woolen quilt, brand new. Like a blue lotus rising
from the water where no human beings dwell, you will go to old age with
your limbs unseen, if you stay as you are in the holy life.&#8217; &#8217;What do you
assume of any essence, here in this cemetery grower, filled with corpses, this
body destined to break up? What do you see when you look at me, you who
are out of your mind?&#8217; &#8217;Your eyes are like those of a fawn, like those of a
sprite in the mountains. Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the
more. Like tips they are, of blue lotuses, in your golden face &#8212; spotless:
Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the more. Even if you should
go far away, I will think only of your pure, long-lashed gaze, for there is
nothing dearer to me than your eyes, O nymph with the languid regard.&#8217;
&#8217;You want to stray from the road, you want the moon as a plaything, you
want to jump over Mount Sineru, you who have designs on one born of the
Buddha. For there is nothing anywhere at all in the cosmos with its gods, that
would be an object of passion for me. I don&#8217;t even know what that passion
would be, for it&#8217;s been killed, root &amp; all, by the path. Like embers from
a pit &#8212; scattered, like a bowl of poison &#8212; evaporated, I don&#8217;t even see
what that passion would be, for it&#8217;s been killed, root &amp; all, by the path.
Try to seduce one who hasn&#8217;t reflected on this, or who has not followed the
Master&#8217;s teaching. But try it with this one who knows and you suffer. For in
the midst of praise &amp; blame, pleasure &amp; pain, my mindfulness stands firm.
Knowing the unattractiveness of things compounded, my mind cleaves to
nothing at all. I am a follower of the one well-gone, riding the vehicle of the
eightfold way: My arrow removed, effluent-free, I delight, having gone to an
empty dwelling. For I have seen well-painted puppets, hitched up with sticks
&amp; strings, made to dance in various ways. When the sticks &amp; strings are
removed, thrown away, scattered, shredded, smashed into pieces, not to
be found, in what will the mind there make its home? This body of mine,
which is just like that, when devoid of dhammas doesn&#8217;t function. When,
devoid of dhammas, it doesn&#8217;t function, in what will the mind there make its
home? Like a mural you&#8217;ve seen, painted on a wall, smeared with yellow
orpiment, there your vision has been distorted, meaningless your human
perception. Like an evaporated mirage, like a tree of gold in a dream, like a
magic show in the midst of a crowd &#8212; you run blind after what is unreal.
Resembling a ball of sealing wax, set in a hollow, with a bubble in the middle and
bathed with tears, eye secretions are born there too: The parts of the eye are
rolled all together in various ways.&#8217; Plucking out her lovely eye, with mind
unattached she felt no regret. &#8217;Here, take this eye. It&#8217;s yours.&#8217; Straightaway she
gave it to him. Straightaway his passion faded right there, and he begged
her forgiveness. &#8217;Be well, follower of the holy life. This sort of thing won&#8217;t

happen again. Harming a person like you is like embracing a blazing fire, It
is as if I have seized a poisonous snake. So may you be well. Forgive me.&#8217;
And released from there, the nun went to the excellent Buddha&#8217;s presence.
When she saw the mark of his excellent merit, her eye became as it was
before.

<!--l. 15782--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 15784--><p class="indent" >   The four noble truths are the most basic expression of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching. As
Ven. Sariputta once said, they encompass the entire teaching, just as the footprint
of an elephant can encompass the footprints of all other footed beings on
earth.
<!--l. 15789--><p class="indent" >   These four truths are best understood, not as beliefs, but as categories of
experience. They offer an alternative to the ordinary way we categorize what we can
know and describe, in terms of me/not me, and being/not being. These ordinary
categories create trouble, for the attempt to maintain full being for one&#8217;s sense of
"me" is a stressful effort doomed to failure, in that all of the components of that
"me" are inconstant, stressful, and thus not worthy of identifying as "me" or
"mine."
<!--l. 15799--><p class="indent" >   To counter this problem, the four noble truths drop ideas of me/not me, and
being/not being, and replace them with two sets of variables: cause and
effect, skillful and unskillful. In other words, there is the truth of stress and
suffering (unskillful effect), the truth of the origination of stress (unskillful
cause), the truth of the cessation of stress (skillful effect), and the truth of the
path to the cessation of stress (skillful cause). Each of these truths entails a
duty: stress is to be comprehended, the origination of stress abandoned, the
cessation of stress realized, and the path to the cessation of stress developed.
When all of these duties have been fully performed, the mind gains total
release.
<!--l. 15811--><p class="indent" >   Many people have charged Buddhism with being pessimistic because
the four truths start out with stress and suffering, but this charge misses
the fact that the first truth is part of a strategy of diagnosis and therapy
focusing on the basic problem in life so as to offer a solution to it. Thus
the Buddha was like a doctor, focusing on the disease he wanted to cure.
Charging him with pessimism is like charging a doctor with pessimism when
he asks, "Where does it hurt?" The total cure the Buddha promised as a
result of his course of therapy shows that, in actuality, he was much less
pessimistic than the vast majority of the world, for whom wisdom means
accepting the bad things in life with the good, assuming that there is no

chance in this life for unalloyed happiness. The Buddha was an extremely
demanding person, unwilling to bend to this supposed wisdom or to rest with
anything less than absolute happiness. His course of therapy points to the fact
that such a happiness is possible, and can be attained through our own
efforts.
<!--l. 15828--><p class="indent" >   Another charge often leveled at Buddhism is that its focus is narrow, aiming only
at the issue of stress and pain, and ignoring the larger or more uplifting issues of
spiritual life. This, again, misses the thrust of the Buddha&#8217;s cure for the ills of the
heart and mind. One of the most important insights leading up to the Buddha&#8217;s
Awakening was his realization that the act of comprehending pain lay at the
essence of the spiritual quest. In trying to comprehend pain, one begins
to delve into the non-verbal, subconscious levels of the mind, bringing to
light many ill-formed and hidden processes of which one was previously
unaware. In this sense, pain is like a watering hole where all the animals in the
forest &#8212; all the mind&#8217;s subconscious tendencies &#8212; will eventually come to
drink. Just as a naturalist who wants to make a survey of the wildlife in
a particular area can simply station himself near a watering hole, in the
same way, a meditator who wants to understand the mind can simply keep
watch right at pain in order to see what subconscious reactions will appear.
Thus the act of trying to comprehend pain leads not only to an improved
understanding of pain itself, but also to an increased awareness of the most
basic processes at work in the mind. As one fully comprehends pain, one
gains a full comprehension of other spiritual issues as well, realizing which
questions were worth asking and which ones weren&#8217;t, at the same time gaining
answers to the first set of questions and learning how to put the second set
aside.
<!--l. 15852--><p class="indent" >   Thus the study of the four noble truths is aimed first at understanding these four
categories, and then at applying them to experience so that one may act properly
toward each of the categories and thus attain the highest, most total happiness
possible.
<!--l. 15857--><p class="indent" >   The material in this study guide starts with a basic exercise in categorizing one&#8217;s
actions in terms of the variables at the heart of the four noble truths: cause and
effect, and skillful and unskillful. It then builds on this understanding by
discussing the role of the four noble truths in the course of the practice, and then
analyzing in detail each of the truths, together with the duty appropriate
to each. Further related readings can be found in the book, The Wings to
Awakening.

<!--l. 15870--><p class="indent" >   Rahula: "For reflection, sir."
<!--l. 15872--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha: "In the same way, Rahula, bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts
are to be done with repeated reflection.
<!--l. 15875--><p class="indent" >   "Whenever you want to perform a bodily act, you should reflect on it:
&#8217;This bodily act I want to perform &#8212; would it lead to self-affliction, to the
affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful
consequences, painful results?&#8217; If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to

self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily
act with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily act of that
sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it
would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily act with happy

do.

confess it, reveal it, lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in
the holy life. Having confessed it... you should exercise restraint in the future.
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a
skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then you should
stay mentally refreshed &amp; joyful, training day &amp; night in skillful mental
qualities.

<!--l. 15922--><p class="indent" >   "Rahula, all the priests &amp; contemplatives in the course of the past who purified
their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, did it through repeated reflection on
their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.

<!--l. 15943--><p class="indent" >   § 2.
<!--l. 15945--><p class="indent" >   Once the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa tree grove. Then,
picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand, he asked the monks, "What do you
think, monks: Which are more numerous, the few Simsapa leaves in my hand or those
overhead in the Simsapa grove?"
<!--l. 15951--><p class="indent" >   "The leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number, lord. Those
overhead in the grove are far more numerous."
<!--l. 15954--><p class="indent" >   "In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge
but have not taught are far more numerous than the things I have taught. And why
haven&#8217;t I taught them? Because they are not connected with the goal, do not relate
to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to
cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That is why
I have not taught them.
<!--l. 15962--><p class="indent" >   "And what have I taught? &#8217;This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This

<!--l. 17696--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 17698--><p class="indent" >   Of all the concepts central to Buddhism, merit (puñña) is one of the least known
and least appreciated in the West. This is perhaps because the pursuit of merit seems
to be a lowly practice, focused on getting and "selfing," whereas higher Buddhist
practice focuses on letting go, particularly of any sense of self. Because we in the
West often feel pressed for time, we don&#8217;t want to waste our time on lowly practices,
and instead want to go straight to the higher levels. Yet the Buddha repeatedly
warns that the higher levels cannot be practiced in a stable manner unless
they develop on a strong foundation. The pursuit of merit provides that
foundation. To paraphrase a modern Buddhist psychologist, one cannot
wisely let go of one&#8217;s sense of self until one has developed a wise sense of
self. The pursuit of merit is the Buddhist way to develop a wise sense of
self.
<!--l. 17713--><p class="indent" >   The following readings show how this is done. They begin with a section on basic
wisdom, which shows how the questions that lead ultimately to the wisdom of letting
go first focus on things to hold onto: the skillful traits that, on the beginning level,
provide a secure place to stand while letting go of character traits that are obviously
harmful. Buddhist wisdom famously focuses in the characteristics of inconstancy,
stress, and not-self, but the application of that wisdom grows out of the
pursuit of what is relatively constant and pleasant, and requires a mature
sense of self: able to plan for the future, to sacrifice short-term happiness for
long-term happiness, to consider the needs of others, and to develop a strong

sense of self-reliance in the pursuit of a happiness that is wise, pure, and
compassionate.
<!--l. 17726--><p class="indent" >   The section on merit then sets out in general terms the types of meritorious
activities that conduce to that happiness, focusing primarily on three: giving, virtue,
and meditation. The next three sections focus on the ways in which each of these
activities can be pursued so as to produce the most happiness. For instance, the
section on giving discusses how the happiness of generosity can be maximized by
wisely choosing the proper motivation for giving a gift, a proper gift, and a proper
recipient for one&#8217;s gift. The section of virtue shows how to learn from one&#8217;s past
mistakes without succumbing to debilitating feelings of guilt. The section on
meditation discusses not only how the development of good will &#8212; the meditative
practice most often cited in conjunction with merit &#8212; can lead to happiness both
now and in the present, but also how it can help minimize the bad results of one&#8217;s
past unwise actions.
<!--l. 17741--><p class="indent" >   All three of these forms of merit conduce to the highest form of merit: the
realization of stream-entry, the first glimpse of the deathless. Thus the penultimate
section of this study guide focuses on the happiness and well-being that derive from
this attainment.
<!--l. 17746--><p class="indent" >   For all the rewards of meritorious action, however, the concluding section serves
as a reminder that the pursuit of happiness ultimately leads beyond the pursuit of
merit. In fact, this study guide is planned as part of a two-part study guide covering
the Buddhist approach to the pursuit of happiness, with the second part discussing
the teachings on the three characteristics as the next stage in this approach as they
lead to the deathless happiness attained with arahantship. Still, it would
be a mistake to view the two stages as radically separate. In the course of
developing a wise sense of self in the pursuit of merit, one is already learning how
to let go of unwise ways of "selfing" as one learns to overcome stinginess,
apathy, and hard-heartedness through the development of giving, virtue, and
good will. The teachings on the three characteristics simply carry this same
process of "de-selfing" for the sake of an even truer happiness to a higher
pitch.

says, &#8217;I have seen.&#8217; Thus he doesn&#8217;t consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake

abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to
break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he
does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus
reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united,

He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that

Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season,

that the development of good will as an immeasurable state can lead only to the
first jhana, and that the next two immeasurable states &#8212; compassion and
appreciation &#8212; can lead, respectively, only to the second and third jhanas.
However, as AN 8.63 shows below, all four immeasurable states can lead
all the way to the fourth jhana. The difference between that discourse and
this lies in how the person practicing these states relates to them. In that
sutta, the person deliberately uses the state as a basis for developing all the
jhanas. In this sutta, the person simply enjoys the state and remains in
it.

<!--l. 21103--><p class="indent" >   "This is the purpose for conversation, this is the purpose for consultation, this is
the purpose of apprenticeship, this is the purpose for lending ear: the liberation of
the mind through non-clinging."
<!--l. 21107--><p class="indent" >   This quotation from chapter 12 of the Parivara, the appendix to the
Vinaya, is obviously not talking about ordinary conversation. It&#8217;s talking about
the ideal type of conversation among meditators, the very opposite of idle
chatter:
<!--l. 21112--><p class="indent" >   Abandoning idle chatter, one abstains from idle chatter. One speaks in season,
speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, &amp; the
Vinaya. One speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed,
connected with the goal.
<!--l. 21117--><p class="indent" >   Several passages in the Canon list ten ideal topics for such conversation:
modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue,
concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge &amp; vision of release. The
purpose of this study guide is to illustrate each of these topics with passages from the
Canon, and to provide meditators with the incentive to integrate conversation of
this sort into their practice. There is some overlap between the topics listed
here and those listed in two other study guides: Recognizing the Dhamma
and The Ten Perfections. Thus some redundancy has been inevitable, but
wherever possible I have also included material unavailable in those two
guides.
<!--l. 21129--><p class="indent" >   The first passage included here, in addition to listing the ten ideal topics, also
lists topics that monks and serious meditators should avoid, ranging from politics and
food to theories about the creation of the world. The Commentary qualifies this list,
saying that if one discusses these topics in a way connected with Dhamma &#8212; for
example, pointing out the ephemeral nature of political power so as to engender a
feeling of dispassion for it &#8212; then that would count as right speech, and an aid to the
liberation of the mind.
<!--l. 21139--><p class="indent" >   § 1. I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at
Jeta&#8217;s Grove, Anathapindika&#8217;s monastery. Now at that time a large number of monks,
after the meal, on returning from their alms round, had gathered at the meeting hall
and were engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation: conversation about

kings, robbers, &amp; ministers of state; armies, alarms, &amp; battles; food &amp; drink; clothing,
furniture, garlands, &amp; scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the
countryside; women &amp; heroes; the gossip of the street &amp; the well; tales of the dead;
tales of diversity, the creation of the world &amp; of the sea; talk of whether things exist
or not.
<!--l. 21151--><p class="indent" >   Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to
the meeting hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready. As he was sitting
there, he addressed the monks: "For what topic of conversation are you gathered
together here? In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been
interrupted?"
<!--l. 21157--><p class="indent" >   "Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we gathered at
the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation:
conversation about kings, robbers, &amp; ministers of state; armies, alarms, &amp; battles;
food &amp; drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, &amp; scents; relatives; vehicles; villages,
towns, cities, the countryside; women &amp; heroes; the gossip of the street &amp; the well;
tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the world &amp; of the sea; talk of
whether things exist or not."
<!--l. 21167--><p class="indent" >   "It isn&#8217;t right, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith
from home to the homeless life, should get engaged in such topics of conversation,
i.e., conversation about kings, robbers, &amp; ministers of state... talk of whether things
exist or not.
<!--l. 21173--><p class="indent" >   "There are these ten topics of [proper] conversation. Which ten? Talk on
modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue,
concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge &amp; vision of release. These are
the ten topics of conversation. If you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of
conversation, you would outshine even the sun &amp; moon, so mighty, so powerful &#8212; to
say nothing of the wanderers of other sects."

self-aggrandizing.&#8217; Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is
the case where a monk, being modest, doesn&#8217;t want it to be known that
&#8217;He is modest.&#8217; Being content, he doesn&#8217;t want it to be known that &#8217;He is

persistence is aroused.&#8217; His mindfulness being established, he doesn&#8217;t want it to be
known that &#8217;His mindfulness is established.&#8217; His mind being centered, he

powers, made thoroughbred by a thoroughbred, good by one who is good, tamed by
Anuruddha, trained by one whose task is done. He, having reached the highest peace

<!--l. 21225--><p class="indent" >   § 4. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi at the Aggalava
Shrine. There he addressed the monks: "Monks, remember Hatthaka of Alavi as
being endowed with seven amazing, astounding qualities. Which seven? Monks,
Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction. He is virtuous. He has a sense of
conscience. He has a sense of concern (for the results of unskillful actions). He is
learned. He is generous. He is discerning. Remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being
endowed with these seven amazing, astounding qualities."
<!--l. 21234--><p class="indent" >   That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, the One Well-going, getting up
from his seat, went into his dwelling.
<!--l. 21237--><p class="indent" >   Then early in the morning a certain monk, having put on his robes and carrying
his bowl &amp; outer robe, went to Hatthaka of Alavi&#8217;s home. On arrival, he
sat down on a seat made ready. Then Hatthaka of Alavi approached the
monk and, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting
there the monk said to him, "Friend, the Blessed One has described you
as being endowed with seven amazing, astounding qualities. Which seven?
&#8217;Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction. He is virtuous. He has a sense of
conscience. He has a sense of concern (for the results of unskillful actions).
He is learned. He is generous. He is discerning.&#8217; Friend, the Blessed One
has described you as being endowed with these seven amazing, astounding
qualities."
<!--l. 21249--><p class="indent" >   "I hope, sir, that there were no white-clad householders there."

<!--l. 21257--><p class="indent" >   Then the monk, having received alms at Hatthaka of Alavi&#8217;s home, departed.
After his meal, returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One. On
arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting
there, [he told the Blessed One what had happened.]
<!--l. 21263--><p class="indent" >   [The Blessed One replied:] "It&#8217;s good, monk, it&#8217;s very good that the clansman is
modest and does not want others to know of the skillful qualities present in him. In

amazing, astounding quality: modesty."

<!--l. 21271--><p class="indent" >   § 5. "&#8217;This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.&#8217;
Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk

is content with any old robe cloth at all, any old almsfood, any old lodging, any old

<!--l. 21277--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; AN 8.30
<!--l. 21279--><p class="indent" >   § 6. "And how is a monk content? Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies
with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of robes to

drawbacks (of attachment to it), and discerning the escape from them. He does not,
on account of his contentment with any old robe cloth at all, exalt himself or
disparage others. In this he is diligent, deft, alert, &amp; mindful. This is said

courteously next to a leper eating his meal. He, with his rotting hand, tossed me a
morsel of food, and as the morsel was dropping, a finger fell off right there. Sitting
next to a wall, I ate that morsel of food, and neither while eating it, nor having
eaten, did I feel any disgust. Whoever has mastered left-over scraps for food, smelly
urine for medicine, the foot of a tree for a dwelling, cast-off rags for robes: He is a
man of the four directions. * * * This is enough for me &#8212; desiring to do jhana,

resolute, mindful; enough for me &#8212; desiring the goal, resolute, a monk; enough for

by a cattle track in a simsapa forest. Then Hatthaka of Alavi, out roaming &amp;
rambling for exercise, saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by
the cattle track in the simsapa forest. On seeing him, he went to him and,
on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting
there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, I hope the Blessed One has slept in
ease."
<!--l. 21351--><p class="indent" >   "Yes, young man. I have slept in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, I

cold blows the Verambha wind. Yet still the Blessed One says, &#8217;Yes, young

windows shut against the wind. Inside he has a horse-hair couch spread with a
long-fleeced coverlet, a white wool coverlet, an embroidered coverlet, a rug of
kadali-deer hide, with a canopy above, &amp; red cushions on either side. And there a
lamp would be burning, and his four wives, with their many charms, would be

exclaim, "What bliss! What bliss!" and on hearing him, the thought occurred to

now, on recollecting that, he is repeatedly exclaiming, &#8217;What bliss! What
bliss!&#8217;" They went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down

Bhaddiya Kaligodha, lord, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an

in sympathy for friends &amp; companions, neglects the true goal. Seeing this danger in

traveler, right-living &amp; wise, overcoming all dangers go with him, gratified, mindful.
If you don&#8217;t gain a mature companion, a fellow traveler, right-living &amp; wise, go alone
like a king renouncing his kingdom, like the elephant in the Matanga wilds, his herd.
We praise companionship &#8212; yes! Those on a par, or better, should be chosen as
friends. If they&#8217;re not to be found, living faultlessly, wander alone, like a
rhinoceros. Seeing radiant bracelets of gold, well-made by a smith, clinking,
clashing, two on an arm, wander alone, like a rhinoceros, [Thinking:] "In the

sensual pleasures, elegant, honeyed, &amp; charming, bewitch the mind with
their manifold forms &#8212; seeing this drawback in sensual strands &#8212; wander
alone, like a rhinoceros. "Calamity, tumor, misfortune, disease, an arrow, a
danger for me." Seeing this danger in sensual strands, wander alone, like a
rhinoceros... Avoid the evil companion disregarding the goal, intent on the
out-of-tune way. Don&#8217;t take as a friend someone heedless &amp; hankering. Wander
alone, like a rhinoceros. Consort with one who is learned, who maintains the
Dhamma, a great &amp; quick-witted friend. Knowing the meanings, subdue
your perplexity, [then] wander alone, like a rhinoceros... Unstartled, like a
lion at sounds. Unsnared, like the wind in a net. Unsmeared, like a lotus
in water: wander alone, like a rhinoceros... At the right time consorting
with the release through good will, compassion, appreciation, equanimity,
unobstructed by all the world, any world, wander alone, like a rhinoceros.
Having let go of passion, aversion, delusion; having shattered the fetters;
undisturbed at the ending of life, wander alone, like a rhinoceros. People
follow &amp; associate for a motive. Friends without a motive these days are
rare. They&#8217;re shrewd for their own ends, &amp; impure. Wander alone, like a

of those blue, white, or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water;
even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of

disappearance of elation &amp; distress &#8212; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity

with a pure, bright awareness, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded
by pure, bright awareness.
<!--l. 23300--><p class="indent" >   Just as if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot with a white cloth so

<!--l. 24276--><p class="indent" >   Meditation Instructions in the Thai Theravada Tradition
<!--l. 24278--><p class="indent" >   Meditation is a centrepiece of Buddhist practice. It is a method to develop the
mind. The emphasis is on concentration, focus, clarity, calmness, and insight. There
are different techniques; most of them are easy to learn and very useful in daily life.
The following is an introduction to samatha-vipassana meditation in the Thai
Theravada tradition (adapted with minor amendments from the Bung Wai Forest
Monastery, Thailand).
<!--l. 24286--><p class="indent" >   Introduction to Insight Meditation
<!--l. 24288--><p class="indent" >   The purpose of Insight Meditation is not to create a system of beliefs, but rather
to give guidance on how to see clearly into the nature of the mind. In this way one
gains first-hand understanding of the way things are, without reliance on opinions or
theories - a direct experience, which has its own vitality. It also gives rise to the sense
of deep calm that comes from knowing something for oneself beyond any
doubt.
<!--l. 24296--><p class="indent" >   The term Insight Meditation (samatha-vipassana) refers to practices for the mind
that develop calm (samatha) through sustained attention and insight (vipassana)
through reflection. A fundamental technique for sustaining attention is focusing
awareness on the body; traditionally, this is practised while sitting or walking. This

guide begins with some advice on this technique.
<!--l. 24303--><p class="indent" >   Reflection occurs quite naturally afterwards, when one is &#8217;comfortable&#8217; within the
context of the meditation exercise. There will be a sense of ease and interest, and one
begins to look around and become acquainted with the mind that is meditating. This
&#8217;looking around&#8217; is called contemplation, a personal and direct seeing that can only
be suggested by any technique.
<!--l. 24310--><p class="indent" >   Sustaining Attention
<!--l. 24312--><p class="indent" >   Focusing the mind on the body can be readily accomplished while sitting. You
need to find a time and a place which affords you calm and freedom from
disturbance. A quite room with not much in it to distract the mind is ideal. Timing
is also important. It is not especially productive to meditate when you have
something else to do or when you&#8217;re pressed for time. It&#8217;s better to set aside a period
- say in the early morning or in the evening after work-when you can really give your
full attention to the practice.
<!--l. 24321--><p class="indent" >   Begin with fifteen minutes or so. Practice sincerely with the limitations of time
and available energy, and avoid becoming mechanical about the routine.
Meditation practice, supported by genuine willingness to investigate and
make peace with oneself, will develop naturally in terms of duration and
skill.
<!--l. 24327--><p class="indent" >   Awareness of the Body
<!--l. 24329--><p class="indent" >   The development of calm is aided by stability, and by a steady but peaceful effort.
If you can&#8217;t feel settled, there is no peacefulness; if there is no effort, you tend to
daydream. One of the most effective postures for the cultivation of the proper
balance of stillness and energy is the sitting posture.
<!--l. 24335--><p class="indent" >   Use a posture that will keep your back straight without strain. A simple
upright chair may be helpful, or you may be able to use the lotus posture.
These postures may look awkward at first, but in time they can provide a
unique balance of gentle firmness that gladdens the mind without tiring the
body.
<!--l. 24341--><p class="indent" >   If the chin is tilted very slightly down this will help but do not allow the head to
loll forward as this encourages drowsiness. Place the hands on your lap, palm
upwards, one gently resting on the other with the thumb-tips touching. Take your
time and get the right balance.
<!--l. 24346--><p class="indent" >   Now, collect your attention, and begin to move it slowly down your body. Notice
the sensations in each part of your body. Relax any tensions, particularly in the face,
neck and hands. Allow the eyelids to close or half close.
<!--l. 24351--><p class="indent" >   Investigate how you are feeling. Are you expectant or tense? Then relax your
attention a little. With this, the mind will probably calm down and you may find
some thoughts drifting in - reflections, daydreams, memories, or doubts about
whether you are doing it right! Instead of following or contending with these thought
patterns, bring more attention to the body, which is a useful anchor for a wandering
mind.
<!--l. 24358--><p class="indent" >   Cultivate a spirit of inquiry in your meditation attitude. Take your time. Move
your attention, for example, systematically from the crown of the head down over the
whole body. Notice the different sensations - such as warmth, pulsing, numbness, and
sensitivity - in the joints of each finger, the moisture of the palms, and the pulse in

the wrist. Even areas that may have no particular sensation, such as the forearms or
the earlobes can be "swept over" in an attentive way. Notice how even the lack of
sensation is something the mind can be aware of. This constant and sustained
investigation is called mindfulness (sati) and is one of the primary tools of Insight
Meditation.
<!--l. 24370--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness of breathing - anapanasati
<!--l. 24372--><p class="indent" >   Instead of "body sweeping", or after a preliminary period of this practice,
mindfulness can be developed through attention on the breath.
<!--l. 24376--><p class="indent" >   First, follow the sensation of your ordinary breath as it flows in through the
nostrils and fills the chest and abdomen. Then try maintaining your attention at one
point, either at the diaphragm or - a more refined location - at the nostrils. Breath
has a tranquilising quality, steady and relaxing if you don&#8217;t force it; this is helped by
an upright posture. Your mind may wander, but keep patiently returning to the
breath.
<!--l. 24383--><p class="indent" >   It is not necessary to develop concentration to the point of excluding everything
else except the breath. Rather than to create a trance, the purpose here is to allow
you to notice the workings of the mind, and to bring a measure of peaceful clarity
into it. The entire process - gathering your attention, noticing the breath, noticing
that the mind has wandered, and re-establishing your attention - develops
mindfulness, patience and insightful understanding. So don&#8217;t be put off by apparent
"failure" - simply begin again. Continuing in this way allows the mind eventually to
calm down.
<!--l. 24393--><p class="indent" >   If you get very restless or agitated, just relax. Practice being at peace with
yourself, listening to - without necessarily believing in - the voices of the
mind.
<!--l. 24397--><p class="indent" >   If you feel drowsy, then put more care and attention into your body and posture.
Refining your attention or pursuing tranquillity at such times will only make matters
worse!
<!--l. 24401--><p class="indent" >   Walking and Standing
<!--l. 24403--><p class="indent" >   Many meditation exercises, such as the above "mindfulness of breathing", are
practised while sitting. However, walking is commonly alternated with sitting as a
form of meditation. Apart from giving you different things to notice, it is a skilful
way to energise the practice if the calming effect of sitting is making you
dull.
<!--l. 24410--><p class="indent" >   If you have access to some open land, measure off about 25-30 paces&#8217; length of
level ground (r a clearly defined pathway between two trees), as your meditation
path. Stand at one end of the path, and compose your mind on the sensations of the
body. First, let the attention rest on the feeling of the body standing upright,
with the arms hanging naturally and the hands lightly clasped in front or
behind. Allow the eyes to gaze at a point about three meters in front of you
at ground level, thus avoiding visual distraction. Now, walk gently, at a
deliberate but &#8217;normal&#8217; pace, to the end of the path. Stop. Focus on the
body standing for the period of a couple of breaths. Turn, and walk back
again. While walking, be aware of the general flow of physical sensations, or
more closely direct your attention to the feet. The exercise for the mind is
to keep bringing its attention back to the sensation of the feet touching

the ground, the spaces between each step, and the feelings of stopping and
starting.
<!--l. 24426--><p class="indent" >   Of course, the mind will wander. So it is important to cultivate patience,
and the resolve to begin again. Adjust the pace to suit your state of mind -
vigorous when drowsy or trapped in obsessive thought, firm but gentle when
restless and impatient. At the end of the path, stop; breathe in and out;
&#8217;let go&#8217; of any restlessness, worry, calm, bliss, memories or opinions about
yourself. The &#8217;inner chatter&#8217; may stop momentarily, or fade out. Begin again. In
this way you continually refresh the mind, and allow it to settle at its own
rate.
<!--l. 24435--><p class="indent" >   In more confined spaces, alter the length of the path to suit what is available.
Alternatively, you can circumambulate a room, pausing after each circumambulation
for a few moments of standing. This period of standing can be extended to several
minutes, using &#8217;body sweeping&#8217;.
<!--l. 24440--><p class="indent" >   Walking brings energy and fluidity into the practice, so keep your pace steady and
just let changing conditions pass through the mind. Rather than expecting the mind
to be as still as it might be while sitting, contemplate the flow of phenomena. It is
remarkable how many times we can become engrossed in a train of thought - arriving
at the end of the path and &#8217;coming to&#8217; with a start! - but it is natural for our
untrained minds to become absorbed in thoughts and moods. So instead of giving in
to impatience, learn how to let go, and begin again. A sense of ease and calm may
then arise, allowing the mind to become open and clear in a natural, unforced
way.
<!--l. 24451--><p class="indent" >   Lying Down
<!--l. 24453--><p class="indent" >   Reclining at the end of a day, spend a few minutes meditating while lying on one
side. Keep the body quite straight and bend one arm up so that the hand acts as a
support for the head. Sweep through the body, resting its stresses; or collect your
attention on the breath, consciously putting aside memories of the day just past and
expectations of tomorrow. In a few minutes, with your mind clear, you&#8217;ll be able to
rest well.
<!--l. 24461--><p class="indent" >   Cultivating The Heart
<!--l. 24463--><p class="indent" >   Cultivating goodwill (metta) gives another dimension to the practice of Insight.
Meditation naturally teaches patience and tolerance or at least it shows the
importance of these qualities. So you may well wish to develop a more friendly and
caring attitude towards yourself and other people. In meditation, you can cultivate
goodwill very realistically.
<!--l. 24469--><p class="indent" >   Focus attention on the breath, which you will now be using as the means of
spreading kindness and goodwill. Begin with yourself, with your body. Visualise the
breath as a light, or see your awareness as being a warm ray and gradually sweep it
over your body. Lightly focus your attention on the centre of the chest, around the
heart region. As you breath in, direct patient kindness towards yourself, perhaps with
the thought, "May I be well", or "Peace". As you breathe out, let the mood of
that thought, or the awareness of light, spread outwards from the heart,
through the body, through the mind and beyond yourself. "May others be
well".
<!--l. 24481--><p class="indent" >   If you are experiencing negative states of mind, breathe in the qualities of

tolerance and forgiveness. Visualizing the breath as having a healing colour may be
helpful. On the out-breath, let go of any stress, worry or negativity, and
extend the sense of release through the body, the mind, and beyond, as
before.
<!--l. 24487--><p class="indent" >   This practice can form all or part of a period of meditation - you have to judge
for yourself what is appropriate. The calming effect of meditating with a kind
attitude is good for beginning a sitting but there will no doubt be times to use this
approach for long periods, to go deeply into the heart.
<!--l. 24493--><p class="indent" >   Always begin with what you are aware of, even if it seems trivial or confused. Let
your mind rest calmly on that-whether it&#8217;s boredom, an aching knee, or the
frustration of not feeling particularly kindly. Allow these to be; practice being at
peace with them. Recognise and gently put aside any tendencies towards laziness,
doubt or guilt.
<!--l. 24499--><p class="indent" >   Peacefulness can develop into a very nourishing kindness towards yourself, if you
first of all accept the presence of what you dislike. Keep the attention steady,
and open the heart to whatever you experience. This does not imply the
approval of negative states, but allows them a space wherein they can come and
go.
<!--l. 24505--><p class="indent" >   Generating goodwill toward the world beyond yourself follows much the same
pattern. A simple way to spread kindness is to work in stages. Start with
yourself, joining the sense of loving acceptance to the movement of the breath.
"May I be well." Then, reflect on people you love and respect, and wish
them well, one by one. Move on to friendly acquaintances, then to those
towards whom you feel indifferent. "May they be well." Finally, bring to
mind those people you fear or dislike, and continue to send out wishes of
goodwill.
<!--l. 24515--><p class="indent" >   This meditation can expand, in a movement of compassion, to include all people
in the world, in their many circumstances. And remember, you don&#8217;t have to feel that
you love everyone in order to wish them well!
<!--l. 24520--><p class="indent" >   Kindness and compassion originate from the same source of good will, and they
broaden the mind beyond the purely personal perspective. If you&#8217;re not always trying
to make things go the way you want them to: if you&#8217;re more accepting and receptive
to yourself and others as they are, compassion arises by itself. Compassion is the
natural sensitivity of the heart.

<!--l. 24540--><p class="indent" >   When embraced, the rod of violence breeds danger &amp; fear: Look at people
quarreling. I will tell of how I experienced dismay. Seeing people floundering like fish

in small puddles, competing with one another &#8212; as I saw this, fear came into me.
The world was entirely without substance. All the directions were knocked out of
line. Wanting a haven for myself, I saw nothing that wasn&#8217;t laid claim to. Seeing
nothing in the end but competition, I felt discontent. And then I saw an arrow here,
so very hard to see, embedded in the heart. Overcome by this arrow you run in all
directions. But simply on pulling it out you don&#8217;t run, you don&#8217;t sink... Whatever
things are tied down in the world, you shouldn&#8217;t be set on them. Having totally
penetrated sensual pleasures, sensual passions, you should train for your own
Unbinding.
<!--l. 24554--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Sn 4.15
<!--l. 24556--><p class="indent" >   In this short autobiographical passage, the Buddha describes his sense of dismay
at the violence in the world, together with his important discovery: that the only
escape from violence is to remove the causes of violence from one&#8217;s own heart. To
remove these causes, one must first refrain from violence on the external level so as to
create the proper karmic context &#8212; more peaceful and honest &#8212; for extracting the
causes of violence on the internal level. The following passages from the Pali canon
illustrate these two levels of the practice, starting first with a few considerations on
the principle of kamma (karma). For a more complete background on kamma, see
the study guide on that topic. The concluding passages in this collection
focus on the concept of "papañca," or complication, as the internal cause
of conflict. For a discussion of this concept, see the Introduction to MN
18.

Drawing the parallel to yourself, neither kill nor get others to kill. Whoever takes a
rod to harm living beings desiring ease, when he himself is looking for ease, will meet
with no ease after death. Whoever doesn&#8217;t take a rod to harm living beings desiring
ease, when he himself is looking for ease, will meet with ease after death. Speak
harshly to no one, or the words will be thrown right back at you. Contentious talk is
painful, for you get struck by rods in return. If, like a flattened metal pot

<!--l. 24589--><p class="indent" >   On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika
Mango Grove. Then Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on
arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to
the Blessed One: "The brahmans of the Western lands, lord &#8212; those who carry water
pots, wear garlands of water plants, purify with water, &amp; worship fire &#8212; can take
[the spirit of] a dead person, lift it out, instruct it, &amp; send it to heaven. But the
Blessed One, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so that all the world, at
the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly
world."
<!--l. 24601--><p class="indent" >   "Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter. Answer as you see
fit. What do you think: There is the case where a man is one who takes life, steals,

indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, &amp; idle
chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to wrong views. Then a great
crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate
with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] &#8217;May this man, at

prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &#8212; at the

his wealth. Maddened with anger, he destroys his status. Relatives, friends, &amp;
colleagues avoid him. Anger brings loss. Anger inflames the mind. He doesn&#8217;t realize
that his danger is born from within. An angry person doesn&#8217;t know his own
benefit. An angry person doesn&#8217;t see the Dhamma. A man conquered by
anger is in a mass of darkness. He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they

were good, but later, when his anger is gone, he suffers as if burned with
fire. He is spoiled, blotted out, like fire enveloped in smoke. When anger
spreads, when a man becomes angry, he has no shame, no fear of evil, is not
respectful in speech. For a person overcome with anger, nothing gives light. I&#8217;ll
list the deeds that bring remorse, that are far from the teachings. Listen!
An angry person kills his father, kills his mother, kills Brahmans &amp; people
run-of-the-mill. It&#8217;s because of a mother&#8217;s devotion that one sees the world, yet
an angry run-of-the-mill person can kill this giver of life. Like oneself, all
beings hold themselves most dear, yet an angry person, deranged, can kill
himself in many ways: with a sword, taking poison, hanging himself by a rope
in a mountain glen. Doing these deeds that kill beings and do violence to
himself, the angry person doesn&#8217;t realize that he&#8217;s ruined. This snare of
Mara, in the form of anger, dwelling in the cave of the heart: cut it out
with self-control, discernment, persistence, right view. The wise man would
cut out each &amp; every form of unskillfulness. Train yourselves: &#8217;May we not
be blotted out.&#8217; Free from anger &amp; untroubled, free from greed, without
longing, tamed, your anger abandoned, free from fermentation, you will be
unbound.

sensuality. In dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the

<!--l. 26272--><p class="indent" >   1.Complication = papañca. As one writer has noted, the word papañca has had a
wide variety of meanings in Indian thought, with only one constant: in Buddhist
philosophical discourse it carries negative connotations, usually of falsification and
distortion. The word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness, spreading,
proliferating. The Pali Commentaries define papañca as covering three types of
thought: craving, conceit, and views. They also note that it functions to slow the
mind down in its escape from the cycle of rebirth, to create baneful distinctions and
unnecessary issues. For these reasons, I have chosen to render the word as
"complication," although some of the following alternatives might be acceptable as
well: self-reflexive thinking, reification, proliferation, exaggeration, elaboration,
distortion. The word offers some interesting parallels to the postmodern
notion of logocentric thinking, but it&#8217;s important to note that the Buddha&#8217;s
program of deconstructing this process differs sharply from that of postmodern

thought.

Having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu, after the meal, returning from his

<!--l. 26302--><p class="indent" >   Dandapani ("Stick-in-hand") the Sakyan, out roaming &amp; rambling for

he exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly
greetings &amp; courtesies, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said
to the Blessed One, "What is the contemplative&#8217;s doctrine? What does he
proclaim?"
<!--l. 26311--><p class="indent" >   "The sort of doctrine, friend, where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in

said to the Blessed One, "Lord, what sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep

<!--l. 26604--><p class="indent" >   1.As other passages in this poem indicate (see note 5, below), the goal is not
measured in terms of knowledge, but as this passage points out, knowledge is a
necessary part of the path to the goal.2.According to Nd.I, this passage is describing
the four formless jhanas, but as the first three of the formless jhanas involve
perception (of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness), only the fourth
of the formless jhanas &#8212; the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception &#8212;
would fit this description.3.Complication-classifications (papañca-sankha): The
mind&#8217;s tendency to read distinctions and differentiations even into the simplest
experience of the present, thus giving rise to views that can issue in conflict. As Sn
4.14 points out, the root of these classifications is the perception, "I am the
thinker." For further discussion of this point, see note 1 to that discourse
and the introduction to MN 18.4."Spirit" is the usual rendering of the Pali
word, yakkha. According to Nd.I, however, in this context the word yakkha
means person, individual, human being, or living being.5.In other words,
the sage knows that both groups in the previous stanza fall back on their
knowledge as a measure of the goal, without comprehending the dependency still
latent in their knowledge. The sages in the first group are mistaking the
experience of neither perception nor non-perception as the goal, and so they
are still dependent on that state of concentration. The sages in the second
group, by the fact that they claim to be skilled, show that there is still a
latent conceit in their Awakening-like experience, and thus it is not totally
independent of clinging. (For more on this point, see MN 102, quoted in
The Mind Like Fire Unbound, pp. 81-82.) Both groups still maintain the
concept of a "spirit" that is purified in the realization of purity. Once these
dependencies are comprehended, one gains release from disputes and from
states of becoming and not-becoming. It is in this way that knowledge is a
means to the goal, but the goal itself is not measured or defined in terms of
knowledge.

thinker.&#8217;1 He should train, always mindful, to subdue any craving inside him.
Whatever truth he may know, within or without, he shouldn&#8217;t get entrenched in
connection with it, for that isn&#8217;t called Unbinding by the good. He shouldn&#8217;t, because
of it, think himself better, lower, or equal. Touched by contact in various ways, he
shouldn&#8217;t keep conjuring self. Stilled right within, a monk shouldn&#8217;t seek
peace from another, from anything else. For one stilled right within, there&#8217;s
nothing embraced, so how rejected? Nothing that&#8217;s self, so from whence would
there be against-self?2 As in the middle of the sea it is still, with no waves

upwelling, so the monk &#8212; unperturbed, still &#8212; should not swell himself

<!--l. 26659--><p class="indent" >   1.On complication-classifications and their role in leading to conflict, see Sn
4.11 and the introduction to MN 18. The perception, "I am the thinker"
lies at the root of these classifications in that it reads into the immediate
present a set of distinctions &#8212; I/not-I; being/not-being; thinker/thought;
identity/non-identity &#8212; that then can proliferate into mental and physical conflict.
The conceit inherent in this perception thus forms a fetter on the mind. To
become unbound, one must learn to examine these distinctions &#8212; which we all
take for granted &#8212; to see that they are simply assumptions that are not
inherent in experience, and that we would be better off to be able to drop
them.2."Embraced/rejected, self/against-self" &#8212; a pun on the pair of Pali words,
atta/nirattam.

<!--l. 26712--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 26714--><p class="indent" >   Shortly after her ordination, the Buddha&#8217;s step-mother, Mahapajapati
Gotami, asked him for a short Dhamma-instruction that would guide her in her
solitary practice. He responded with eight principles for recognizing what
qualifies as Dhamma and Vinaya, and what does not. The commentary tells us
that after her instruction, Mahapajapati Gotami in no long time became an
arahant.

<!--l. 26721--><p class="indent" >   The eight principles have been widely cited ever since. One Thai writer has called
them the "constitution of Buddhism" as they form the standards against which the
validity of any interpretation of the Dhamma or Vinaya must be judged. Perhaps the
most important point that these principles make is that any teaching has to be
judged by the results that come when putting it into practice. They are an excellent
illustration of the teachings given in the well-known Kalama Sutta (AN 3.65),
as well as in the teachings that the Buddha gave to his son, Rahula (MN
61).
<!--l. 26731--><p class="indent" >   The Canon illustrates these principles not only with abstract discussions but also
with stories, and the stories are often more memorable than the discussions. Thus
this study guide differs from its companions in that it is predominantly composed of
stories. Bear in mind as you read the stories that they are often framed in somewhat
extreme terms to drive their points home. Sister Subha [§1.4], Kali [§2.10], Prince
Dighavu [§3.3], and the monk whose limbs are being removed by a saw [§2.10]
would not be as memorable if their stories were framed in more realistic
terms.
<!--l. 26741--><p class="indent" >   Also bear in mind that there is some overlap among the principles, and that a
passage may illustrate more than one at a time. Thus, for instance, the
story of Ven. Isidatta [§2.11] analyzes the fetter of self-identity views, at the
same time illustrating the principles of modesty and non-entanglement. The
most extensive overlap is between the principle of dispassion and that of not
being fettered, as passion in its various forms covers three of the ten fetters
that bind a person to the round of rebirth. Thus the section on dispassion
contains passages dealing with how to overcome the three "passion fetters" &#8212;
sensual passion, passion for the sense of form experienced in the jhanas of
form, and passion for the sense of formlessness experienced in the formless
jhanas &#8212; whereas the section on being unfettered treats the remaining seven
fetters.
<!--l. 26755--><p class="indent" >   The Eight Principles
<!--l. 26757--><p class="indent" >   I have heard that at on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vesali, in the
Peaked Roof Hall in the Great Forest.
<!--l. 26760--><p class="indent" >   Then Mahapajapati Gotami went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having
bowed down to him, stood to one side. As she was standing there she said to him: "It
would be good, lord, if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such
that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, secluded,
heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute."

<!--l. 26829--><p class="indent" >   "Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the eye,
disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with consciousness at the eye, disenchanted
with contact at the eye. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact

are out of your mind?&#8217; &#8217;Your eyes are like those of a fawn, like those of a
sprite in the mountains. Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the
more. Like tips they are, of blue lotuses, in your golden face &#8212; spotless:
Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight grows all the more. Even if you should
go far away, I will think only of your pure, long-lashed gaze, for there is
nothing dearer to me than your eyes, O nymph with the languid regard.&#8217;
&#8217;You want to stray from the road, you want the moon as a plaything, you
want to jump over Mount Sineru, you who have designs on one born of the
Buddha. For there is nothing anywhere at all in the cosmos with its gods, that
would be an object of passion for me. I don&#8217;t even know what that passion
would be, for it&#8217;s been killed, root &amp; all, by the path. Like embers from
a pit &#8212; scattered, like a bowl of poison &#8212; evaporated, I don&#8217;t even see
what that passion would be, for it&#8217;s been killed, root &amp; all, by the path.
Try to seduce one who hasn&#8217;t reflected on this, or who has not followed the
Master&#8217;s teaching. But try it with this one who knows and you suffer. For in
the midst of praise &amp; blame, pleasure &amp; pain, my mindfulness stands firm.
Knowing the unattractiveness of things compounded, my mind cleaves to
nothing at all. I am a follower of the one well-gone, riding the vehicle of the
eightfold way: My arrow removed, effluent-free, I delight, having gone to an
empty dwelling. For I have seen well-painted puppets, hitched up with sticks
&amp; strings, made to dance in various ways. When the sticks &amp; strings are
removed, thrown away, scattered, shredded, smashed into pieces, not to
be found, in what will the mind there make its home? This body of mine,
which is just like that, when devoid of dhammas doesn&#8217;t function. When,
devoid of dhammas, it doesn&#8217;t function, in what will the mind there make its
home? Like a mural you&#8217;ve seen, painted on a wall, smeared with yellow
orpiment, there your vision has been distorted, meaningless your human
perception. Like an evaporated mirage, like a tree of gold in a dream, like a
magic show in the midst of a crowd &#8212; you run blind after what is unreal.
Resembling a ball of sealing wax, set in a hollow, with a bubble in the middle and
bathed with tears, eye secretions are born there too: The parts of the eye are
rolled all together in various ways.&#8217; Plucking out her lovely eye, with mind
unattached she felt no regret. &#8217;Here, take this eye. It&#8217;s yours.&#8217; Straightaway she

gave it to him. Straightaway his passion faded right there, and he begged
her forgiveness. &#8217;Be well, follower of the holy life. This sort of thing won&#8217;t
happen again. Harming a person like you is like embracing a blazing fire.
It&#8217;s as if I have seized a poisonous snake. So may you be well. Forgive me.&#8217;
And released from there, the nun went to the excellent Buddha&#8217;s presence.
When she saw the mark of his excellent merit, her eye became as it was
before.

<!--l. 26979--><p class="indent" >   Now at that time Ven. Anuruddha, going through the Kosalan countryside on his
way to Savatthi, arrived in the evening at a certain village. And at that time a rest
house had been set up by a woman in that village. So Ven. Anuruddha went to the
woman and, on arrival, said to her, "If it is no inconvenience for you, sister, I will
stay for one night in the rest house."
<!--l. 26986--><p class="indent" >   "You are welcome to stay, venerable sir."
<!--l. 26988--><p class="indent" >   Then other travelers went to that woman and, on arrival, said, "If it is no

<!--l. 26992--><p class="indent" >   "This master has arrived first. If he gives his permission, you may stay."
<!--l. 26995--><p class="indent" >   So the travelers went to Ven. Anuruddha and on arrival said to him, "If it is no

<!--l. 26999--><p class="indent" >   "You are welcome to stay, friends."
<!--l. 27001--><p class="indent" >   Now it so happened that the woman had fallen in love with Ven. Anuruddha at
first sight, so she went to him and said, "The master will not be comfortable,
crowded with these people. It would be good if I were to prepare a bed inside for the
master."
<!--l. 27006--><p class="indent" >   Ven. Anuruddha consented by remaining silence.
<!--l. 27008--><p class="indent" >   Then the woman, having herself prepared a bed inside for Ven. Anuruddha,
having put on her jewelry and scented herself with perfumes, went to him and
said, "Master, you are beautiful, good-looking, and appealing. I, too, am
beautiful, good-looking, &amp; appealing. It would be good if I were to be your
wife."
<!--l. 27014--><p class="indent" >   When this was said, Ven. Anuruddha remained silent. So a second time... A third
time she said to him, "Master, you are beautiful, good-looking, &amp; appealing. I too am
beautiful, good-looking, &amp; appealing. Please take me together with all my
wealth."
<!--l. 27019--><p class="indent" >   A third time, Ven. Anuruddha remained silent. So the woman, having slipped off
her upper cloak, paraded up &amp; down in front of him, stood, sat down, &amp; then lay
down right in front of him. But Ven. Anuruddha, keeping control of his faculties,
didn&#8217;t as much as glance at her or say even a word.
<!--l. 27025--><p class="indent" >   Then the thought occurred to her: "Isn&#8217;t it amazing! Isn&#8217;t it astounding! Many
men send for me at a price of 100 or even 1,000 (a night), but this contemplative,
even when I myself beg him, doesn&#8217;t want to take me together with all of my
wealth!" So, putting her upper cloak back on and bowing her head at his feet, she
said to him: "Venerable sir, a transgression has overcome me in that I was so foolish,
so muddle-headed, &amp; so unskillful as to act in such a way. Please accept this

confession of my transgression as such, so that I may restrain myself in the
future."
<!--l. 27035--><p class="indent" >   "Yes, sister, a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish, so
muddle-headed, &amp; so unskillful as to act in such a way. But because you
see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the
Dhamma, we accept your confession. For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma
&amp; Discipline of the noble ones when, seeing a transgression as such, one
makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the
future."
<!--l. 27043--><p class="indent" >   Then, when the night had passed, the woman, with her own hand, served &amp;
satisfied Ven. Anuruddha with excellent staple and non-staple food. When Ven.
Anuruddha had eaten &amp; removed his hand from his bowl, she sat to one side. As she
was sitting there, Ven. Anuruddha instructed, urged, roused, &amp; encouraged her
with a talk on Dhamma. Then the woman, having been instructed, urged,
roused, &amp; encouraged by Ven. Anuruddha with a talk on Dhamma, said to
him, "Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place
upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to
one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes
could see forms, in the same way has Ven. Anuruddha &#8212; through many
lines of reasoning &#8212; made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for
refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May the master
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for
life."

He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure

from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded

permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were sitting

then even though that he may be well-bathed, well-anointed, dressed in
white clothes, his hair &amp; beard neatly trimmed, he is ugly nevertheless, all

he sleeps on a bed spread with a white blanket, spread with a woolen coverlet, spread
with a flower-embroidered bedspread, covered with a rug of deerskins, with a canopy

opposition [to the truth], they lead to his long-term suffering &amp; loss, all

<!--l. 27574--><p class="indent" >   An angry person is ugly &amp; sleeps poorly. Gaining a profit, he turns it into a loss,
having done damage with word &amp; deed. A person overwhelmed with anger destroys
his wealth. Maddened with anger, he destroys his status. Relatives, friends, &amp;
colleagues avoid him. Anger brings loss. Anger inflames the mind. He doesn&#8217;t realize
that his danger is born from within. An angry person doesn&#8217;t know his own
benefit. An angry person doesn&#8217;t see the Dhamma. A man conquered by
anger is in a mass of darkness. He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they
were good, but later, when his anger is gone, he suffers as if burned with
fire. He is spoiled, blotted out, like fire enveloped in smoke. When anger
spreads, when a man becomes angry, he has no shame, no fear of evil, is not
respectful in speech. For a person overcome with anger, nothing gives light. I&#8217;ll
list the deeds that bring remorse, that are far from the teachings. Listen!
An angry person kills his father, kills his mother, kills Brahmans &amp; people
run-of-the-mill. It&#8217;s because of a mother&#8217;s devotion that one sees the world, yet
an angry run-of-the-mill person can kill this giver of life. Like oneself, all
beings hold themselves most dear, yet an angry person, deranged, can kill
himself in many ways: with a sword, taking poison, hanging himself by a rope
in a mountain glen. Doing these deeds that kill beings and do violence to
himself, the angry person doesn&#8217;t realize that he&#8217;s ruined. This snare of
Mara, in the form of anger, dwelling in the cave of the heart: cut it out
with self-control, discernment, persistence, right view. The wise man would
cut out each &amp; every form of unskillfulness. Train yourselves: &#8217;May we not
be blotted out.&#8217; Free from anger &amp; untroubled, free from greed, without
longing, tamed, your anger abandoned, free from fermentation, you will be
unbound.

flare up at someone who&#8217;s angry. Whoever doesn&#8217;t flare up at someone who&#8217;s angry
wins a battle hard to win. You live for the good of both &#8212; your own, the other&#8217;s &#8212;
when, knowing the other&#8217;s provoked, you mindfully grow calm. When you work the
cure of both &#8212; your own, the other&#8217;s &#8212; those who think you a fool know nothing of
Dhamma.
<!--l. 27660--><p class="indent" >   When this was said, the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One,
"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what
was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or
to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same
way has Master Gotama &#8212; through many lines of reasoning &#8212; made the Dhamma
clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of
monks. Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotama&#8217;s presence, let me obtain
admission."
<!--l. 27670--><p class="indent" >   Then the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja received the going forth &amp; the

dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute &#8212; he in no long time reached &amp;
remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth
from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now.

intimacies. Rid of sensual passions, free from yearning, he wouldn&#8217;t engage
with people in quarrelsome debate. Those things aloof from which he should
go about in the world: the great one wouldn&#8217;t take them up &amp; argue for
them. As the prickly lotus is unsmeared by water &amp; mud, so the sage, an
exponent of peace, without greed, is unsmeared by sensuality &amp; the world.
An attainer-of-wisdom isn&#8217;t measured made proud by views or by what is
thought, for he isn&#8217;t affected by them. He wouldn&#8217;t be led by action, learning;
doesn&#8217;t reach a conclusion in any entrenchments. For one dispassionate toward
perception there are no ties; for one released by discernment, no delusions.
Those who grasp at perceptions &amp; views go about butting their heads in the

vehicles, lands, armories, &amp; granaries of King Dighiti, lived in lordship over
them.
<!--l. 28268--><p class="indent" >   Meanwhile, King Dighiti had set out for Varanasi together with his consort and,
traveling by stages, arrived there. There he lived with her on the outskirts of
Varanasi in a potter&#8217;s house, disguised as a wanderer. Not long afterwards, she
became pregnant. She had a pregnancy wish of this sort: she wanted to see a fourfold
army, armed &amp; arrayed, standing on a parade ground at dawn, and to drink
the water used for washing the swords. She said to King Dighiti, "Your
majesty, I am pregnant, and I have a pregnancy wish of this sort: I want
to see a fourfold army, armed &amp; arrayed, standing on a parade ground at
dawn, and to drink the water used for washing the swords." He said, "My
queen, where is there for us &#8212; fallen on hard times &#8212; a fourfold army, armed
&amp; arrayed, standing on a parade ground, and water used for washing the
swords?"
<!--l. 28282--><p class="indent" >   "If I don&#8217;t get this, your majesty, I will die."
<!--l. 28284--><p class="indent" >   Now at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of King
Dighiti. So King Dighiti went to him and, on arrival, said, "A lady friend of yours,
old friend, is pregnant, and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort: she wants to see a
fourfold army, armed &amp; arrayed, standing on a parade ground at dawn, and to drink
the water used for washing the swords."
<!--l. 28291--><p class="indent" >   "In that case, let me see her."
<!--l. 28293--><p class="indent" >   So King Dighiti&#8217;s consort went to King Brahmadatta&#8217;s brahman adviser. When he
saw her coming from afar, he rose from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder
and, with his hands raised in salutation to her, exclaimed three times, "Surely the
king of Kosala has come to your womb! Surely the king of Kosala has come to your
womb! Don&#8217;t be worried, my queen. You will get to see a fourfold army, armed &amp;
arrayed, standing on a parade ground at dawn, and to drink the water used for
washing the swords."
<!--l. 28302--><p class="indent" >   Then he went to King Brahmadatta and, on arrival, said to him, "Your majesty,
signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army, armed &amp;
arrayed, should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be
washed."
<!--l. 28307--><p class="indent" >   So King Brahmadatta ordered his people, "I say, then: Do as the brahman adviser
says." Thus King Dighiti&#8217;s chief consort got to see a fourfold army, armed &amp; arrayed,
standing on a parade ground at dawn, and got to drink the water used for washing
the swords. Then, with the maturing of the fetus, she gave birth to a son, whom they
named Dighavu (LongLife). Not long afterwards, Prince Dighavu reached the age of
discretion. The thought occurred to King Dighiti, "This King Brahmadatta
of Kasi has done us great harm. He has seized our troops, vehicles, lands,
armories, &amp; granaries. If he finds out about us, he will have all three of
us killed. Why don&#8217;t I send Prince Dighavu to live outside of the city?"
So Prince Dighavu, having gone to live outside of the city, learned all the
crafts.
<!--l. 28321--><p class="indent" >   Now at that time King Dighiti&#8217;s barber had gone over to King Brahmadatta. He

saw King Dighiti, together with his consort, living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a
potter&#8217;s house, disguised as a wanderer. On seeing them, he went to King
Brahmadatta and, on arrival, said to him, "Your majesty, King Dighiti of Kosala,
together with his consort, is living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter&#8217;s house,
disguised as a wanderer."
<!--l. 28328--><p class="indent" >   So King Brahmadatta ordered his people, "I say, then: go fetch King Dighiti
together with his consort."
<!--l. 28331--><p class="indent" >   Responding, "As you say, your majesty," they went and fetched King Dighiti
together with his consort.
<!--l. 28334--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta ordered his people, "I say, then: having bound King
Dighiti &amp; his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly against their
backs, and having shaved them bald, march them to a harsh-sounding drum from
street to street, crossroads to crossroads, evict them out the south gate of the city
and there, to the south of the city, cut them into four pieces and bury them in holes
placed in the four directions."
<!--l. 28342--><p class="indent" >   Responding, "As you say, your majesty," the king&#8217;s people bound King Dighiti &amp;
his consort with a stout rope, pinning their arms tightly against their backs, shaved
them bald, and marched them to a harsh-sounding drum from street to street,
crossroads to crossroads.
<!--l. 28348--><p class="indent" >   Then the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu, "It&#8217;s been a long time since I saw
my mother &amp; father. What if I were to go see them?" So he entered Varanasi
and saw his mother &amp; father bound with a stout rope, their arms pinned
tightly against their backs, their heads shaven bald, being marched to a
harsh-sounding drum from street to street, crossroads to crossroads. So he went to
them. King Dighiti saw Prince Dighavu coming from afar, and on seeing him,
said, "Don&#8217;t, my dear Dighavu, be far-sighted. Don&#8217;t be near-sighted. For
vengeance is not settled through vengeance. Vengeance is settled through
non-vengeance."
<!--l. 28359--><p class="indent" >   When this was said, the people said to him, "This King Dighiti has gone crazy.
He&#8217;s talking nonsense. Who is Dighavu? Why is he saying, &#8217;Don&#8217;t, my dear Dighavu,
be far-sighted. Don&#8217;t be near-sighted. For vengeance is not settled through vengeance.
Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance&#8217;?"
<!--l. 28365--><p class="indent" >   "I&#8217;m not crazy or talking nonsense. He who knows will understand." Then a
second time... a third time he said, "Don&#8217;t, my dear Dighavu, be far-sighted. Don&#8217;t
be near-sighted. For vengeance is not settled through vengeance. Vengeance is settled
through non-vengeance."
<!--l. 28371--><p class="indent" >   A third time, the people said to him, "This King Dighiti has gone crazy. He&#8217;s
talking nonsense. Who is Dighavu? Why is he saying, &#8217;Don&#8217;t, my dear Dighavu, be
far-sighted. Don&#8217;t be near-sighted. For vengeance is not settled through vengeance.
Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance&#8217;?"
<!--l. 28377--><p class="indent" >   "I&#8217;m not crazy or talking nonsense. He who knows will understand."
<!--l. 28380--><p class="indent" >   Then the king&#8217;s people, having marched King Dighiti together with his chief
consort to a harsh-sounding drum from street to street, crossroads to crossroads,
evicted them out the south gate of the city and there, to the south of the city, cut
them into four pieces, buried them in holes placed in the four directions, stationed
guards, and left.

<!--l. 28387--><p class="indent" >   Then Prince Dighavu, having entered Varanasi, brought out some liquor and got
the guards to drink it. When they had fallen down drunk, he collected sticks,
made a pyre, raised the bodies of his mother &amp; father onto the pyre, set fire
to it, and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in
salutation.
<!--l. 28393--><p class="indent" >   Now at that time, King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his
palace. He saw Prince Dighavu circumambulating the pyre three times with his
hands raised in salutation, and on seeing him, the thought occurred to him,
"Doubtlessly this person is a relative or blood-kinsman of King Dighiti.
Ah, how unfortunate for me, for there is no one who will tell me what this
means!"
<!--l. 28400--><p class="indent" >   Then Prince Dighavu, having gone into the wilderness and having cried &amp; wept as
much as he needed to, dried his tears and entered Varanasi. Going to an elephant
stable next to the king&#8217;s palace, he said to the chief elephant trainer, "Teacher, I
want to learn this craft."
<!--l. 28406--><p class="indent" >   "In that case, young man, you may learn it."
<!--l. 28408--><p class="indent" >   Then, rising in the last watch of the night, Prince Dighavu sang in a sweet voice
and played the lute in the elephant stable. King Brahmadatta, also rising in the last
watch of the night, heard the sweet-voiced singing &amp; lute-playing in the elephant
stable. On hearing it, he asked his people, "I say: Who was that, rising in the last
watch of the night, singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant
stable?"
<!--l. 28416--><p class="indent" >   "Your majesty, a young man &#8212; the student of such-and-such an elephant trainer,
rising in the last watch of the night, was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in
the elephant stable."
<!--l. 28421--><p class="indent" >   "I say, then: go fetch that young man."
<!--l. 28423--><p class="indent" >   Responding, "As you say, your majesty," they went and fetched Prince
Dighavu.
<!--l. 28426--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu, "I say: Was that you rising in
the last watch of the night, singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant
stable?"
<!--l. 28430--><p class="indent" >   "Yes, your majesty."
<!--l. 28432--><p class="indent" >   "I say then, my young man: sing and play the lute."
<!--l. 28434--><p class="indent" >   Responding, "As you say, your majesty," and seeking to win favor, Prince
Dighavu sang with a sweet voice and played the lute.
<!--l. 28438--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta said to him, "I say: You, my young man, are to stay and
attend to me."
<!--l. 28441--><p class="indent" >   "As you say, your majesty," Prince Dighavu replied. Then he rose in the morning
before King Brahmadatta, went to bed in the evening after him, did whatever the
king ordered, always acting to please him, speaking politely to him. And it was not
long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of
trust.
<!--l. 28448--><p class="indent" >   Then one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu, "I say then, my young
man: harness the chariot. I&#8217;m going hunting."
<!--l. 28451--><p class="indent" >   Responding, "As you say, your majesty," Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot
and then said to King Brahmadatta, "Your chariot is harnessed, your majesty. Now

is the time for you to do as you see fit."
<!--l. 28456--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot, and Prince Dighavu drove it. He
drove it in such a way that the king&#8217;s entourage went one way, and the chariot
another. Then, after they had gone far, King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu, "I
say then, my young man: unharness the chariot. I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;m going to lie
down."
<!--l. 28462--><p class="indent" >   Responding, "As you say, your majesty," Prince Dighavu unharnessed the chariot
and sat down cross-legged on the ground. Then King Brahmadatta lay down, placing
his head on Prince Dighavu&#8217;s lap. As he was tired, he went to sleep right away. Then
the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu: "This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done
us great harm. He has seized our troops, vehicles, lands, armories, &amp; granaries. And
it was because of him that my mother &amp; father were killed. Now is my chance to
wreak vengeance!" He drew his sword from his scabbard. But then he thought,
"My father told me, as he was about to die, &#8217;Don&#8217;t, my dear Dighavu, be
far-sighted. Don&#8217;t be near-sighted. For vengeance is not settled through
vengeance. Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance.&#8217; It would not be proper
for me to transgress my father&#8217;s words." So he put his sword back in its
scabbard. A second time... A third time the thought occurred to Prince
Dighavu: "This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harm. He has
seized our troops, vehicles, lands, armories, &amp; granaries. And it was because
of him that my mother &amp; father were killed. Now is my chance to wreak
vengeance!" He drew his sword from his scabbard. But then he thought,
"My father told me, as he was about to die, &#8217;Don&#8217;t, my dear Dighavu, be
far-sighted. Don&#8217;t be near-sighted. For vengeance is not settled through vengeance.
Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance.&#8217; It would not be proper for me to
transgress my father&#8217;s words." So once again he put his sword back in its
scabbard.
<!--l. 28487--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta suddenly got up &#8212; frightened, agitated, unnerved,
alarmed. Prince Dighavu said to him, "Your majesty, why have you gotten up
suddenly &#8212; frightened, agitated, unnerved, &amp; alarmed?"
<!--l. 28492--><p class="indent" >   "I say, my young man: Just now as I was dreaming, Prince Dighavu &#8212; son of
Dighiti, king of Kasi &#8212; struck me down with a sword." Then Prince Dighavu,
grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand, and drawing his sword
from its scabbard with his right, said, "I, your majesty, am that very Prince
Dighavu, son of Dighiti, king of Kasi. You have done us great harm. You have
seized our troops, vehicles, lands, armories, &amp; granaries. And it was because
of you that my mother &amp; father were killed. Now is my chance to wreak
vengeance!"
<!--l. 28502--><p class="indent" >   So King Brahmadatta, dropping his head down to Prince Dighavu&#8217;s feet, said,
"Grant me my life, my dear Dighavu! Grant me my life, my dear Dighavu!"
<!--l. 28506--><p class="indent" >   "Who am I that I would dare grant life to your majesty? It is your majesty who
should grant life to me!"
<!--l. 28509--><p class="indent" >   "In that case, my dear Dighavu, you grant me my life and I grant you your
life."
<!--l. 28512--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta and Prince Dighavu granted one another their lives
and, taking one another by the hands, swore an oath to do one another no

harm.
<!--l. 28516--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu, "In that case, my dear Dighavu,
harness the chariot. We will go on."
<!--l. 28519--><p class="indent" >   Responding, "As you say, your majesty," Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot
and then said to King Brahmadatta, "Your chariot is harnessed, your majesty. Now
is the time for you to do as you see fit."
<!--l. 28524--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot, and Prince Dighavu drove it. He
drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the king&#8217;s
entourage.
<!--l. 28528--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta, having entered Varanasi, had his ministers
&amp; councilors convened and said to them, "I say, then. If you were to see
Prince Dighavu, the son of Dighiti, the king of Kasi, what would you do to
him?"
<!--l. 28533--><p class="indent" >   Different ministers said, "We would cut of his hands, your majesty" &#8212; "We would
cut off his feet, your majesty" &#8212; "We would cut off his hands &amp; feet, your majesty"
&#8212; "We would cut off his ears, your majesty" &#8212; "We would cut off his nose, your
majesty" &#8212; "We would cut off his ears &amp; nose, your majesty" &#8212; "We would cut off
his head, your majesty."
<!--l. 28543--><p class="indent" >   Then the king said, "This, I say, is Prince Dighavu, the son of Dighiti, the king
of Kasi. You are not allowed to do anything to him. It was by him that
my life was granted to me, and it was by me that his life was granted to
him."
<!--l. 28548--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu, "What your father said to you
as he was about to die &#8212; &#8217;Don&#8217;t, my dear Dighavu, be far-sighted. Don&#8217;t be
near-sighted. For vengeance is not settled through vengeance. Vengeance is settled
through non-vengeance&#8217; &#8212; in reference to what did he say that?"
<!--l. 28554--><p class="indent" >   "What my father said to me as he was about to die &#8212; &#8217;Don&#8217;t be far-sighted&#8217; &#8212;
&#8217;Don&#8217;t bear vengeance for a long time&#8217; is what he was saying to me as he was about
to die. And what he said to me as he was about to die &#8212; &#8217;Don&#8217;t be near-sighted&#8217; &#8212;
&#8217;Don&#8217;t be quick to break with a friend&#8217; is what he was saying to me as he was about
to die. And what he said to me as he was about to die &#8212; &#8217;For vengeance is not
settled through vengeance. Vengeance is settled through non-vengeance&#8217; &#8212;
My mother &amp; father were killed by your majesty. If I were to deprive your
majesty of life, those who hope for your majesty&#8217;s well-being would deprive me
of life. And those who hope for my well-being would deprive them of life.
And in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeance. But now
I have been granted my life by your majesty, and your majesty has been
granted your life by me. And in this way vengeance has been settled by
non-vengeance. That is what my father was saying to me as he was about to
die."
<!--l. 28571--><p class="indent" >   Then King Brahmadatta said, "Isn&#8217;t it amazing! Isn&#8217;t it astounding! How wise
this Prince Dighavu is, in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his
father said in brief!" So he returned his father&#8217;s troops, vehicles, lands, armories, &amp;
granaries, and gave him his daughter in marriage.
<!--l. 28577--><p class="indent" >   Such, monks, is the forbearance &amp; gentleness of kings who wield the scepter, who
wield the sword. So now let your light shine forth, so that you &#8212; who have gone

the fetters; undisturbed at the ending of life, wander alone, a rhinoceros.

acts of merit. Your living the holy life, performing the fire sacrifice, will

for unfettering and not for fettering; for letting go and not for clinging? Yet here,
while I have taught the Dhamma for dispassion, you set your heart on passion; while
I have taught the Dhamma for unfettering, you set your heart on being fettered;
while I have taught the Dhamma for letting go, you set your heart on clinging.
Haven&#8217;t I taught the Dhamma in various ways for the fading of passion, the sobering
of pride, the subduing of thirst, the destruction of attachment, the severing of the
round, the depletion of craving, dispassion, cessation, unbinding? Haven&#8217;t I
advocated abandoning sensual pleasures, understanding sensual perceptions,
subduing sensual thirst, destroying sensual preoccupations, calming sensual fevers?...

wisdom than oneself, more skill in concentration and other aspects of the path than
oneself, and those senior to oneself.2. The Commentary says that the right time to
see a teacher is when one is overcome with passion, aversion, and delusion, and
cannot find a way out on one&#8217;s own. This echoes a passage in AN 6.26, in which Ven.
Maha Kaccana says that the right time to visit a "monk worthy of esteem" is
when one needs help in overcoming any of the five hindrances or when one
doesn&#8217;t yet have an appropriate theme to focus on to put an end to the mind&#8217;s
fermentations.3. The Commentary equates "words destructive of the Dhamma" with
"animal talk." See the discussion under Pacittiya 85 in The Buddhist Monastic

<!--l. 31274--><p class="indent" >   The Pali canon recognizes four levels of awakening, the first of which is called
stream-entry. The practices leading up to stream-entry are already discussed in
the first part of this study guide. This second part covers the experience of
stream-entry together with its results. The canonical passages treating the
experience and its results use all three modes of discourse generally employed in
the Canon: the narrative mode &#8212; stories about people who have attained
stream-entry; the cosmological mode &#8212; descriptions of the after-death destinations
awaiting those who have attained stream-entry; and what might be called the
"emptiness" mode, which describes mental states in and of themselves as
they are directly experienced as absent or present, both during and after
stream-entry.
<!--l. 31287--><p class="indent" >   The material in this part of the study guide is presented in five sections. The first
section, The Arising of the Dhamma Eye, discusses the experience of stream-entry,
and concludes with a passage indicating why the experience is described in terms of
the faculty of vision. The second section, The Three Fetters, discusses the three
fetters of renewed existence that are cut with the arising of the Dhamma eye:
self-identity views, uncertainty, and grasping at precepts and practices. The third
section, The Character of the Stream-winner, discusses the personal characteristics of
a stream-winner that flow directly from the cutting of the first three fetters. This
section focuses on three lists of the four factors of stream-entry, which are not to be
confused with the four factors for stream-entry discussed in the first part
of this study guide. The fourth section, Rewards, discusses the rewards of
stream-entry that come both in this life and in future lives. The final section,
Advice, echoes the Buddha&#8217;s last words to his disciples before entering total
nibbana. The discourse reporting those words &#8212; DN 16 &#8212; also reports that the
most backward of the monks present at the Buddha&#8217;s passing away were
stream-winners. The fact that his last words to them stressed the need for
heedfulness underlies the fact that even stream-winners have to be wary of
heedlessness. This is especially true in the present day, when many different
meditation schools define the attainment of stream-entry in such different
terms, raising the question of whose certification of stream-entry is valid
and whose is not. The safest course of action for all meditators &#8212; whether
certified as stream-winners or not, and whether that certification is valid or
not &#8212; is to maintain an attitude of heedfulness with regard to all mental
qualities.
<!--l. 31315--><p class="indent" >   The term "stream" in "stream-entry" refers to the point where all eight factors of

level of belief and discernment may actually guarantee that someday in this

<!--l. 32736--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 32738--><p class="indent" >   In the early centuries after the Buddha&#8217;s passing away, as Buddhism became a
popular religion, the idea was formalized that there were three paths to awakening to
choose from: the path to awakening as a disciple of a Buddha (savaka); the path to
awakening as a private Buddha (pacceka-buddha), i.e., one who attained awakening
on his own but was not able to teach the path of practice to others; and the
path to awakening as a Rightly Self-awakened Buddha (samma sambuddho).
Each path was defined as consisting of perfections (parami) of character,
but there was a question as to what those perfections were and how the
paths differed from one another. The Theravadins, for instance, specified ten
perfections, and organized their Jataka collection so that it culminated in ten
tales, each illustrating one of the perfections. The Sarvastivadins, on the
other hand, specified six perfections, and organized their Jataka collection
accordingly.
<!--l. 32753--><p class="indent" >   All Buddhists agreed that the third path took by far the longest to follow,
but disagreements arose as to whether the perfections developed along the
different paths were quantitatively or qualitatively different. In other words, did
a Buddha develop more of the same sort of perfections that an arahant
developed, or did he develop perfections of a radically different sort? Those who
believed that the perfections differed only quantitatively were able to take
the early Buddhist canons as their guide to the path to Buddhahood, for
they could simply extrapolate from the path of the arahant as described in
those canons. Those seeking Buddhahood who believed that the perfections
differed qualitatively, however, had to look outside the canons. People in
this latter group often practiced a form of meditation aimed at inducing
visions of bodhisattvas treading the path to full Buddhahood, along with
Buddhas in other world-systems. These Buddhas and bodhisattvas &#8212; it was
hoped &#8212; would provide an insider&#8217;s knowledge of the full Buddha&#8217;s path.
The teachings that resulted from these visions were very diverse; not until
the 3rd century C.E., with the development of the Yogacara school, was a
concerted effort made to collate these various teachings into a single body
&#8212; what we now know as the Mahayana movement &#8212; but the differences
among these teachings were so great that the Mahayana never achieved true
unity.
<!--l. 32775--><p class="indent" >   Thus, historically, there have been two major ways of following the path to
full Buddhahood: following guidelines gleaned from the early canons, and
following the traditions set in motion by the experiences of visionaries from the
beginning of the common era. The materials in this study guide take the first

course.
<!--l. 32781--><p class="indent" >   There&#8217;s a common misunderstanding that the Theravada school teaches only the
savaka path, but a glance at Theravada history will show that many Theravadins
have vowed to become bodhisattvas and have undertaken the practice of the ten
perfections as set forth in the Theravadin jatakas. Because these perfections differ
only quantitatively for arahants, Theravadins who aspire to arahantship cite the
perfections as qualities that they are developing as part of their practice outside of
formal meditation. For example, they make donations to develop the perfection of
generosity, undertake building projects to develop the perfection of endurance, and so
forth.
<!--l. 32792--><p class="indent" >   For people in the modern world who are wrestling with the issue of how to
practice the Dhamma in daily life, the perfections provide a useful framework for
developing a fruitful attitude toward daily activities so that any activity or
relationship undertaken wisely with the primary purpose of developing the
perfections in a balanced way becomes part of the practice.
<!--l. 32799--><p class="indent" >   The perfections also provide one of the few reliable ways of measuring the
accomplishments of one&#8217;s life. "Accomplishments" in the realm of work and
relationships have a way of turning into dust, but perfections of the character, once
developed, are dependable and lasting, carrying one over and beyond the vicissitudes
of daily living. Thus they deserve to take high priority in the way we plan our lives.
These two facts are reflected in the two etymologies offered for the word perfection
(parami): They carry one across to the further shore (param); and they
are of foremost (parama) importance in formulating the purpose of one&#8217;s
life.
<!--l. 32810--><p class="indent" >   The material in this study guide is organized under the heading of the eighth
perfection &#8212; determination &#8212; for several reasons. The first reason is that
determination is needed for undertaking the path of perfections to begin with, in
that it gives focus, motivation, and direction to the practice. The second
reason is that the four aspects of skilled determination &#8212; discernment, truth,
relinquishment, and calm &#8212; when studied carefully, cover all ten of the
perfections: generosity, virtue, renunciation, discernment, persistence, endurance,
truth, determination, good will, and equanimity. In this way, the material
gathered here illustrates the general principle that each of the perfections, when
properly practiced, includes all ten. The third reason is that the four aspects of
skilled determination help guard against a common problem in using the
perfections as a guide to practice: a tendency to indulge in the self-delusion
that can justify any activity, no matter how inappropriate, as part of the
path.

<!--l. 32932--><p class="indent" >   What does discernment come from? You might compare it with learning to
become a potter, a tailor, or a basket weaver. The teacher will start out by telling
you how to make a pot, sew a shirt or a pair of pants, or weave different patterns,
but the proportions and beauty of the object you make will have to depend on your
own powers of observation. Suppose you weave a basket and then take a good look at
its proportions, to see if it&#8217;s too short or too tall. If it&#8217;s too short, weave another one,
a little taller, and then take a good look at it to see if there&#8217;s anything that still
needs improving, to see if it&#8217;s too thin or too fat. Then weave another one,
better-looking than the last. Keep this up until you have one that&#8217;s as beautiful and
well-proportioned as possible, one with nothing to criticize from any angle. This
last basket you can take as your standard. You can now set yourself up in
business.
<!--l. 32947--><p class="indent" >   What you&#8217;ve done is to learn from your own actions. As for your previous efforts,
you needn&#8217;t concern yourself with them any longer. Throw them out. This is a
sense of discernment that arises of its own accord, an ingenuity and sense of
judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught you, but from
observing and evaluating on your own the object that you yourself have
made.
<!--l. 32954--><p class="indent" >   The same holds true in practicing meditation. For discernment to arise, you have
to be observant as you keep track of the breath and to gain a sense of how to adjust
and improve it so that it&#8217;s well-proportioned throughout the body &#8212; to the
point where it flows evenly without faltering, so that it&#8217; s comfortable in
slow and out slow, in fast and out fast, long, short, heavy, or refined. Get
so that both the in-breath and the out-breath are comfortable no matter

what way you breathe, so that &#8212; no matter when &#8212; you immediately feel a
sense of ease the moment you focus on the breath. When you can do this,
physical results will appear: a sense of ease and lightness, open and spacious.
The body will be strong, the breath and blood will flow unobstructed and
won&#8217;t form an opening for disease to step in. The body will be healthy and
awake.
<!--l. 32968--><p class="indent" >   As for the mind, when mindfulness and alertness are the causes, a still mind is the
result. When negligence is the cause, a mind distracted and restless is the result. So
we must try to make the causes good, in order to give rise to the good results we&#8217;ve
referred to. If we use our powers of observation and evaluation in caring for the
breath, and are constantly correcting and improving it, we&#8217;ll develop awareness on
our own, the fruit of having developed our concentration higher step by
step.
<!--l. 32977--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Ajaan Lee, Observe &amp; Evaluate
<!--l. 32979--><p class="indent" >   The Dhamma of attainment is something cool, clean, and clear. It doesn&#8217;t take
birth, age, grow ill, or die. Whoever works earnestly at the Dhamma of

yourself...
<!--l. 32985--><p class="indent" >   We should make a point of searching for whatever will give rise to discernment.
Sutamaya-pañña: Listen to things that are worth listening to. Cintamaya-pañña:
Once you&#8217;ve listened, evaluate what you&#8217;ve learned. Don&#8217;t accept it or reject it right
off hand. Bhavanamaya-pañña: Once you&#8217;ve put what you&#8217;ve learned to the test,
practice in line with it. This is the highest perfection of discernment &#8212; liberating
insight. You know what kinds of stress and pain should be remedied and so
you remedy them. You know what kinds shouldn&#8217;t be remedied and so you
don&#8217;t.
<!--l. 32995--><p class="indent" >   For the most part we&#8217;re really ignorant. We try to remedy the things that
shouldn&#8217;t be remedied, and it just doesn&#8217;t work &#8212; because there&#8217;s one kind of
stress that should simply be observed and shouldn&#8217;t be fiddled with at all.
Like a rusty watch: Don&#8217;t polish away any more rust than you should. If
you go taking it apart, the whole thing will stop running for good. What
this means is that once you&#8217;ve seen natural conditions for what they truly
are, you have to let them be. If you see something that should be fixed,
you fix it. Whatever shouldn&#8217;t be fixed, you don&#8217;t. This takes a load off the
heart.
<!--l. 33006--><p class="indent" >   Ignorant people are like the old woman who lit a fire to cook her rice and, when
her rice was cooked, had her meal. When she had finished her meal, she sat back and
had a cigar. It so happened that when she lit her cigar with one of the embers of
the fire, it burned her mouth. &#8217;Damned fire,&#8217; she thought. &#8217;It burned my
mouth.&#8217; So she put all her matches in a pile and poured water all over them so
that there wouldn&#8217;t be any more fire in the house &#8212; just like a fool with no
sense at all. The next day, when she wanted fire to cook her meal, there
wasn&#8217;t any left. At night, when she wanted light, she had to go pestering
her neighbors, asking this person and that, and yet still she hated fire. We
have to learn how to make use of things and to have a sense of how much is

enough. If you light only a little fire, it&#8217;ll be three hours before your rice is
cooked. The fire isn&#8217;t enough for your food. So it is with us: We see stress as
something bad and so try to remedy it &#8212; keeping at it with our eyes closed, as if
we were blind. No matter how much we treat it, we never get anywhere at
all.
<!--l. 33024--><p class="indent" >   People with discernment will see that stress is of two kinds: (1) physical stress, or
the inherent stress of natural conditions; and (2) mental stress, or the stress of
defilement. Once there&#8217;s birth, there has to be aging, illness, and death. Whoever
tries to remedy aging can keep at it till they&#8217;re withered and gray. When we try to
remedy illness, we&#8217;re usually like the old woman pouring water all over her
matches. Sometimes we treat things just right, sometimes we don&#8217;t &#8212; as
when the front step gets cracked, and we dismantle the house right up to the
roof.
<!--l. 33034--><p class="indent" >   Illness is something that everyone has, in other words, the diseases that appear in
the various parts of the body. Once we&#8217;ve treated the disease in our eyes, it&#8217;ll go
appear in our ears, nose, in front, in back, in our arm, our hand, our foot, etc., and
then it&#8217;ll sneak inside. Like a person trying to catch hold of an eel: The more you try
to catch it, the more it slips off every which way. And so we keep on treating our
diseases till we die. Some kinds of disease will go away whether we treat them or not.
If it&#8217;s a disease that goes away with treatment, then take medicine. If it&#8217;s one that
goes away whether we treat it or not, why bother? This is what it means to have
discernment.
<!--l. 33046--><p class="indent" >   Ignorant people don&#8217;t know which kinds of stress should be treated and which
kinds shouldn&#8217;t, and so they put their time and money to waste. As for intelligent
people, they see what should be treated and they treat it using their own
discernment. All diseases arise either from an imbalance in the physical
elements or from kamma. If it&#8217;s a disease that arises from the physical elements,
we should treat it with food, medicine, etc. If it arises from kamma, we
have to treat it with the Buddha&#8217;s medicine. In other words, stress and
pain that arise from the heart, if we treat them with food and medicine,
won&#8217;t respond. We have to treat them with the Dhamma. Whoever knows
how to manage this is said to have a sense of how to observe and diagnose
stress.
<!--l. 33059--><p class="indent" >   If we look at it in another way, we&#8217;ll see that aging, illness, and death are simply
the shadows of stress and not its true substance. People lacking discernment will try
to do away with the shadows, which leads only to more suffering and stress. This is
because they aren&#8217;t acquainted with what the shadows and substance of stress come
from. The essence of stress lies with the mind. Aging, illness, and death are its
shadows or effects that show by way of the body. When we want to kill
our enemy and so take a knife to stab his shadow, how is he going to die?
In the same way, ignorant people try to destroy the shadows of stress and
don&#8217;t get anywhere. As for the essence of stress in the heart, they don&#8217;t
think of remedying it at all. This ignorance of theirs is one form of avijja, or
unawareness.
<!--l. 33072--><p class="indent" >   To look at it in still another way, both the shadows and the real thing come from
tanha, craving. We&#8217;re like a person who has amassed a huge fortune and then, when

thieves come to break in, goes killing the thieves. He doesn&#8217;t see his own wrong-doing
and sees only the wrong-doing of others. Actually, once he&#8217;s piled his house full in
this way, thieves can&#8217;t help but break in. In the same way, people suffer from stress
and so they hate it, and yet they don&#8217;t make the effort to straighten themselves
out.
<!--l. 33081--><p class="indent" >   Stress comes from the three forms of craving, so we should kill off craving for
sensuality, craving for becoming, and craving for no becoming. These things are
fabricated in our own heart, and we have to know them with our own mindfulness
and discernment. Once we&#8217;ve contemplated them until we see, we&#8217;ll know: &#8217;This sort
of mental state is craving for sensuality; this sort is craving for becoming; and this
sort, craving for no becoming.&#8217;
<!--l. 33089--><p class="indent" >   People with discernment will see that these things exist in the heart in
subtle, intermediate, and blatant stages, just as a person has three stages in a
lifetime: youth, middle age, and old age. &#8217;Youth&#8217; is craving for sensuality. Once
this thirst arises in the heart, it wavers and moves &#8212; this is craving for
becoming &#8212; and then takes shape as craving for no further becoming &#8212; a
sambhavesin with its neck stretched out looking for its object, causing itself stress
and pain. In other words, we take a liking to various sights, sounds, smells,
flavors, etc., and so fix on them, which brings us stress. So we shouldn&#8217;t
preoccupy ourselves with sights, sounds, etc., that provoke greed, anger, or
delusion (craving for sensuality), causing the mind to waver and whisk out
with concepts (this is craving for becoming; when the mind sticks with its
wavering, won&#8217;t stop repeating its motions, that&#8217;s craving for no further
becoming).
<!--l. 33104--><p class="indent" >   When we gain discernment, we should destroy these forms of craving with
anulomika-ñana, knowledge in accordance with the four Noble Truths, knowing
exactly how much ease and pleasure the mind has when cravings for sensuality,
becoming, and no becoming all disappear. This is called knowing the reality of
disbanding. As for the cause of stress and the path to the disbanding of stress, we&#8217;ll
know them as well.
<!--l. 33111--><p class="indent" >   Ignorant people will go ride in the shadow of a car &#8212; and they&#8217;ll end up with
their heads bashed in. People who don&#8217;t realize what the shadows of virtue are, will
end up riding only the shadows. Words and deeds are the shadows of virtue. Actual
virtue is in the heart. The heart at normalcy is the substance of virtue. The
substance of concentration is the mind firmly centered in a single preoccupation
without any interference from concepts or mental labels. The bodily side to
concentration &#8212; when our mouth, eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are quiet &#8212; is just
the shadow, as when the body sits still, its mouth closed and not speaking
with anyone, its nose not interested in any smells, its eyes closed and not
interested in any objects, etc. If the mind is firmly centered to the level of fixed
penetration, then whether we sit, stand, walk, or lie down, the mind doesn&#8217;t
waver.
<!--l. 33126--><p class="indent" >   Once the mind is trained to the level of fixed penetration, discernment will arise
without our having to search for it, just like an imperial sword: When it&#8217;s drawn for
use, it&#8217;s sharp and flashing. When it&#8217;s no longer needed, it goes back in the scabbard.
This is why we are taught,

<!--l. 33137--><p class="indent" >   This is what it means to know stress, its cause, its disbanding, and the path to its
disbanding. This is the substance of virtue, concentration, and discernment. Whoever
can do this will reach release: nibbana. Whoever can give rise to the Dhamma of
study and practice within themselves will meet with the Dhamma of attainment
without a doubt. This is why it&#8217;s said to be sanditthiko, visible in the present;
akaliko, bearing fruit no matter what the time or season. Keep working at it

<!--l. 33147--><p class="indent" >   For the heart to go and do harm to other people, we first have to open the way
for it. In other words, we start out by doing harm to ourselves, and this
clears the way from inside the house for us to go out and do harm to people
outside.
<!--l. 33152--><p class="indent" >   The intention to do harm is a heavy form of self-harm. At the very least, it uses
up our time and destroys our opportunity to do good. We have to wipe it out with
the intention not to do harm &#8212; or in other words, with concentration. This is like
seeing that there&#8217;s plenty of unused space in our property and that we aren&#8217;t making
enough for our living. We&#8217;ll have to leap out into the open field so as to give ourself
the momentum for doing our full measure of goodness as the opportunity
arises...
<!--l. 33161--><p class="indent" >   Nekkhamma-sankappo (thoughts of renunciation), i.e., being at ease
in quiet, solitary places. Abyapada-sankappo (thoughts of non-anger): We
don&#8217;t have to think about our own bad points or the bad points of others.
Avihinsa-sankappo (thoughts of not doing harm), not creating trouble or doing harm
to ourselves, i.e., (1) not thinking about our own shortcomings, which would
depress us; (2) if we think about our own shortcomings, it&#8217;ll spread like
wildfire to the shortcomings of others. For this reason, wise people lift their
thoughts to the level of goodness so that they can feel love and good will for
themselves, and so that they can then feel love and good will for others as
well.
<!--l. 33172--><p class="indent" >   When our mind has these three forms of energy, it&#8217;s like a table with three legs
that can spin in all directions. To put it another way, once our mind has spun up to
this high a level, we can take pictures of everything above and below us. We&#8217;ll
develop discernment like a bright light or like binoculars that can magnify every
detail. This is called ñana &#8212; intuitive awareness that can know everything in the
world: Lokavidu.
<!--l. 33180--><p class="indent" >   The discernment here isn&#8217;t ordinary knowledge or insight. It&#8217;s a special cognitive
skill, the skill of the Noble Path. We&#8217;ll give rise to three eyes in the heart, so as to see
the reds and greens, the highs and lows of the mundane world: a sport for those with
wisdom. Our internal eyes will look at the Dhamma in front and behind, above and
below and all around us, so as to know all the ins and outs of goodness and evil. This
is discernment. We&#8217;ll be at our ease, feeling pleasure with no pain interfering at all.
This is called vijja-carana-sampanno &#8212; being fully equipped with cognitive
skill...

<!--l. 33190--><p class="indent" >   Whoever sees the world as having highs and lows doesn&#8217;t yet have true intuitive
discernment. Whoever has the eye of intuition will see that there are no highs, no
lows, no rich, no poor. Everything is equal in terms of the three common
characteristics: inconstant, stressful, and not-self. It&#8217;s like the equality of democracy.
Their home is the same as our home, with no differences at all. People commit
burglaries and robberies these days because they don&#8217;t see equality. They think that
this person is good, that person isn&#8217;t; this house is a good place to eat, that house
isn&#8217;t; this house is a good place to sleep, that house isn&#8217;t, etc. It&#8217;s because they
don&#8217;t have insight, the eye of discernment, that there&#8217;s all this confusion and
turmoil...
<!--l. 33202--><p class="indent" >   If we can get our practice on the Noble Path, we&#8217;ll enter nibbana. Virtue
will disband, concentration will disband, discernment will disband. In other
words, we won&#8217;t dwell on our knowledge or discernment. If we&#8217;re intelligent
enough to know, we simply know, without taking intelligence as being an
essential part of ourselves. On the lower level, we&#8217;re not stuck on virtue,
concentration, or discernment. On a higher level, we&#8217;re not stuck on the stages of
stream-entry, once-returning, or non-returning. Nibbana isn&#8217;t stuck on the world,
the world isn&#8217;t stuck on nibbana. Only at this point can we use the term
&#8217;arahant&#8217;.
<!--l. 33212--><p class="indent" >   This is where we can relax. They can say inconstant, but it&#8217;s just what they say.
They can say stress, but it&#8217;s just what they say. They can say not-self, but it&#8217;s just
what they say. Whatever they say, that&#8217;s the way it is. It&#8217;s true for them, and they&#8217;re
completely right &#8212; but completely wrong. As for us, only if we can get ourselves
beyond right and wrong will we be doing fine. Roads are built for people
to walk on, but dogs and cats can walk on them as well. Sane people and
crazy people will use the roads: They didn&#8217;t build the roads for crazy people,
but crazy people have every right to use them. As for the precepts, even
fools and idiots can observe them. The same with concentration: Crazy or
sane, they can come and sit. And discernment: We all have the right to
come and talk our heads off, but it&#8217;s simply a question of being right or
wrong.
<!--l. 33226--><p class="indent" >   None of the valuables of the mundane world give any real pleasure. They&#8217;re

have any need for them. Right views and wrong views are an affair of the world.
Nibbana doesn&#8217;t have any right views or wrong views. For this reason, whatever is a
wrong view, we should abandon. Whatever is a right view, we should develop

<!--l. 33310--><p class="indent" >   Anger. When this defilement really gets strong, it has no sense of good or evil,

right or wrong, husband, wives, or children. It can drink human blood. An example
we often see is when people get quarreling and one of them ends up in prison or even
on death row, convicted for murder. This is even worse than your house burning
down, because you have nothing left at all. For this reason, we have to get ourselves
some life insurance by observing the five or eight precepts so that we can treat
and bandage our open sores &#8212; i.e., so that we can wash away the evil and
unwise things in our thoughts, words, and deeds. Even if we can&#8217;t wash them
all away, we should try at least to relieve them somewhat. Although you
may still have some fire left, let there just be enough to cook your food
or light your home. Don&#8217;t let there be so much that it burns your house
down.
<!--l. 33324--><p class="indent" >   The only way to put out these fires is to meditate and develop thoughts of good
will. The mind won&#8217;t feel any anger, hatred, or ill will, and instead will feel nothing
but thoughts of sympathy, seeing that everyone in the world aims at goodness, but
that our goodness isn&#8217;t equal. You have to use really careful discernment to consider
cause and effect, and then be forgiving, with the thought that we human
beings aren&#8217;t equal or identical in our goodness and evil. If everyone were
equal, the world would fall apart. If we were equally good or equally bad,
the world would have to fall apart for sure. Suppose that all the people
in the world were farmers, with no merchants or government officials. Or
suppose there were only government officials, with no farmers at all: We&#8217;d all
starve to death with our mouths gaping and dry. If everyone were equal and
identical, the end of the world would come in only a few days&#8217; time. Consider
your body: Even the different parts of your own body aren&#8217;t equal. Some of
your fingers are short, some are long, some small, some large. If all ten of
your fingers were equal, you&#8217;d have a monster&#8217;s hands. So when even your
own fingers aren&#8217;t equal, how can you expect people to be equal in terms
of their thoughts, words, and deeds? You have to think this way and be
forgiving...

will and loving kindness.
<!--l. 33350--><p class="indent" >   This comes from getting life insurance: practicing tranquillity meditation so as to
chase the defilements away from the mind. Thoughts of sensual desire, ill will,
lethargy, restlessness, and uncertainty will vanish, and the mind will be firmly
centered in concentration, using its powers of directed thought to stay with
its meditation word &#8212; buddho &#8212; and its powers of evaluation to create a
sense of inner lightness and ease. When the mind fills itself with rapture &#8212;
the flavor arising from concentration &#8212; it will have its own inner food and

to the ancient hymns of the brahmans &#8212; passed down through oral transmission &amp;

included in their canon &#8212; the brahmans have come to the definite conclusion that
"Only this is true; anything else is worthless." What does Master Gotama have to say
to this?"
<!--l. 33372--><p class="indent" >   "Tell me, Bharadvaja, is there among the brahmans even one brahman who says,

Suppose there were a row of blind men, each holding on to the one in front
of him: the first one doesn&#8217;t see, the middle one doesn&#8217;t see, the last one

a row of blind men, as it were: the first one doesn&#8217;t see, the middle one
doesn&#8217;t see, the last one doesn&#8217;t see. So what do you think, Bharadvaja:

groundless?"

They also honor it as unbroken tradition."

There are five things that can turn out in two ways in the here-&amp;-now. Which five?
Conviction, liking, unbroken tradition, reasoning by analogy, &amp; an agreement through
pondering views. These are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the
here-&amp;-now. Now some things are firmly held in conviction and yet vain, empty, &amp;
false. Some things are not firmly held in conviction, and yet they are genuine, factual,

well-reasoned ... Some things are well-pondered and yet vain, empty, &amp; false. Some
things are not well-pondered, and yet they are genuine, factual, &amp; unmistaken. In

through pondering those dhammas, desire arises. With the arising of desire,

<!--l. 33528--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; AN 8.13
<!--l. 33530--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha saw that the ease and happiness of ordinary pleasures is nothing
lasting. He wanted an ease and happiness that didn&#8217;t follow the way of the
worldly pleasures that most people want. This was why he left his family and
friends, and went off to live in seclusion. He said to himself, &#8217;I came alone
when I was born and I&#8217;ll go alone when I die. No one hired me to be born
and no one will hire me to die, so I&#8217;m beholden to no one. There&#8217;s no one I
have to fear. In all of my actions, if there&#8217;s anything that is right from the
standpoint of the world, but wrong from the standpoint of the truth &#8212; and
wrong from the standpoint of my heart &#8212; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll be willing to do
it.&#8217;
<!--l. 33542--><p class="indent" >   So he posed himself a question: &#8217;Now that you&#8217;ve been born as a human being,
what is the highest thing you want in this world?&#8217; He then placed the following
conditions on his answer: &#8217;In answering, you have to be really honest and truthful
with yourself. And once you&#8217;ve answered, you have to hold to your answer as an
unalterable law on which you&#8217;ve affixed your seal, without ever letting a second seal

be affixed on top. So what do you want, and how do you want it? You have to
give an honest answer, understand? I won&#8217;t accept anything false. And once
you&#8217;ve answered, you have to keep to your answer. Don&#8217;t be a traitor to
yourself.&#8217;
<!--l. 33553--><p class="indent" >   When he was sure of his answer, he said to himself, &#8217;I want only the highest and
most certain happiness and ease: the happiness that won&#8217;t change into anything else.
Other than that, I don&#8217;t want anything else in the world.&#8217;
<!--l. 33558--><p class="indent" >   Once he had given this answer, he kept to it firmly. He didn&#8217;t allow anything that
would have caused the least bit of pain or distraction to his heart to get stuck there
as a stain on it. He kept making a persistent effort with all his might to discover the
truth, without retreat, until he finally awakened to that truth: the reality of
Liberation.
<!--l. 33564--><p class="indent" >   If we search for the truth like the Buddha &#8212; if we&#8217;re true in our intent and true
in what we do &#8212; there&#8217;s no way the truth can escape us. But if we aren&#8217;t true to
ourselves, we won&#8217;t find the true happiness the Buddha found. We tell ourselves that
we want to be happy but we go jumping into fires. We know what things are poison,
yet we go ahead and drink them anyway. This is called being a traitor to
yourself...
<!--l. 33572--><p class="indent" >   Every person alive wants happiness &#8212; even common animals struggle
to find happiness &#8212; but our actions for the most part aren&#8217;t in line with
our intentions. This is why we don&#8217;t get to realize the happiness we want,
simply because there&#8217;s no truth to us. For example, when people come to the
monastery: If they come to make offerings, observe the precepts, and sit
in meditation for the sake of praise or a good reputation, there&#8217;s no real
merit to what they&#8217;re doing. They don&#8217;t gain any real happiness from it,
so they end up disappointed and dissatisfied. Then they start saying that
offerings, precepts, and meditation don&#8217;t give any good results. Instead of
reflecting on the fact that they weren&#8217;t right and honest in doing these things,
they say that there&#8217;s no real good to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha,
that the Buddha&#8217;s teachings are a lot of nonsense and lies. But actually the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings are an affair of the truth. If a person isn&#8217;t true to the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings, the Buddha&#8217;s teachings won&#8217;t be true to that person &#8212;
and that person won&#8217;t be able to know what the Buddha&#8217;s true teachings
are...
<!--l. 33590--><p class="indent" >   When we practice virtue, concentration, and discernment, it&#8217;s as if we were taking
the jewels and robes of royalty and the Noble Ones to dress up our heart
and make it beautiful. But if we aren&#8217;t true in our practice, it&#8217;s like taking
robes and jewels and giving them to a monkey. The monkey is bound to get
them dirty and tear them to shreds because it has no sense of beauty at all.
Whoever sees this kind of thing happening is sure to see right through it, that
it&#8217;s a monkey show. Even though the costumes are genuine, the monkey
inside isn&#8217;t genuine like the costumes. For instance, if you take a soldier&#8217;s cap
and uniform to dress it up as a soldier, it&#8217;s a soldier only as far as the cap
and uniform, but the monkey inside is still a monkey and not a soldier at
all.
<!--l. 33603--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, the Buddha teaches us to be true in whatever we do &#8212; to be true

in being generous, true in being virtuous, true in developing concentration and
discernment. Don&#8217;t play around at these things. If you&#8217;re true, then these
activities are sure to bear you the fruits of your own truthfulness without a
doubt.

<!--l. 33669--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; AN 8.39
<!--l. 33671--><p class="indent" >   There are three levels of virtue &#8212;
<!--l. 33673--><p class="indent" >   1. Hetthima-sila: normalcy of word and deed, which consists of three kinds of
bodily acts &#8212; not killing, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct; and four
kinds of speech &#8212; not lying, not speaking divisively, not saying anything coarse or
abusive, not speaking idly. If we class virtue on this level according to the wording of
the precepts and the groups of people who observe them, there are four &#8212; the five
precepts, the eight, the ten, and the 227 precepts. All of these deal with aspects of
behavior that should be abandoned, termed pahana-kicca. At the same time, the
Buddha directed us to develop good manners and proper conduct in the use of the
four necessities of life &#8212; food, clothing, shelter, and medicine &#8212; so that our
conduct in terms of thought, word, and deed will be orderly and becoming.
This aspect is termed bhavana-kicca, behavior we should work at developing
correctly.
<!--l. 33688--><p class="indent" >   Observance of these precepts or rules &#8212; dealing merely with words and deeds &#8212;
forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue, which is what makes us into
full-fledged human beings (manussa-sampatti).
<!--l. 33693--><p class="indent" >   2. Majjhima-sila:the medium level of virtue, i.e., keeping watch over your
words and deeds so that they cause no harm; and, in addition, keeping watch
over your thoughts so as to keep your mental kamma upright in three ways
&#8212;
<!--l. 33698--><p class="indent" >   a. Anabhijjha-visamalobha: not coveting things that do not belong to you and
that lie beyond your scope or powers; not focusing your thoughts on such things; not
building what are called castles in the air. The Buddha taught us to tend to the
wealth we already have so that it can grow on its own. The wealth we already have, if
we use our intelligence and ingenuity, will draw more wealth our way without our
having to waste energy by being covetous or greedy. For example, suppose we
have a single banana tree: If we water it, give it fertilizer, loosen the soil
around its roots, and protect it from dangers, our single banana tree will
eventually give rise to an increase of other banana trees. In other words, if
we&#8217;re intelligent we can turn whatever wealth we have into a basis for a
livelihood. But if we lack intelligence &#8212; if our hearts simply want to get, without
wanting work &#8212; then even if we acquire a great deal of wealth, we won&#8217;t be
able to support ourselves. Thus, greed of this sort, in which we focus our
desires above and beyond our capacities, is classed as a wrong kind of mental
action.
<!--l. 33716--><p class="indent" >   b. Abyapada: abandoning thoughts of ill will, hatred, and vengeance, and
developing thoughts of good will instead; thinking of the good aspects of the people
who have angered us. When people make us angry, it comes from the fact that our
dealings with them &#8212; in which we associate with and assist one another &#8212;
sometimes lead to disappointment. This gives rise to dislike and irritation, which in

turn cause us to brood, so that we develop hurt feelings that grow into anger and
thoughts of retaliation. Thus we should regard such people from many angles, for
ordinarily as human beings they should have some good to them. If they
don&#8217;t act well toward us, they may at least speak well to us. Or if they don&#8217;t
act or speak well to us, perhaps their thoughts may be well-meaning to
at least some extent. Thus, when you find your thoughts heading in the
direction of anger or dislike, you should sit down and think in two ways
&#8212;
<!--l. 33731--><p class="indent" >   (1) Try to think of whatever ways that person has been good to you. When these
things come to mind, they&#8217;ll give rise to feelings of affection, love, and good will. This
is one way.
<!--l. 33735--><p class="indent" >   (2) Anger is something worthless, like the scum floating on the surface of a lake. If
we&#8217;re stupid, we won&#8217;t get to drink the clean water lying underneath; or if we
drink the scum, we may catch a disease. A person who is bad to you is like
someone sunk in filth. If you&#8217;re stupid enough to hate or be angry with
such people, it&#8217;s as if you wanted to go sit in the filth with them. Is that
what you want? Think about this until any thoughts of ill will and anger
disappear.
<!--l. 33743--><p class="indent" >   c. Samma-ditthi: abandoning wrong views and mental darkness. If our minds
lack the proper training and education, we may come to think that we and
all other living beings are born simply as accidents of nature; that &#8217;father&#8217;
and &#8217;mother&#8217; have no special meaning; that good and evil don&#8217;t exist. Such
views deviate from the truth. They can dissuade us from restraining the
evil that lies within us and from searching for and fostering the good. To
believe that there&#8217;s no good or evil, that death is annihilation, is Wrong
View &#8212; a product of short-sighted thinking and poor discernment, seeing
things for what they aren&#8217;t. So we should abandon such views and educate
ourselves, searching for knowledge of the Dhamma and associating with people
wiser than we, so that they can show us the bright path. We&#8217;ll then be able
to reform our views and make them Right, which is one form of mental
uprightness.
<!--l. 33758--><p class="indent" >   Virtue on this level, when we can maintain it well, will qualify us to be heavenly
beings. The qualities of heavenly beings, which grow out of human values, will turn
us into human beings who are divine in our virtues, for to guard our thoughts, words,
and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetime. This is one
aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the middle level of
virtue.
<!--l. 33765--><p class="indent" >   3. Uparima-sila: higher virtue, where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the area
of mental activity. There are two sides to higher virtue &#8212;
<!--l. 33769--><p class="indent" >   a. PAHANA-KICCA: qualities to be abandoned, which are of five sorts
&#8212;
<!--l. 33772--><p class="indent" >   (1) Kamachanda: affection, desire, laxity, infatuation.(2) Byapada: ill
will and hatred.(3) Thina-middha: discouragement, drowsiness, sloth.(4)
Uddhacca-kukkucca: restlessness and anxiety.(5) Vicikiccha: doubt, uncertainty,
indecision.
<!--l. 33777--><p class="indent" >   DISCUSSION

<!--l. 33779--><p class="indent" >   (1) Ill will (byapada) lies at the essence of killing (panatipata), for it causes us to
destroy our own goodness and that of others &#8212; and when our mind can kill off our
own goodness, what&#8217;s to keep us from killing other people and animals as
well?
<!--l. 33784--><p class="indent" >   (2) Restlessness (uddhacca) lies at the essence of taking what isn&#8217;t given
(adinnadana). The mind wanders about, taking hold of other people&#8217;s affairs,
sometimes their good points, sometimes their bad. To fasten onto their good points
isn&#8217;t too serious, for it can give us at least some nourishment. As long as we&#8217;re going
to steal other people&#8217;s business and make it our own, we might as well take their
silver and gold. Their bad points, though, are like trash they&#8217;ve thrown away &#8212;
scraps and bones with nothing of any substance &#8212; and yet even so we let
the mind feed on them. When we know that other people are possessive of
their bad points and guard them well and yet we still take hold of these
things to think about, it should be classed as a form of taking what isn&#8217;t
given.
<!--l. 33797--><p class="indent" >   (3) Sensual desires (kamachanda) lie at the essence of sensual misconduct. The
mind feels an attraction for sensual objects &#8212; thoughts of past or future sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations &#8212; or for sensual defilements &#8212; passion,
aversion, or delusion &#8212; to the point where we forget ourselves. Mental states
such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety in sensual
matters.
<!--l. 33805--><p class="indent" >   (4) Doubt (vicikiccha) lies at the essence of lying. In other words, our
minds are unsure, with nothing reliable or true to them. We have no firm

<!--l. 33819--><p class="indent" >   (1) Mindfulness (sati): Start out by directing your thoughts to an object, such as
your in-and-out breathing. Use mindfulness to steady the mind in its object
throughout both the in-breath and the out-. Vitakka, thinking in this way, is what
kills off sensual desires, in that the discipline of mindfulness keeps the mind from
slipping off into external objects.
<!--l. 33826--><p class="indent" >   (2) Vicara: Evaluate and be observant. Make yourself aware of whether or not
you&#8217;ve received a sense of comfort and relaxation from your in- and out-breathing. If
not, tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of ways: e.g., in long and out long,
in long and out short, in short and out short, in short and out long, in slow and out
slow, in fast and out fast, in gently and out gently, in strong and out strong, in
throughout the body and out throughout the body. Adjust the breath until it gives
good results to both body and mind, and you&#8217;ll be able to kill off feelings of ill will
and hatred.
<!--l. 33836--><p class="indent" >   (3) Piti: When you get good results &#8212; for instance, when the subtle breath
sensations in the body merge and flow together, permeating the entire sense of the

body &#8212; the breath is like an electric wire; the various parts of the body, such as
the bones, are like electricity poles; mindfulness and alertness are like a
power source; and awareness is thus bright and radiant. Both body and mind
feel satisfied and full. This is piti, or rapture, which can kill off feelings of
drowsiness.
<!--l. 33845--><p class="indent" >   (4) Sukha: Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared, a sense
of pleasure and ease arises for both body and mind. This pleasure is what kills off
restlessness.
<!--l. 33849--><p class="indent" >   (5) Ekaggata: Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distance. The mind reaches
singleness of preoccupation in a state of normalcy and equilibrium. This normalcy of
mind, which is maintained through the power of the discipline of mindfulness
(sati-vinaya), forms the essence of virtue: firmness, steadiness, stability. And the
resulting flavor or nourishment of virtue is a solitary sense of calm for the mind.
When freedom of this sort arises within us, this is called the development of
silanussati, the mindfulness of virtue. This is virtue that attains excellence &#8212; leading
to the paths, their fruitions, and nibbana &#8212; and thus can be called uparima-sila,
higher virtue.
<!--l. 33860--><p class="indent" >   To summarize, there are three levels of virtue: external, intermediate, and
internal. In ultimate terms, however, there are two &#8212;
<!--l. 33863--><p class="indent" >   1. Mundane virtue: virtue connected with the world, in which we maintain the
principles of ordinary human morality but are as yet unable to reach the
transcendent levels: stream entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship.
We can&#8217;t yet cut the Fetters (sanyojana) that tie the heart to the influences of all the
worlds. This is thus called mundane virtue. 2. Transcendent virtue: virtue
that&#8217;s constant and sure, going straight to the heart, bathing the heart with
its nourishment. This arises from the practice of tranquillity meditation
and insight meditation. tranquillity meditation forms the cause, and insight
meditation the result: discovering the true nature of the properties, aggregates
(khandhas), and senses; seeing clearly the four Noble Truths, in proportion
to our practice of the Path, and abandoning the first three of the Fetters
&#8212;
<!--l. 33877--><p class="indent" >   a. Sakkaya-ditthi (self-identity views): views that see the body or the aggregates
as in the self or as belonging to the self. Ordinarily, we may be convinced that views
of this sort are mistaken, yet we can&#8217;t really abandon them. But when we clearly see
that they&#8217;re wrong for sure, this is called Right View &#8212; seeing things as they truly
are &#8212; which can eliminate such wrong views as seeing the body as belonging
to the self, or the self as the five aggregates, or the five aggregates as in
the self. b. Vicikiccha: doubt about what&#8217;s genuine and true, and what&#8217;s
counterfeit and false. The power of Right View allows us to see that the quality to
which we awaken exists at all times and that the true qualities enabling
us to awaken also exist and are made effective through the power of the
practices we&#8217;re following. Our knowledge is definite and true. Our doubts
about the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha are cleared up for
good. This is called becoming a niyata-puggala, a person who is certain and
sure.
<!--l. 33894--><p class="indent" >   c. Silabbata-paramasa: When the heart abandons this Fetter, it no longer fondles

theories concerning moral virtue; it&#8217;s no longer stuck merely on the level of manners
and activities. Good and evil are accomplished through the heart; activities are
something separate. Even though people who reach this level do good &#8212; taking the
precepts, making gifts and offerings, or meditating in line with the good customs of
the world &#8212; they&#8217;re not caught up on any of these things, because their hearts have
reached the nourishment of virtue. They aren&#8217;t stuck on the particulars
(byañjana), i.e., their activities; nor are they stuck on the purpose (attha), i.e., the
meaning or intent of their various good manners. Their hearts dwell in the
nourishment of virtue: tranquillity, stability, normalcy of mind. Just as a
person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating his
body isn&#8217;t stuck on either the food or its flavor &#8212; because he&#8217;s received
the benefits of the nourishment it provides &#8212; in the same way, the hearts
of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on
activities or manners, particulars or purposes, because they&#8217;ve tasted virtue&#8217;s
nourishment.
<!--l. 33913--><p class="indent" >   This is thus classed as transcendent virtue, the first stage of nibbana. Even
though such people may be destined for further rebirth, they&#8217;re special people, apart
from the ordinary. Anyone whose practice reaches this level can be counted as
fortunate, as having received dependable wealth, like ingots of gold. Just as gold can
be used as currency all over the world because it has special value for all human
beings &#8212; unlike paper currency, whose use is limited to specific countries &#8212; in
the same way, a heart that has truly attained virtue has a value in this life
that will remain constant in lives to come. Thus, a person who has reached
this level has received part of the Noble Wealth of those who practice the
religion.

<!--l. 34055--><p class="indent" >   Inner wealth, according to the texts, means seven things &#8212; conviction, virtue, a
sense of conscience, scrupulousness, breadth of learning, generosity, and discernment
&#8212; but to put it simply, inner wealth refers to the inner quality we build within
ourselves. Outer wealth &#8212; money and material goods &#8212; doesn&#8217;t have any hard and
fast owners. Today it may be ours, tomorrow someone else may take it away. There
are times when it belongs to us, and times when it belongs to others. Even with
things that are fixed in the ground, like farms or orchards, you can&#8217;t keep them from
changing hands.
<!--l. 34066--><p class="indent" >   So when you develop yourself so as to gain the discernment that sees how
worldly things are undependable and unsure, don&#8217;t let your property &#8212; your
worldly possessions &#8212; sit idle. The Buddha teaches us to plant crops on our
land so that we can benefit from it. If you don&#8217;t make use of your land, it&#8217;s
sure to fall into other people&#8217;s hands. In other words, when we stake out a
claim to a piece of property, we should plant it full of crops. Otherwise the
government won&#8217;t recognize our claim, and we&#8217;ll lose our rights to it. Even if we
take the case to court, we won&#8217;t have a chance to win. So once you see the
weakness of an idle claim, you should hurry up and plant crops on it so
that the government will recognize your claim and issue you a title to the
land.
<!--l. 34079--><p class="indent" >   What this means is that we should make use of our material possessions by being
generous with them, using them in a way that develops the inner wealth of generosity
within us. This way they become the kind of wealth over which we have full rights,
and that will benefit us even into future lifetimes.
<!--l. 34085--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Ajaan Lee, Trading Outer Wealth for Inner Wealth
<!--l. 34087--><p class="indent" >   One of the important reasons why the Buddha taught the Dhamma was to teach
us to let go, not to hold on to things. The more we really know the Dhamma, the
more we can let go. Those who know a little can let go of a little; those who know a

lot can let go of a lot.
<!--l. 34092--><p class="indent" >   As a first step we&#8217;re taught dana &#8212; to be generous, to give donations &#8212; as a
strategy for getting us to learn how to let go. The next step is caga &#8212; renouncing
rights of possession &#8212; which is letting go at a higher level than dana. And finally,
on a more refined level, we&#8217;re taught to relinquish all our upadhi, or the
acquisition-defilements in the mind. This is the level on which we examine and
explore until we can gain total release.
<!--l. 34101--><p class="indent" >   Dana means giving away material things. If we don&#8217;t give them away, they&#8217;re hard
to let go. For the most part, if we don&#8217;t give things away, we hold rights over them
and regard them as belonging to us. But if we give them away, we no longer have any
rights over them. Things we hold onto are dangerous. (1) They can cause us harm.
(2) They cause harm to people who steal them from us. And (3) once those people
have stolen them, then they claim rights over them. The Buddha saw these
dangers, which is why he taught us to be generous, to learn how to give things
away.
<!--l. 34111--><p class="indent" >   People who develop the habit of being generous reap many rewards. Their act of
generosity comes back to them both in the present and on into the future. They have
lots of friends. Other people trust them. Their hearts are light &#8212; they aren&#8217;t weighed
down with worries about looking after the things they&#8217;ve given away. And these
same results will keep coming in the future, just as when we have a bucket
of rice grains: if we plant them in a field, we&#8217;ll reap ten buckets of rice in
return. The same holds true with the goodness we develop in this lifetime.
It gives enormous returns. That&#8217;s how people of discernment understand
it.
<!--l. 34122--><p class="indent" >   Caga is the next step. Dana is something that even crazy people can do, but caga
is a type of giving that only wise people can do, because their sense of personal
possession has to end immediately in the act of giving. They see that all material
things are common property: things don&#8217;t really belong to us, they don&#8217;t really
belong to other people. If you see things as belonging to you, that&#8217;s addiction to
sensuality (kamasukhallikanuyoga). If you see things as belonging to others, that&#8217;s
addiction to self-affliction (attakilamathanuyoga). When we&#8217;re born, we
didn&#8217;t bring anything along with us when we came. When we die, we won&#8217;t
take anything along when we go. So what really belongs to us? Our sense
of possession has to fall away from the heart if our giving is to count as
caga.
<!--l. 34135--><p class="indent" >   The third level of letting go is relinquishing what&#8217;s in the heart. Whether or not
we give things away, we let go of them in the heart every day. We let go of the things
we have. We let go of the things we don&#8217;t have. Just as a person has to wash his
mouth and hands every day after he eats if he wants to stay clean at all times.
What this means is that we&#8217;re not willing to let anything act as an enemy
to the heart by making us stingy or grasping. If we don&#8217;t do this, we&#8217;re
the type of person who doesn&#8217;t wash up after a meal. We&#8217;re not clean. We
stay asleep without ever waking up. But when we let go in this way, it&#8217;s
called viraga-dhamma, or dispassion. The lower levels of letting go are things
we can do only from time to time. Dispassion is something we can develop
always.

<!--l. 35065--><p class="indent" >   The important factors for anyone practicing to gain release from all stress and
suffering are persistence and endurance, for every kind of goodness has to have
obstacles blocking the way, always ready to destroy it. Even when the Buddha
himself was putting his effort into the practice, the armies of Mara were right on his
heels, pestering him all the time, trying to keep him from attaining his goal. Still, he
never wavered, never got discouraged, never abandoned his efforts. He took his
perfection of truthfulness and used it to drive away the forces of Mara until they were
utterly defeated. He was willing to put his life on the line in order to do
battle with the forces of Mara, his heart solid, unflinching, and brave. This
was why he was eventually able to attain a glorious victory, realizing the
unexcelled right self-awakening, becoming our Buddha. This is an important
example that he as our "father" set for his descendants to see and to take to
heart.
<!--l. 35081--><p class="indent" >   So when we&#8217;re intent on training our minds to be good, there are bound to be
obstacles &#8212; the forces of Mara &#8212; just as in the case of the Buddha, but we simply
have to slash our way through them, using our powers of endurance and the

full extent of our abilities to fight them off. It&#8217;s only normal that when we
have something good, there are going to be other people who want what
we&#8217;ve got, in the same way that sweet fruit tends to have worms and insects
trying to eat it. A person walking along the road empty-handed doesn&#8217;t
attract anyone&#8217;s attention, but if we&#8217;re carrying something of value, there
are sure to be others who will want what we&#8217;ve got, and will even try to
steal it from us. If we&#8217;re carrying food in our hand, dogs or cats will try to
snatch it. But if we don&#8217;t have any food in our hand, they won&#8217;t pounce on
us.
<!--l. 35095--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s the same way when we practice. When we do good, we have to contend
with obstacles if we want to succeed. We have to make our hearts hard and
solid like diamond or rock, which don&#8217;t burn when you try to set them on
fire. Even when they get smashed, the pieces maintain their hardness as
diamond and rock. The Buddha made his heart so hard and solid that when
his body was cremated, parts of it didn&#8217;t burn and still remain as relics
for us to admire even today. This was through the power of his purity and
truthfulness.
<!--l. 35104--><p class="indent" >   So we should set our minds on purifying our bodies and minds until they become
so truly elemental that fire won&#8217;t burn them, just like the Buddha&#8217;s relics. Even if we
can&#8217;t get them to be that hard, at least we should make them like tamarind seeds in
their casing: even if insects bore through the casing and eat all the flesh of the
tamarind fruit, they can&#8217;t do anything to the seeds, which maintain their hardness as
always.

<!--l. 35167--><p class="indent" >   To purify the heart, we have to disentangle our attachments to self, to the body,
to mental phenomena, and to all the objects that come passing in through the senses.
Keep the mind intent on concentration. Keep it one at all times. Don&#8217;t let it become
two, three, four, five, etc., because once you&#8217;ve made the mind one, it&#8217;s easy to
make it zero. Simply cut off the little &#8217;head&#8217; and pull the two ends together.
But if you let the mind become many, it&#8217;s a long, difficult job to make it
zero.
<!--l. 35176--><p class="indent" >   And another thing: If you put the zero after other numbers, they become ten,
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, hundreds, thousands, on to infinity. But if you put the
zero&#8217;s first, even if you have ten thousand of them, they don&#8217;t count. So it is with the
heart: Once we&#8217;ve turned it from one to zero and put the zero first, then other people
can praise or criticize us as they like but it won&#8217;t count. Good doesn&#8217;t count, bad
doesn&#8217;t count. This is something that can&#8217;t be written, can&#8217;t be read, that we can
understand only for ourselves.

Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park. Now at that time Mahanama... went to
the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was
sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "I have heard that many monks are at work
making robes for the Blessed One, [thinking], &#8217;When the robes are finished, at the
end of the three months, the Blessed One will set out wandering.&#8217; For those of us

living by means of various dwelling places [for the mind], by means of which dwelling
place should we live?"
<!--l. 35284--><p class="indent" >   "Excellent, Mahanama, excellent! It is fitting for clansmen like you to

<!--l. 35431--><p class="indent" >   I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the
Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migara&#8217;s mother. Now at that time &#8212; it being the
Uposatha day &#8212; Visakha, Migara&#8217;s mother, went to the Blessed One in the middle of
the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was
sitting there the Blessed One said to her, "Well now, Visakha, why are you coming in
the middle of the day?"
<!--l. 35439--><p class="indent" >   "Today I&#8217;m observing the Uposatha, lord."
<!--l. 35441--><p class="indent" >   "Visakha, there are these three Uposathas. Which three? The Uposatha
of a cowherd, the Uposatha of the Jains, and the Uposatha of the Noble
Ones.
<!--l. 35445--><p class="indent" >   "And what is the Uposatha of a cowherd? Just as when a cowherd returns the
cattle to their owners in the evening, he reflects: &#8217;Today the cattle wandered to that
spot and this; they drank at this spot and that; tomorrow they will wander to that
spot and this; they will drink at this spot and that&#8217;; in the same way, there is the
case where a certain person observing the Uposatha reflects, &#8217;Today I ate this
sort of non-staple food and that sort of staple food. Tomorrow I will eat
that sort of non-staple food and this sort of staple food.&#8217; He spends the day

with an awareness imbued with that covetousness, with that greed. Such is
the Uposatha of a cowherd, Visakha. When this Uposatha of a cowherd is
undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or
radiance.
<!--l. 35458--><p class="indent" >   "And what is the Uposatha of the Jains? There are the contemplatives called the
Niganthas (Jains). They get their disciple to undertake the following practice: &#8217;Here,
my good man. Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than 100
leagues to the east... more than 100 leagues to the west... more than 100
leagues to the north... more than 100 leagues to the south.&#8217; Thus they get
the disciple to undertake kindness &amp; sympathy to some beings, but not to
others.
<!--l. 35467--><p class="indent" >   "On the Uposatha day, they get their disciple to undertake the following practice:
&#8217;Here, my good man. Having stripped off all your clothing, say this: "I am
nothing by anything or of anything. Thus there is nothing by anything or of
anything that is mine."&#8217; Yet in spite of that, his parents know of him that
&#8217;This is our child.&#8217; And he knows of them that &#8217;These are my parents.&#8217; His
wives &amp; children know of him that &#8217;This is our husband &amp; father.&#8217; And he
knows of them that &#8217;These are my wives &amp; children.&#8217; His workers &amp; slaves
know of him that &#8217;This is our master.&#8217; And he knows of them that &#8217;These
are my workers &amp; slaves.&#8217; Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to
undertake truthfulness, he is persuaded to undertake falsehood. At the end
of the night, he resumes the consumption of his belongings, even though
they aren&#8217;t given back to him. This counts as stealing, I tell you. Such is
the Uposatha of the Jains, Visakha. When this Uposatha of the Jains is
undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or
radiance.

There is the case of the person who has abandoned passion, desire, fondness, thirst,

thirst, fever, and craving for the body... who has done what is good, what is skillful,
has given protection to those in fear, and has not done what is evil, savage, or cruel...
who has no doubt or perplexity, who has arrived at certainty with regard to the
True Dhamma. When he comes down with a serious disease... he does not
grieve, is not tormented, does not weep or beat his breast or grow delirious.

<!--l. 36662--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 36664--><p class="indent" >   This anthology, drawn from the teachings of Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo,
provides an introduction to the basic outlines of his thought and the method of
meditation he taught.
<!--l. 36668--><p class="indent" >   The first excerpt, from The Craft of the Heart, was written shortly after he had
received training from Phra Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto. In it, Ajaan Lee shows how he
regarded the state of meditation practice in Thailand at the time, and gives
some ideas of why he himself had chosen the path of becoming a meditating
monk.
<!--l. 36674--><p class="indent" >   The passage from Keeping the Breath in Mind details the method of meditation
he developed and taught in the later years of his life. The passage from The Path to
Peace and Freedom for the Mind elaborates on a theme he had learned from Ajaan

Mun: that there are no sharp boundaries among the practice of virtue, concentration,
and discernment, and that all three of these aspects of the path are mutually
reinforcing.
<!--l. 36681--><p class="indent" >   The three excerpts from Dhamma talks make a similar point: that there is no
sharp division between the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight meditation.
They also emphasize the role played by experimenting and using one&#8217;s powers of
observation in developing meditation as a skill.
<!--l. 36687--><p class="indent" >   The excerpts from Frames of Reference and Basic Themes deal with the
development of discernment, particularly with regard to detecting the currents
of the mind &#8212; both those that flow out and get involved with the world,
and those that spin around with reference to the mind in the present &#8212; so
as to touch the aspect of the mind that doesn&#8217;t flow, even to the present
moment.
<!--l. 36694--><p class="indent" >   The next excerpt, from the concluding section of The Craft of the Heart, discusses
the goal of the practice as a supreme awareness, beyond all suppositions.
<!--l. 36698--><p class="indent" >   The final excerpt, from Ajaan Lee&#8217;s Autobiography, discusses some of the lessons
he learned by living in the forest.
<!--l. 36701--><p class="indent" >   My hope is that this anthology will inspire the reader to further explore Ajaan
Lee&#8217;s teachings &#8212; both through reading more of his writings and through putting
their teachings into practice.
<!--l. 36705--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Thanissaro Bhikkhu
<!--l. 36707--><p class="indent" >   From Craft of the Heart
<!--l. 36709--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 36711--><p class="indent" >   When I first became aware of the conflicting views held by people who
practice &#8212; and of how ill-informed they are &#8212; I felt inspired by their desire
to learn the truth, but at the same time dismayed over their views: right
mixed with wrong, some people saying that nibbana and the paths leading
to it still exist, others maintaining that nibbana has passed away and can
no longer be attained. This latter belief is a particular cause for dismay,
because a desire for nibbana is what has led us all to submit ourselves to
the practice of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings in the first place. If we don&#8217;t have
such a desire, we aren&#8217;t likely to be especially sincere in our practice; and
if we aren&#8217;t sincere, our practice will be in vain as far as the benefits the
Buddha intended for us are concerned, because the Buddha&#8217;s sole purpose in
teaching was to liberate living beings from suffering and stress. If we were
to worm our way in as parasites on his religion, it would run counter to
his compassionate intentions toward us. Each and every one of us aims for
what is good, so we should pay heed to whatever factors may lead to release
from suffering and stress. Don&#8217;t let the Buddha&#8217;s teaching pass by you in
vain.
<!--l. 36730--><p class="indent" >   By and large, from what I&#8217;ve seen of people who practice, a great many
of them train themselves in ways that mix right with wrong, and then set
themselves up as teachers, instructing their pupils in line with their various
theories about jhana, concentration, nibbana, and the stream leading to
it. The lowest level are those who get so caught up with their own views
and opinions that their teachings can become detrimental &#8212; saying, for

example, that we don&#8217;t have enough merit to practice, that we&#8217;ve been born too
late for nibbana and the paths leading to it, and so have to give up our
practice. (Opinions of this sort run the gamut from crude to middling to
subtle.)
<!--l. 36741--><p class="indent" >   But no matter what level a person may know, if he doesn&#8217;t know the hearts and
minds of others, he&#8217;ll have great difficulty in making his teachings effective and
beneficial. Even though he may have good intentions, if he lacks knowledge of those
he is teaching, progress will be difficult. The Buddha, whenever he taught, knew the
capabilities and dispositions of his listeners, and the level of teaching for which they
were ripe. He then tailored his teachings to suit their condition, which was why
he was able to get good results. Even though he had a lot of seed to sow,
he planted it only where he knew it would sprout. If he saw that the soil
was barren or the climate harsh, he wouldn&#8217;t plant any seed at all. But as
for us, we have only a fistful of rice and yet we cast it along a mountain
spine or in the belly of the sea, and so get either meager results or none at
all.
<!--l. 36755--><p class="indent" >   Thus in this book I have included teachings on every level &#8212; elementary,
intermediate, and advanced &#8212; leaving it up to the reader to pick out the teachings
intended for his or her own level of attainment.
<!--l. 36760--><p class="indent" >   In practicing meditation, if you direct your mind along the right path, you&#8217;ll see
results in the immediate present. At the same time, if you lead yourself astray, you&#8217;ll
reap harm in the immediate present as well. For the most part, if meditators lack the
training that comes from associating with those who are truly expert and
experienced, they can become deluded or schizoid in a variety of ways. How so? By
letting themselves get carried away with the signs or visions that appear to them,
to the point where they lose sense of their own bodies and minds. Playing
around with an external kasina is a special culprit in this regard. Those who
lack sufficient training will tend to hallucinate, convinced of the truth of
whatever they focus on, letting themselves get carried away by what they know
and see until they lose touch with reality, making it difficult for any sort of
discernment to arise. For this reason, in this guide I have taught to focus
exclusively on the body and mind, the important point being not to fasten
on or become obsessed with whatever may appear in the course of your
practice.
<!--l. 36777--><p class="indent" >   There are a wide variety of meditation teachers who deviate from the basic
principles taught by the Buddha. Some of them, hoping for gain, status, or praise, set
up their own creeds with magical formulae and strict observances, teaching their
students to invoke the aid of the Buddha. (Our Lord Buddha isn&#8217;t a god of any sort
who is going to come to our aid. Rather, we have to develop ourselves so as to reach
his level.) Some teachers invoke the five forms of rapture, or else visions of this or
that color or shape. If you see such and such vision, you attain the first
level of the path, and so on until you attain the second, third, and fourth
levels, and then once a year you present your teacher with offerings of rice,
fruit, and a pig&#8217;s head. (The Buddha&#8217;s purpose in spreading his teachings
was not that we would propitiate him with offerings. He was beyond the
sway of material objects of any sort whatsoever.) Once the pupils of such

teachers come to the end of their observances, they run out of levels to attain,
and so can assume themselves to be Buddhas, Private Buddhas or Noble
Disciples, and thus they become instant arahants. Their ears prick up, their hair
stands on end, and they get excited all out of proportion to any basis in
reality.
<!--l. 36797--><p class="indent" >   When you study with some teachers, you have to start out with an offering of five
candles and incense sticks, or maybe ten, plus so-and-so many flowers and so-and-so
much puffed rice, on this or that day of the week, at this or that time of day,
depending on the teacher&#8217;s preferences. (If you can afford it, there&#8217;s nothing really
wrong with this, but it means that poor people or people with little free time will
have trouble getting to learn how to meditate.) Once you finish the ceremony, the
teacher tells you to meditate araham, araham, or buddho, buddho, until
you get the vision he teaches you to look for &#8212; such as white, blue, red,
yellow, a corpse, water, fire, a person, the Buddha, a Noble Disciple, heaven,
hell &#8212; and then you start making assumptions that follow the drift of the
objects you see. You jump to the conclusion that you&#8217;ve seen something
special or have attained nibbana. Sometimes the mind gathers to the point
where you sit still, in a daze, with no sense of self-awareness at all. Or else
pleasure arises and you become attached to the pleasure, or stillness arises and
you become attached to the stillness, or a vision or a color arises and you
become attached to that. (All of these things are nothing more than uggaha
nimitta.)
<!--l. 36817--><p class="indent" >   Perhaps a thought arises and you think that it&#8217;s insight, and then you really get
carried away. You may decide that you&#8217;re a stream-winner, a once-returner, or an
arahant, and no one in the world can match you. You latch onto your views as
correct in every way, giving rise to pride and conceit. (All of the things mentioned
here, if you get attached to them, are wrong.) When this happens, liberating insight
won&#8217;t have a chance to arise.
<!--l. 36825--><p class="indent" >   So you have to keep digging away for decades &#8212; and then get fixated on the fact
that you&#8217;ve been practicing a full twenty years, and so won&#8217;t stand for it if anyone
comes along and thinks he&#8217;s better than you. So, out of fear that others will look
down on you, you become even more stubborn and proud, and that&#8217;s as far as your
knowledge and ingenuity will get you.
<!--l. 36832--><p class="indent" >   When it comes to actual attainment, some people of this sort haven&#8217;t even
brought the Triple Gem into their hearts. Of course, there are probably many people
who know better than this. I don&#8217;t mean to cast aspersions on those who
know.
<!--l. 36837--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, I have drawn up this book in line with what I have studied and
practiced, If you see that this might be the path you are looking for, give it a good
look. My teacher didn&#8217;t teach like the examples mentioned above. He taught in line
with what was readily available, without requiring that you had to offer
five incense sticks or ten candles or a pig&#8217;s head or puffed rice or flowers or
whatever. All he asked was that you have conviction in the Buddha and a
willingness to practice his teachings. If you wanted to make an offering,
some candles and incense as an offering to the Triple Gem would do &#8212; one
candle if you had one, two if you had two; if you didn&#8217;t have any, you could

dedicate your life instead. Then he would have you repeat the formula for
taking refuge in the Triple Gem as in the method given in this book. His
approach to teaching in this way has always struck me as conducive to the
practice.
<!--l. 36852--><p class="indent" >   I have been practicing for a number of years now, and what I have observed all
along has led me to have a sense of pity, both for myself and for my fellow human
beings. If we practice along the right lines, we may very likely attain the benefits we
hope for quickly. We&#8217;ll gain knowledge that will make us marvel at the good that
comes from the practice of meditation, or we may even see the paths and fruitions
leading to nibbana in this present life &#8212; because nibbana is always present. It lacks
only the people who will uncover it within themselves. Some people don&#8217;t know
how; others know, but aren&#8217;t interested &#8212; and have mistaken assumptions
about it to boot: thinking, for example, that nibbana is extinct, doesn&#8217;t
exist, can&#8217;t be attained, is beyond the powers of people in the present day;
saying that since we aren&#8217;t Noble Disciples, how could we possibly attain
it. This last is especially deluded. If we were already good, already Noble
Disciples, what purpose would we have in going around trying to attain
nibbana?
<!--l. 36868--><p class="indent" >   If we don&#8217;t despise the Buddha&#8217;s teachings, then we can all practice them. But
the truth of the matter is that though we worship the Dhamma, we don&#8217;t practice
the Dhamma, which is the same as despising it. If we feel well-enough situated in the
present, we may tell ourselves that we can wait to practice the Dhamma in
our next lifetime, or at least anytime by right now. Or we may take our
defilements as an excuse, saying that we&#8217;ll have to abandon greed, anger,
and delusion before we can practice the Buddha&#8217;s teachings. Or else we
take our work as an excuse, saying that we&#8217;ll have to stop working first.
Actually, there&#8217;s no reason that meditation should get in the way of our work,
because it&#8217;s strictly an activity of the heart. There&#8217;s no need to dismantle
our homes or abandon our belongings before practicing it; and if we did
throw away our belongings in this way, it would probably end up causing
harm.
<!--l. 36883--><p class="indent" >   Even though it&#8217;s true that we love ourselves, yet if we don&#8217;t work for our own
benefit, if we vacillate and hesitate, loading ourselves down with ballast and bricks,
we make our days and nights go to waste. So we should develop and perfect the
factors that bring about the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana. If you&#8217;re
interested, then examine the procedures explained in the following sections. Pick out
whichever section seems to correspond to your own level and abilities, and take that
as your guide.
<!--l. 36892--><p class="indent" >   As for myself, I was first attracted to the Buddha&#8217;s teachings by his statement
that to lay claim to physical and mental phenomena as our own is suffering. After
considering his teaching that the body is anatta &#8212; not-self &#8212; I began to be struck
by a sense of dismay over the nature of the body. I examined it to see in
what way it was not-self, and &#8212; as far as my understanding allowed &#8212; the
Buddha&#8217;s teaching began to make very clear sense to me. I considered how the
body arises, is sustained and passes away, and I came to the conclusion
that:

<!--l. 36902--><p class="indent" >   (1) it arises from upadana &#8212; clinging through mistaken assumptions &#8212; which
forms the essence of kamma.
<!--l. 36905--><p class="indent" >   (2) It is sustained by nourishment provided by our parents; and since our parents
have nothing of their own with which to nourish us, they have to search
for food &#8212; two-footed animals, four-footed animals, animals in the water,
and animals on land &#8212; either buying this food or else killing it on their
own and then feeding it to us. The animals abused in this way are bound
to curse and seek revenge against those who kill and eat them, just as we
are possessive of our belongings and seek revenge against those who rob
us.
<!--l. 36914--><p class="indent" >   Those who don&#8217;t know the truth of the body take it to be the self, but after
considering the diseases we suffer in our eyes, nose, mouth, and throughout the
various parts of the body, I concluded that we&#8217;ve probably been cursed by the
animals we&#8217;ve eaten, because all of these parts come from the food we&#8217;ve made
of their bodies. And so our body, cursed in this way, suffers pain with no
recourse for begging mercy. Thus, victim to the spirits of these animals, we
suffer pains in the eyes, pains in the ears, pains in the nose and mouth and
throughout the body, until in the end we have to relinquish the whole thing so
they can eat it all up. Even while we&#8217;re still living, some of them &#8212; like
mosquitoes and sandflies &#8212; come and try to take it by force. If we don&#8217;t let go
of our attachments to the body, we&#8217;re bound to suffer for many lives to
come. This is one reason why I felt attracted to the Buddha&#8217;s teachings on
not-self.
<!--l. 36929--><p class="indent" >   (3) The body passes away from being denied nourishment. The fact that this
happens to us is without a doubt a result of our past actions. We&#8217;ve probably been
harsh with other living beings, denying them food to the point where they&#8217;ve had to
part with the bodies they feel such affection for. When the results of such
actions bear fruit, our bodies will have to break up and disband in the same
way.
<!--l. 36936--><p class="indent" >   Considering things in this manner caused me to feel even more attracted to the
practical methods recommended by the Buddha for seeing not-self and letting
go of our clinging assumptions so that we no longer have to be possessive
of the treasures claimed by ignorant and fixated animals. If we persist in
holding onto the body as our own, it&#8217;s the same as cheating others of their
belongings, turning them into our own flesh and blood and then, forgetting where
these things came from, latching onto them as our very own. When this
happens, we&#8217;re like a child who, born in one family and then taken and raised
in another family with a different language, is sure to forget his original
language and family name. If someone comes along and calls him by his
original name, he most likely won&#8217;t stand for it, because of his ignorance of his
own origins. So it is with the body: Once it has grown, we latch onto it,
assuming it to be the self. We forget its origins and so become drugged,
addicted to physical and mental phenomena, enduring pain for countless
lifetimes.
<!--l. 36953--><p class="indent" >   These thoughts are what led me to start practicing the teachings of the Buddha
so as to liberate myself from this mass of suffering and stress.

<!--l. 36957--><p class="indent" >   From Keeping the Breath in Mind: Method 2
<!--l. 36959--><p class="indent" >   There are seven basic steps:
<!--l. 36961--><p class="indent" >   1. Start out with three or seven long in-and-out breaths, thinking bud- with the
in-breath, and dho with the out. Keep the meditation syllable as long as the
breath.
<!--l. 36965--><p class="indent" >   2. Be clearly aware of each in-and-out breath.
<!--l. 36967--><p class="indent" >   3. Observe the breath as it goes in and out, noticing whether it&#8217;s comfortable or
uncomfortable, broad or narrow, obstructed or free-flowing, fast or slow, short or
long, warm or cool. If the breath doesn&#8217;t feel comfortable, change it until it does. For
instance, if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable, try breathing in short
and out short.
<!--l. 36974--><p class="indent" >   As soon as you find that your breathing feels comfortable, let this comfortable
breath sensation spread to the different parts of the body. To begin with, inhale the
breath sensation at the base of the skull, and let it flow all the way down the spine.
Then, if you are male, let it spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot, to the
ends of your toes, and out into the air. Inhale the breath sensation at the
base of the skull again and let it spread down your spine, down your left
leg to the ends of your toes and out into the air. (If you are female, begin
with the left side first, because the male and female nervous systems are
different.)
<!--l. 36985--><p class="indent" >   Then let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both shoulders,
past your elbows and wrists, to the tips of your fingers and out into the
air.
<!--l. 36989--><p class="indent" >   Let the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central nerve at the
front of the body, past the lungs and liver, all the way down to the bladder and
colon.
<!--l. 36993--><p class="indent" >   Inhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the way down
to your intestines.
<!--l. 36996--><p class="indent" >   Let all these breath sensations spread so that they connect and flow together, and
you&#8217;ll feel a greatly improved sense of well-being.
<!--l. 36999--><p class="indent" >   4. Learn four ways of adjusting the breath:
<!--l. 37001--><p class="indent" >   a. in long and out long, b. in long and out short, c. in short and out long, d. in
short and out short.
<!--l. 37004--><p class="indent" >   Breathe whichever way is most comfortable for you. Or, better yet, learn to
breathe comfortably all four ways, because your physical condition and your breath
are always changing.
<!--l. 37008--><p class="indent" >   5. Become acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind &#8212; the resting
spots of the breath &#8212; and center your awareness on whichever one seems most
comfortable. A few of these bases are:
<!--l. 37012--><p class="indent" >   a. the tip of the nose, b. the middle of the head, c. the palate, d. the base of the
throat, e. the breastbone (the tip of the sternum), f. the navel (or a point just above
it).
<!--l. 37016--><p class="indent" >   If you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems, don&#8217;t focus on any
spot above the base of the throat. And don&#8217;t try to force the breath or put yourself
into a trance. Breathe freely and naturally. Let the mind be at ease with the breath
&#8212; but not to the point where it slips away.

<!--l. 37022--><p class="indent" >   6. Spread your awareness &#8212; your sense of conscious feeling &#8212; throughout the
entire body.
<!--l. 37025--><p class="indent" >   7. Unite the breath sensations throughout the body, letting them flow together
comfortably, keeping your awareness as broad as possible. Once you are
fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know in your body,
you&#8217;ll come to know all sorts of other aspects as well. The breath, by its
nature, has many facets: breath sensations flowing in the nerves, those flowing
around and about the nerves, those spreading from the nerves to every pore.
Beneficial breath sensations and harmful ones are mixed together by their very
nature.
<!--l. 37034--><p class="indent" >   To summarize: (a) for the sake of improving the energy already existing in every
part of your body, so that you can contend with such things as disease and pain; and
(b) for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already within you, so that it can become
a basis for the skills leading to release and purity of heart &#8212; you should always
bear these seven steps in mind, because they are absolutely basic to every
aspect of breath meditation. When you&#8217;ve mastered them, you will have cut a
main road. As for the side roads &#8212; the incidentals of breath meditation
&#8212; there are plenty of them, but they aren&#8217;t really important. You&#8217;ll be
perfectly safe if you stick to these seven steps and practice them as much as
possible.
<!--l. 37046--><p class="indent" >   Now we will summarize the methods of breath meditation under the headings of
jhana.
<!--l. 37049--><p class="indent" >   Jhana means to be absorbed or focused in a single object or preoccupation, as
when we deal with the breath.
<!--l. 37052--><p class="indent" >   1. The first jhana has five factors: (a) Directed thought (vitakka): Think of the
breath until you can recognize it clearly without getting distracted. (b) Singleness
of object (ekaggatarammana): Keep the mind with the breath. Don&#8217;t let
it stray after other objects. Watch over your thoughts so that they deal
only with the breath to the point where the breath becomes comfortable.
(The mind becomes one, at rest with the breath.) (c) Evaluation (vicara):
Gain a sense of how to let this comfortable breath sensation spread and
co-ordinate with the other breath sensations in the body. Let these breath
sensations spread until they all merge. Once the body has been soothed by the
breath, feelings of pain will grow calm. The body will be filled with good
breath energy. (The mind is focused exclusively on issues connected with the
breath.)
<!--l. 37066--><p class="indent" >   These three qualities must be brought together to bear on the same stream of
breathing for the first jhana to arise. This stream of breathing can then take you all
the way to the fourth jhana.
<!--l. 37070--><p class="indent" >   Directed thought, singleness of object and evaluation act as the causes. When the
causes are fully ripe, results will appear &#8212; (d) rapture (piti): a compelling sense of
fullness and refreshment for body and mind, going straight to the heart,
independent of all else. (e) Pleasure (sukha): physical ease arising from the body&#8217;s
being still and unperturbed (kaya-passaddhi); mental contentment arising
from the mind&#8217;s being at ease on its own, unperturbed, serene and exultant
(citta-passaddhi).

<!--l. 37079--><p class="indent" >   Rapture and pleasure are the results. The factors of the first jhana thus come
down simply to two sorts: causes and results.
<!--l. 37082--><p class="indent" >   As rapture and pleasure grow stronger, the breath becomes more subtle. The
longer you stay focused and absorbed, the more powerful the results become. This
enables you to set directed thought and evaluation (the preliminary ground-clearing)
aside, and &#8212; relying completely on a single factor, singleness of object &#8212; you enter
the second jhana (magga-citta, phala-citta).
<!--l. 37089--><p class="indent" >   2. The second jhana has three factors: rapture, pleasure and singleness of
object (magga-citta). This refers to the state of mind that has tasted the
results coming from the first jhana. Once you have entered the second level,
rapture and pleasure become stronger because they rely on a single cause,
singleness of object, which looks after the work from here on in: focusing on
the breath so that it becomes more and more refined, keeping steady and
still with a sense of refreshment and ease for both body and mind. The
mind is even more stable and intent than before. As you continue focusing,
rapture and pleasure become stronger and begin to expand and contract.
Continue focusing on the breath, moving the mind deeper to a more subtle
level to escape the motions of rapture and pleasure, and you enter the third
jhana.
<!--l. 37102--><p class="indent" >   3. The third jhana has two factors: pleasure and singleness of object. The body is
quiet, motionless and solitary. No feelings of pain arise to disturb it. The mind is
solitary and still. The breath is refined, free-flowing and broad. A radiance &#8212;
white like cotton wool &#8212; pervades the entire body, stilling all feelings of
physical and mental discomfort. Keep focused on looking after nothing but the
broad, refined breath. The mind is free: No thoughts of past or future disturb
it. The mind stands out on its own. The four properties &#8212; earth, water,
fire and wind &#8212; are in harmony throughout the body. You could almost
say that they&#8217;re pure throughout the entire body, because the breath has
the strength to control and take good care of the other properties, keeping
them harmonious and coordinated. Mindfulness is coupled with singleness of
object, which acts as the cause. The breath fills the body. Mindfulness fills the
body.
<!--l. 37118--><p class="indent" >   Focus on in: The mind is bright and powerful, the body is light. Feelings of
pleasure are still. Your sense of the body feels steady and even, with no slips or gaps
in your awareness, so you can let go of your sense of pleasure. The manifestations of
pleasure grow still, because the four properties are balanced and free from motion.
Singleness of object, the cause, has the strength to focus more heavily down, taking
you to the fourth jhana.
<!--l. 37126--><p class="indent" >   4. The fourth jhana has two factors: equanimity (upekkha) and singleness of
object, or mindfulness. Equanimity and singleness of object on the fourth jhana are
powerfully focused &#8212; solid, stable and sure. The breath element is absolutely quiet,
free from ripples and gaps. The mind, neutral and still, lets go of all preoccupations
with past and future. The breath, which forms the present, is still, like the ocean or
air when they are free from currents or waves. You can know distant sights, and
sounds, because the breath is even and unwavering, and so acts like a movie screen,
giving a clear reflection of whatever is projected onto it. Knowledge arises in the

mind: You know but stay neutral and still. The mind is neutral and still; the breath,
neutral and still; past, present and future are all neutral and still. This is true
singleness of object, focused on the unperturbed stillness of the breath. All
parts of the breath in the body connect so that you can breathe through
every pore. You don&#8217;t have to breathe through the nostrils, because the
in-and-out breath and the other aspects of the breath in the body form a
single, unified whole. All aspects of the breath energy are even and full. The
four properties all have the same characteristics. The mind is completely
still.
<!--l. 37146--><p class="indent" >   The focus is strong; the light, aglow. This is to know the great frame of reference.
The mind is beaming and bright &#8212; like the light of the sun, which unobstructed by
clouds or haze, illumines the earth with its rays.
<!--l. 37151--><p class="indent" >   The mind sheds light in all directions. The breath is radiant, the mind fully
radiant, due to the focusing of mindfulness.
<!--l. 37154--><p class="indent" >   The focus is strong; the light, aglow... The mind has power and authority. All four
of the frames of reference are gathered into one. There is no sense that, &#8217;That&#8217;s the
body... That&#8217;s a feeling... That&#8217;s the mind... That&#8217;s a mental quality.&#8217; There&#8217;s no
sense that they&#8217;re four, This is thus called the great frame of reference, because none
of the four are in any way separate.
<!--l. 37161--><p class="indent" >   The mind is firmly intent, centered and true, due to the strength of its
focus.
<!--l. 37164--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness and alertness converge into one: This is what is meant by the one
path (ekayana-magga) &#8212; the concord among the properties and frames of reference,
four in one, giving rise to great energy and wakefulness, the purifying inner fire
(tapas) that can thoroughly dispel all obscuring darkness.
<!--l. 37170--><p class="indent" >   As you focus more strongly on the radiance of the mind, the power that comes
from letting go of all preoccupations enables the mind to stand alone. You&#8217;re like a
person who has climbed to the top of a mountain and has the right to see in all
directions. The mind&#8217;s dwelling &#8212; the breath, which supports the mind&#8217;s freedom
&#8212; is in a heightened state, so the mind is able to see all things fashioned
(sankhara) clearly in terms of the Dhamma: as properties (dhatu),khandhas, and
sense media (ayatana). Just as a person who has taken a camera up in an
airplane can take pictures of practically everything below, so a person who has
reached this stage (lokavidu) can see the world and the Dhamma as they truly
are.
<!--l. 37182--><p class="indent" >   In addition, awareness of another sort, in the area of the mind &#8212; called
liberating insight, or the skill of release &#8212; also appears. The elements or
properties of the body acquire potency (kaya-siddhi); the mind, resilient power.
When you want knowledge of the world or the Dhamma, focus the mind
heavily and forcefully on the breath. As the concentrated power of the mind
strikes the pure element, intuitive knowledge will spring up in that element,
just as the needle of a record player, as it strikes a record, will give rise to
sounds. Once your mindfulness is focused on a pure object, then if you want
images, images will appear; if sounds, sounds will arise, whether near or far,
matters of the world or the Dhamma, concerning yourself or others, past,
present or future &#8212; whatever you want to know. As you focus down, think

of what you want to know, and it will appear. This is ñana &#8212; intuitive
sensitivity capable of knowing past, present and future &#8212; an important
level of awareness that you can know only for yourself. The elements are
like radio waves going through the air. If your mind and mindfulness are
strong, and your skills highly developed, you can use those elements to put
yourself in touch with the entire world, so that knowledge can arise within
you.
<!--l. 37203--><p class="indent" >   When you have mastered the fourth jhana, it can act as the basis for eight
skills:
<!--l. 37206--><p class="indent" >   1. Vipassana-ñana: clear intuitive insight into mental and physical phenomena as
they arise, remain and disband. This is a special sort of insight, coming solely from
training the mind. It can occur in two ways: (a) knowing without ever having thought
of the matter; and (b) knowing from having thought of the matter &#8212; but not after
a great deal of thought, as in the case of ordinary knowledge. Think for
an instant and it immediately becomes clear &#8212; just as a piece of cotton
wool soaked in gasoline, when you hold a match to it, bursts immediately
into flame. The intuition and insight here are that fast, and so differ from
ordinary discernment. 2. Manomayiddhi: the ability to use the mind to influence
events.
<!--l. 37218--><p class="indent" >   3. Iddhividhi: the ability to display supra-normal powers, e.g., creating
images in certain instances that certain groups of people will be able to
see.
<!--l. 37222--><p class="indent" >   4. Dibbasota: the ability to hear distant sounds.
<!--l. 37224--><p class="indent" >   5. Cetopariya-ñana: the ability to know the level &#8212; good or evil, high or low &#8212; of
other people&#8217;s minds.
<!--l. 37227--><p class="indent" >   6. Pubbenivasanussati-ñana: the ability to remember previous lifetimes. (If you
attain this skill, you&#8217;ll no longer have to wonder as to whether death is followed by
annihilation or rebirth.)
<!--l. 37231--><p class="indent" >   7. Dibbacakkhu: the ability to see gross and subtle images, both near and
far.
<!--l. 37234--><p class="indent" >   8. Asavakkhaya-ñana: the ability to reduce and eliminate the effluents of
defilement in the heart.
<!--l. 37237--><p class="indent" >   These eight skills come exclusively from the centering the mind, which is why I
have written this condensed guide to concentration and jhana, based on the
technique of keeping the breath in mind. If you aspire to the good that can come
from these things, you should turn your attention to training your own heart and
mind.
<!--l. 37243--><p class="indent" >   From The Path to Peace &amp; Freedom for the Mind
<!--l. 37245--><p class="indent" >   Virtue
<!--l. 37247--><p class="indent" >   There are three levels of virtue &#8212;
<!--l. 37249--><p class="indent" >   1. Hetthima-sila: normalcy of word and deed, which consists of three kinds of
bodily acts &#8212; not killing, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct; and four
kinds of speech &#8212; not lying, not speaking divisively, not saying anything coarse or
abusive, not speaking idly. If we class virtue on this level according to the wording of
the precepts and the groups of people who observe them, there are four &#8212; the five
precepts, the eight, the ten, and the 227 precepts. All of these deal with aspects of

behavior that should be abandoned, termed pahana-kicca. At the same time, the
Buddha directed us to develop good manners and proper conduct in the use
of the four necessities of life &#8212; food, clothing, shelter, and medicine &#8212; so
that our conduct in terms of thought, word, and deed will be orderly and
becoming. This aspect is termed bhavana-kicca, behavior we should work at
developing.
<!--l. 37264--><p class="indent" >   Observance of these precepts or rules &#8212; dealing merely with words and deeds &#8212;
forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue, which is what makes us into
full-fledged human beings (manussa-sampatti).
<!--l. 37269--><p class="indent" >   2. Majjhima-sila: the medium level of virtue, i.e., keeping watch over your words
and deeds so that they cause no harm; and, in addition, keeping watch over your
thoughts so as to keep them upright in three ways &#8212;
<!--l. 37274--><p class="indent" >   a. Anabhijjha-visamalobha: not coveting things that do not belong to you and
that lie beyond your scope or powers; not focusing your thoughts on such things; not
building what are called castles in the air. The Buddha taught us to tend to the
wealth we already have so that it can grow on its own. The wealth we already
have, if we use our intelligence and ingenuity, will draw more wealth our way
without our having to waste time and energy by being covetous or greedy. For
example, suppose we have a single banana tree: If we water it, give it fertilizer,
loosen the soil around its roots, and guard it in other ways, our single banana
tree will eventually give rise to an increase of other banana trees. In other
words, if we&#8217;re shrewd we can turn whatever wealth we have into a basis for a
livelihood. But if we lack intelligence &#8212; if our hearts simply want to get, without
wanting work &#8212; then even if we acquire a great deal of wealth, we won&#8217;t be
able to support ourselves. Thus, greed of this sort, in which we focus our
desires above and beyond our capacities, is classed as a wrong kind of mental
action.
<!--l. 37292--><p class="indent" >   b. Abyapada: abandoning thoughts of ill will, hatred, and vengeance, and
developing thoughts of benevolence and good will instead; thinking of the good
aspects of the people who have angered us. When people make us angry, it comes
from the fact that our dealings with them &#8212; in which we associate with and assist
one another &#8212; sometimes lead to disappointment. This gives rise to dislike and
irritation, which in turn cause us to brood, so that we develop hurt feelings that grow
into anger and thoughts of retaliation. Thus we should regard such people from many
angles, for ordinarily as human beings they should have some good to them. If they
don&#8217;t act well toward us, they may at least speak well to us. Or if they don&#8217;t
act or speak well to us, perhaps their thoughts may be well-meaning to
at least some extent. Thus, when you find your thoughts heading in the
direction of anger or dislike, you should sit down and think in two ways
&#8212;
<!--l. 37307--><p class="indent" >   (1) Try to think of whatever ways that person has been good to you. When these
things come to mind, they&#8217;ll give rise to feelings of affection, love, and good will. This
is one way.
<!--l. 37311--><p class="indent" >   (2) Anger is something worthless, like the scum that floats on the surface of a
lake. If we&#8217;re stupid, we won&#8217;t get to drink the clean water that lies underneath; or if
we drink the scum, we may catch a disease. A person who is bad to you is like

someone sunk in filth. If you&#8217;re stupid enough to hate or be angry with
such people, it&#8217;s as if you wanted to go sit in the filth with them. Is that
what you want? Think about this until any thoughts of ill will and anger
disappear.
<!--l. 37319--><p class="indent" >   c. Samma-ditthi: abandoning wrong views and mental darkness. If our minds lack
the proper training and education, we may come to think that we and all other living
beings are born simply as accidents of nature; that &#8217;father&#8217; and &#8217;mother&#8217; have no
special meaning; that good and evil don&#8217;t exist. Such views deviate from the truth.
They can dissuade us from restraining the evil that lies within us and from searching
for and fostering the good. To believe that there&#8217;s no good or evil, that death is
annihilation, is Wrong View &#8212; a product of faulty thinking and poor discernment,
seeing things for what they aren&#8217;t. So we should abandon such views and educate
ourselves, searching for knowledge of the Dhamma and associating with people
wiser than we, so that they can show us the proper path. We&#8217;ll then be able
to reform our views and make them Right, which is one form of mental
uprightness.
<!--l. 37334--><p class="indent" >   Virtue on this level, when we can maintain it well, will qualify us to be heavenly
beings. The qualities of heavenly beings, which grow out of human values, will turn
us into human beings who are divine in our virtues, for to guard our thoughts, words,
and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetime. This is one
aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the middle level of
virtue.
<!--l. 37341--><p class="indent" >   3. Uparima-sila: higher virtue, where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the area
of mental activity. There are two sides to higher virtue &#8212;
<!--l. 37345--><p class="indent" >   a. PAHANA-KICCA: qualities to be abandoned, which are of five sorts
&#8212;
<!--l. 37348--><p class="indent" >   (1) Kamachanda: affection, desire, laxity, infatuation. (2) Byapada: ill will and
hatred.
<!--l. 37351--><p class="indent" >   (3) Thina-middha: discouragement, drowsiness, sloth.
<!--l. 37353--><p class="indent" >   (4) Uddhacca-kukkucca: restlessness and anxiety.
<!--l. 37355--><p class="indent" >   (5) Vicikiccha: doubt, uncertainty, indecision.
<!--l. 37357--><p class="indent" >   Discussion
<!--l. 37359--><p class="indent" >   (1) Ill will (byapada) lies at the essence of killing (panatipata), for it causes us to
destroy our own goodness and that of others &#8212; and when our mind can kill off our
own goodness, what&#8217;s to keep us from killing other people and animals as
well?
<!--l. 37364--><p class="indent" >   (2) Restlessness (uddhacca) lies at the essence of taking what is not given
(adinnadana). The mind wanders about, taking hold of other people&#8217;s affairs,
sometimes their good points, sometimes their bad. To fasten onto their good points
isn&#8217;t too serious, for it can give us at least some nourishment. As long as we&#8217;re going
to steal other people&#8217;s business and make it our own, we might as well take their
silver and gold. Their bad points, though, are like trash they&#8217;ve thrown away &#8212;
scraps and bones, with nothing of any substance &#8212; and yet even so we let
the mind feed on them. When we know that other people are possessive of
their bad points and guard them well, and yet we still take hold of these
things to think about, it should be classed as a form of taking what isn&#8217;t

given.
<!--l. 37377--><p class="indent" >   (3) Sensual desires (kamachanda) lie at the essence of sensual misconduct. The
mind feels an attraction for sensual objects &#8212; thoughts of past or future sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations &#8212; or for sensual defilements &#8212; passion,
aversion, or delusion &#8212; to the point where we forget ourselves. Mental states
such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety in sensual
matters.
<!--l. 37385--><p class="indent" >   (4) Doubt (vicikiccha) lies at the essence of lying. In other words, our
minds are unsure, with nothing reliable or true to them. We have no firm
principles and so drift along under the influence of all kinds of thoughts and
preoccupations.
<!--l. 37390--><p class="indent" >   (5) Drowsiness (thina-middha) is intoxication &#8212; discouragement, dullness,
forgetfulness, with no mindfulness or restraint watching over the mind. This is what
it means to be drugged or drunk.
<!--l. 37394--><p class="indent" >   All of these unwise qualities are things we should eliminate by training the heart
along the lines of:
<!--l. 37397--><p class="indent" >   b. BHAVANA-KICCA: qualities to be developed &#8212;
<!--l. 37399--><p class="indent" >   (1) Mindfulness (sati): Start out by thinking of an object, such as your in-and-out
breathing. Use mindfulness to steady the mind in its object. Vitakka, thinking in this
way, is what kills off sensual desires, in that the discipline of mindfulness keeps the
mind from slipping off into external objects. (2) Vicara: Evaluate and be observant.
Make yourself aware of whether or not you&#8217;ve received a sense of comfort and
relaxation from your breathing. If not, tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of
ways: e.g., in long and out long, in long and out short, in short and out
short, in short and out long, in slow and out slow, in fast and out fast, in
gently and out gently, in strong and out strong, in throughout the body and
out throughout the body. Adjust the breath until it gives good results to
both body and mind, and you&#8217;ll be able to kill off feelings of ill will and
hatred.
<!--l. 37413--><p class="indent" >   (3) Piti: When you get good results &#8212; for instance, when the subtle breath
sensations in the body merge and flow together, permeating the entire sense of the
body &#8212; the breath is like an electric wire; the various parts of the body, such as the
bones, are like electricity poles; mindfulness and self-awareness are like a
power source; and awareness is thus bright and radiant. Both body and mind
feel full and satisfied. This is piti, or rapture, which can kill off feelings of
drowsiness.
<!--l. 37422--><p class="indent" >   (4) Sukha: Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared, a sense
of pleasure and ease for body and mind arises. This pleasure is what kills off
restlessness.
<!--l. 37426--><p class="indent" >   (5) Ekaggata: Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distance. The mind reaches
oneness of object in a state of normalcy and equilibrium. This normalcy of mind,
which is maintained through the power of the discipline of mindfulness (sati-vinaya),
forms the essence of virtue: firmness, steadiness, stability. And the resulting flavor or
nourishment of virtue is tranquillity, light-heartedness, and a sense of independence
for the mind. When freedom of this sort arises within us, this is called the
development of silanussati, the mindfulness of virtue. This is virtue that attains

excellence &#8212; leading to the paths, their fruitions, and nibbana &#8212; and thus can be
called uparima-sila, higher virtue.
<!--l. 37438--><p class="indent" >   To summarize, there are three levels of virtue: external virtue, intermediate
virtue, and internal virtue. In ultimate terms, however, there are two &#8212;
<!--l. 37442--><p class="indent" >   1. Mundane virtue: virtue connected with the world, in which we maintain the
principles of ordinary human morality but are as yet unable to reach the
transcendent levels: stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship.
We can&#8217;t yet cut the Fetters (sanyojana) that tie the heart to the influences of all the
worlds. This is thus called mundane virtue.
<!--l. 37449--><p class="indent" >   2. Transcendent virtue: virtue that&#8217;s constant and sure, going straight to the
heart, bathing the heart with its nourishment. This arises from the practice of
tranquillity meditation and insight meditation. tranquillity meditation forms the
cause, and insight meditation the result: discovering the true nature of the properties,
aggregates (khandhas), and senses; seeing clearly the four Noble Truths, in
proportion to our practice of the Path, and abandoning the first three of the Fetters
&#8212;
<!--l. 37458--><p class="indent" >   a. Sakkaya-ditthi (self-identity views): views that see the body or the aggregates
as part of the self or as belonging to the self. Ordinarily, we may be convinced that
views of this sort are mistaken, yet we can&#8217;t really abandon them. But when we
clearly see that they&#8217;re wrong for sure, this is called Right View &#8212; seeing things as
they truly are &#8212; which can eliminate such wrong views as seeing the body as
belonging to the self, or the self as the five aggregates, or the five aggregates as part
of the self. b. Vicikiccha: doubt concerning what&#8217;s genuine and true, and what&#8217;s
counterfeit and false. The power of Right View enables us to see that the quality to
which we awaken exists at all times; and that the true qualities that cause
us to awaken also exist and are made effective through the power of the
practices we&#8217;re following. Our knowledge is definite and true. Our doubts
concerning the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha are cleared up for
good. This is called becoming a niyata-puggala, a person who is certain and
sure.
<!--l. 37475--><p class="indent" >   c. Silabbata-paramasa: When the heart abandons this Fetter, it no longer
dotes on theories concerning moral virtue; it&#8217;s no longer stuck merely on the
level of manners and actions. Good and evil are accomplished through the
heart; activities and actions are something separate. Even though people who
reach this level do good &#8212; taking the precepts, making gifts and offerings,
or meditating in line with the good customs of the world &#8212; they&#8217;re not
caught up on any of these things, because their hearts have reached the
nourishment of virtue. They aren&#8217;t stuck on the particulars (byañjana), i.e., their
actions and activities; nor are they stuck on the purpose (attha), i.e., the
meaning or intent of their various good manners. Their hearts dwell in the
nourishment of virtue: tranquillity, stability, normalcy of mind. Just as a
person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating his
body isn&#8217;t stuck on either the food or its flavor &#8212; because he&#8217;s received
the benefits of the nourishment it provides &#8212; in the same way, the hearts
of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on
actions or manners, particulars or purposes, because they&#8217;ve tasted virtue&#8217;s

nourishment.
<!--l. 37495--><p class="indent" >   This is thus classed as transcendent virtue, the first stage of nibbana. Even
though such people may be destined for further rebirth, they&#8217;re apart from the
ordinary. Anyone whose practice reaches this level can be counted as fortunate, as
having received dependable wealth, like ingots of gold. Just as gold can be used as
currency all over the world because it has special value for all human beings
&#8212; unlike paper currency, whose use is limited to specific countries &#8212; in
the same way, a heart that&#8217;s truly attained virtue has a value in this life
that will remain constant in lives to come. Thus, a person who has reached
this level has received part of the Noble Wealth of those who practice the
religion.
<!--l. 37507--><p class="indent" >   Concentration
<!--l. 37509--><p class="indent" >   Concentration has three levels &#8212;
<!--l. 37511--><p class="indent" >   1. Kamavacara-khanika-samadhi: (momentary concentration in the sensory
realm): The mind keeps thinking, coming to rest, and running along after
worthwhile preoccupations &#8212; either internal or external &#8212; on the sensory level
(kamavacara-kusala): sights, sounds, smells, flavors, tactile sensations, or ideas. An
example of this is when the mind becomes quiet and rested for a moment as
we sit listening to a sermon or chanting. In other words, the mind grows
still for momentary periods in the same way that a person walks: One foot
takes a step while the other foot rests on the ground, providing the energy
needed to reach one&#8217;s goal. This is thus called momentary concentration,
something possessed by people all over the world. Whether or not we practice
concentration, the mind is always behaving this way by its very nature. This is
called the &#8217;bhavanga-citta&#8217; or &#8217;bhavanga-pada&#8217;: The mind stops for a moment
and then moves on. In developing higher levels of concentration, we have to
start out with this ordinary level as our basis. Otherwise, the higher levels
probably wouldn&#8217;t be possible. Still, this level of concentration can&#8217;t be
used as a basis for discernment, which is why we have to go further in our
practice.
<!--l. 37530--><p class="indent" >   2. Rupavacara-upacara-samadhi (threshold concentration in the realm
of form): This refers to the first jhana, in which the mind comes inward
to rest on a single preoccupation within the body, fixing its attention, for
example, on the in-and-out breath. When the mind stays with its one object,
this is called ekaggata. At the same time, there&#8217;s mindfulness keeping the
breath in mind: This is called vitakka. The mind then adjusts and expands
the various aspects of the breath throughout the entire body, evaluating
them mindfully with complete circumspection: This is called self-awareness
(sampajañña) or vicara, which is the factor aware of causes and results.
Mindfulness, the cause, is what does the work. Thus vitakka and vicara cooperate
in focusing on the same topic. We are then aware of the results as they
arise &#8212; feelings of fullness, pleasure, and ease (piti and sukha) for body and
mind. At this point, the mind lets down its burdens to rest for a while, like a
person walking along who meets with something pleasing and attractive, and
so stops to look: Both feet are standing still, stepping neither forward nor
back.

<!--l. 37548--><p class="indent" >   If we aren&#8217;t skilled enough to go on any further, we will then retreat. If we see
results &#8212; such as signs and visions &#8212; arising in the mind, we may get excited and so
cause our original preoccupation to waver or fade. Like a person sitting on a
chair: If he sees something appealing in front of him, he may become so
interested that he leans forward and reaches out his hand; he may even
begin to budge a bit from his seat or stand up completely. In the same way,
if we get engrossed in visions, thoughts, or views when we&#8217;re engaged in
threshold concentration, we can become excited and pleased &#8212; we may
even think that we&#8217;ve reached the transcendent &#8212; and this can cause our
concentration to degenerate. If we try to do it again and can&#8217;t, we may
then seize the opportunity to say that we&#8217;ve gone beyond the practice of
concentration, so that we can now take the way of discernment &#8212; thinking,
pondering, and letting go in line with nothing more than our own views
and ideas. This, though, is not likely to succeed, because our knowledge
has no firm basis or core, like a wheel with no axle or hub: How can it get
anywhere? The power of threshold concentration, if we don&#8217;t watch after it well,
is bound to deteriorate, and we&#8217;ll be left with nothing but old, left-over
concepts.
<!--l. 37569--><p class="indent" >   3. Rupavacara-appana-samadhi (fixed penetration in the realm of form): This
refers to the practice of all four levels of rupa jhana. The first jhana has five factors:
thinking, evaluating, fullness, pleasure, and singleness of object. The second level has
three: fullness, pleasure, and singleness of object. The third has two: pleasure and
singleness of object; and the fourth has two: equanimity and singleness of
object.
<!--l. 37576--><p class="indent" >   Discussion
<!--l. 37578--><p class="indent" >   Fixed penetration in the realm of form means that the mind focuses on the
internal sense of the body, remaining steadily with a single object &#8212; such as the
in-and-out breath &#8212; until it reaches jhana, beginning with the first level, which is
composed of thinking, evaluating, fullness, pleasure, and singleness of object. When
you see results arising, focus in on those results and they will then turn into the
second level, which has three factors: fullness, pleasure and singleness of object. As
your focus becomes stronger, it causes the sense of fullness to waver, so you can now
let go of that sense of fullness, and your concentration turns into the third jhana, in
which only two factors are left: pleasure and singleness of object. The mind has
few burdens; its focus is strong and the sense of inner light is radiant. This
causes the feeling of pleasure to waver, so that you can let go of that sense
of pleasure, and the mind attains oneness in a very subtle preoccupation.
The preoccupation doesn&#8217;t waver and neither does the mind. It stands firm
in its freedom. This is called equanimity and singleness of object, which
form the fourth jhana. Mindfulness is powerful. Self-awareness is complete.
Both are centered on a single preoccupation without getting snagged on any
other allusions or perceptions. This mental state is called the fourth jhana,
which has two factors: Equanimity, or stillness, is the external attitude of the
mind; as for the real factors, they&#8217;re mindfulness and singleness, steady and
firm.
<!--l. 37602--><p class="indent" >   The mind experiences a sense of brightness, the radiance that comes from its state

of fixed penetration. Mindfulness and self-awareness are circumspect and all-round,
and so give rise to skill and proficiency in practicing jhana &#8212; in focusing, staying in
place, stepping through the various levels, withdrawing, going back and forth. When
the mind behaves as you want it to, no matter when you practice, only then
does this truly qualify as fixed penetration, the basis for the arising of three
qualities: intuitive knowledge (ñana), discernment (pañña), and cognitive skill
(vijja).
<!--l. 37612--><p class="indent" >   Intuitive knowledge here refers to knowledge or sensitivity of an extraordinary
sort. For example &#8212;
<!--l. 37615--><p class="indent" >   Pubbenivasanussati-ñana: the ability to remember previous lives.
Cutupapata-ñana: the ability to focus on the death and rebirth of other living beings
&#8212; sometimes in good destinations, sometimes in bad &#8212; together with the
causes that lead them to be reborn in such ways. This gives rise to a sense of
weariness and disenchantment with sensations and mental acts, body and
mind.
<!--l. 37622--><p class="indent" >   Asavakkhaya-ñana: knowing how to put an end to the defilements of the heart in
accordance with the knowledge &#8212; the clear vision of the four Noble Truths &#8212; that
accompanies the particular transcendent path reached. And there are still other
forms of extraordinary knowledge, such as iddhividhi, the ability to display
supernormal powers, to make an image of oneself appear to other people; dibbasota,
clairaudience; dibbacakkhu, clairvoyance &#8212; i.e., the ability to see objects at
tremendous distances.
<!--l. 37631--><p class="indent" >   Discernment refers to discriminating knowledge, clear comprehension, knowledge
in line with the truth. For example &#8212;
<!--l. 37634--><p class="indent" >   Attha-patisambhida: acumen with regard to aims and results; thorough-going
comprehension of cause and effect; knowing, for example, how stress is caused by
ignorance and craving, and how the disbanding of stress is caused by the intuitive
discernment that forms the Path; comprehending the meaning and aims of the
Buddha&#8217;s various teachings and knowing how to explain them so that other people
will understand &#8212; being able, for instance, to summarize a long passage without
distorting its meaning.
<!--l. 37643--><p class="indent" >   Dhamma-patisambhida: acumen with regard to mental qualities; knowing how to
explain deep and subtle points so that other people will understand.
<!--l. 37646--><p class="indent" >   Nirutti-patisambhida: acumen with regard to different languages. According to
the texts, this includes knowing foreign languages and the languages of various other
living beings by means of the eye of discernment (pañña cakkhu).
<!--l. 37651--><p class="indent" >   Patibhana-patisambhida: acumen with regard to expression; being fluent in
making explanations and quick-witted in debate; knowing the most strategic way to
express things.
<!--l. 37655--><p class="indent" >   All of these forms of discernment can arise from training the mind to attain fixed
penetration. Vijja &#8212; clear, open knowledge, free from any further concealments; and
aloka &#8212; brilliance, radiance streaming out in all directions &#8212; enable us to see the
true nature of sensations and mental acts, in accordance with our powers of intuitive
discernment.
<!--l. 37662--><p class="indent" >   Cognitive skill refers to clear, uncanny knowledge that arises from the mind&#8217;s
being firmly fixed in jhana. There are eight sorts &#8212;

<!--l. 37665--><p class="indent" >   (1) Vipassana-ñana: clear comprehension of physical sensations and mental acts
(rupa, nama).(2) Manomayiddhi: psychic powers, influencing events through the
power of thought.
<!--l. 37669--><p class="indent" >   (3) Iddhividhi: the ability to display powers, making one&#8217;s body appear in a
variety of ways.
<!--l. 37672--><p class="indent" >   (4) Dibba-cakkhu: clairvoyance.
<!--l. 37674--><p class="indent" >   (5) Dibba-sota: clairaudience.
<!--l. 37676--><p class="indent" >   (6) Cetopariya-ñana: the ability to know the mental states of other people.
<!--l. 37679--><p class="indent" >   (7) Pubbenivasanussati-ñana: the ability to remember previous lives.
<!--l. 37681--><p class="indent" >   (8) Asavakkhaya-ñana: the ability to put an end to the effluents that defile the
heart.
<!--l. 37684--><p class="indent" >   Thus, jhana on the level of fixed penetration is extremely important. It can give
us support on all sides &#8212; on the level of the world and of the Dhamma &#8212; and can
bring success in our various activities, both in our worldly affairs and in our Dhamma
duties, leading us on to the transcendent.
<!--l. 37690--><p class="indent" >   To summarize, there are two kinds of concentration:
<!--l. 37692--><p class="indent" >   1. That which gives rise to mundane knowledge: This is termed mundane
concentration.
<!--l. 37695--><p class="indent" >   2. That which helps us to fulfill our duties on the level of the Dhamma, leading to
vipassana-ñana or asavakkhaya-ñana, the knowledge that enables us &#8212; in accordance
with the discernment and insight that arise &#8212; to abandon or cut off completely the
mental tendencies that lean in the direction of the Fetters: This is termed
transcendent concentration.
<!--l. 37702--><p class="indent" >   Discernment
<!--l. 37704--><p class="indent" >   Discernment is of three kinds &#8212;
<!--l. 37706--><p class="indent" >   1. Sutamaya-pañña: discernment that comes from studying. 2. Cintamaya-pañña:
discernment that comes from reflecting.
<!--l. 37709--><p class="indent" >   3. Bhavanamaya-pañña: discernment that comes from developing the
mind.
<!--l. 37711--><p class="indent" >   Discussion
<!--l. 37713--><p class="indent" >   l. Sutamaya-pañña refers to the discernment that comes from having listened a
great deal, like the Venerable Ananda. Listening here, though, includes studying and
taking interest in a variety of ways: paying attention, taking notes, asking
questions, and taking part in discussions so as to become quick-witted and
astute.
<!--l. 37719--><p class="indent" >   Education of all kinds comes down to two sorts: (a) learning the basic units,
such as the letters of the alphabet, their sound and pronunciation, so as to
understand their accepted usage; and (b) learning how to put them together &#8212; for
instance, how to combine the letters so as to give rise to words and meanings
&#8212; as when we complete our elementary education so that we won&#8217;t be at
a loss when we&#8217;re called on to read and write in the course of making a
living.
<!--l. 37727--><p class="indent" >   In the area of the religion, we have to study the letters of the Pali alphabet,
their combinations, their meanings, and their pronunciation. If we don&#8217;t
understand clearly, we should take an interest in asking questions. If we have
trouble memorizing, we should take an interest in jotting down notes as a

way of aiding our memory and expanding our concepts. In addition, we
have to study by means of our senses. For example, when we see a visual
object, we should find out its truth. When we hear sounds or words, we
should find out their truth. When we smell an aroma, we should consider it
to see what it comes from. We should take an interest in flavors so that
we know what they come from, and in tactile sensations &#8212; the heat and
cold that touch the body &#8212; by studying such things as the way weather
behaves.
<!--l. 37741--><p class="indent" >   All of these forms of education are ways of giving rise to astuteness &#8212; both
in the area of the world and in the area of the Dhamma &#8212; because they
constitute a basic level of knowledge, like the primary education offered in
schools.
<!--l. 37746--><p class="indent" >   2. Cintamaya-pañña refers to thinking and evaluating so as to learn the meaning
and truth of one&#8217;s beginning education. This level of education draws out the
meaning of the knowledge we have gained through studying. When we gain
information, we should reflect on it until we understand it so that we will be led by
our sense of reason and not by gullibility or ignorance. This is like a person who has
used his knowledge of the alphabet to gain knowledge from books to complete his
secondary education. Such a person has reached the level where he can think things
through clearly.
<!--l. 37756--><p class="indent" >   In the area of the Dhamma, the same holds true. Once we have learned the basics,
we should research and think through the content of the Teaching until we give rise
to an understanding so that we can conduct ourselves correctly in line with the
methods and aims taught by the sages of the past. This level of discernment is what
prepares us to conduct ourselves properly in line with the true essence of the
Doctrine and Discipline. This is classed as an aspect of pariyatti dhamma, Dhamma
on the level of theory. By learning the language and meaning of the Teaching, we can
become astute as far as theory is concerned; but if we don&#8217;t use that knowledge to
train ourselves, it&#8217;s as if we studied a profession &#8212; such as law &#8212; but then
went out to become bandits, so that our knowledge wouldn&#8217;t give its proper
results. For this reason, we&#8217;ve been taught still another method, which is the
well-spring of discernment or mastery &#8212; i.e., the mental activity termed
bhavanamaya-pañña.
<!--l. 37772--><p class="indent" >   3. Bhavanamaya-pañña: discernment that arises exclusively from the
practice of concentration. In other words, this level of discernment isn&#8217;t
related to the old observations we have gained from the past, because our
old observations are bound to obscure the new observations, endowed with
the truth, that can arise only right at the mind. When you engage in this
form of practice, focus exclusively on the present, taking note of a single
thing, not getting involved with past or future. Steady the mind, bringing it
into the present. Gather virtue, concentration, and discernment all into the
present. Think of your meditation object and bring your powers of evaluation
to bear on it &#8212; say, by immersing mindfulness in the body, focusing on
such objects as the in-and-out breath. When you do this, knowledge will
arise.
<!--l. 37785--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Ñanam udapadi&#8217;: Intuitive knowledge of things we have never before

studied or known will appear. For example: pubbenivasanussati-ñana &#8212; the
ability to remember our present life and past lives; cutupapata-ñana &#8212; the
ability to know living beings as they die and are reborn &#8212; well or poorly,
happily or miserably &#8212; knowing the causes and results of how they fare;
asavakkhaya-ñana &#8212; the ability to cleanse ourselves of the effluents that defile the
mind, thinning them out or eliminating them altogether, as we are able. These three
forms of knowledge don&#8217;t arise for people who simply study or think things
through in ordinary ways. They form a mental skill that arises from the
practice of concentration and are an aspect of Dhamma on the level of practice
(patipatti-dhamma).
<!--l. 37798--><p class="indent" >   Another aspect &#8212; &#8217;pañña udapadi&#8217;: Clear discernment of the true nature of the
properties (dhatu), aggregates, and sense media arises. We can focus on these things
by way of the mind and know them in terms of the four Noble Truths: stress
(dukkha), which arises from a cause (samudaya), i.e., ignorance and craving; and
then nirodha, the ceasing and disbanding of stress, which occurs as the result of a
cause, i.e., the Path (magga), composed of practices for the mind. These things can
be known by means of the discernment that arises exclusively and directly within us
and is termed the eye of discernment or the eye of Dhamma: the eye of the mind,
awakening from its slumbers.
<!--l. 37809--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Vijja udapadi&#8217;: The eight forms of cognitive skill, which follow the laws of cause
and effect &#8212; means of practice that bring us results &#8212; can arise in a quiet
mind.
<!--l. 37813--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Aloko udapadi&#8217;: Brightness, clarity, relief, and emptiness arise in such a
mind.
<!--l. 37816--><p class="indent" >   Thus, the discernment that results from developing the mind differs from the
beginning stages of discernment that come from studying and reflecting. Study and
reflection are classed as Dhamma on the level of theory, and can give only a
preliminary level of knowledge. They&#8217;re like a person who has awakened but has yet
to open his eyes. The discernment that comes from developing the mind, though, is
like waking up and seeing the truth &#8212; past, present, and future &#8212; in all four
directions. We can clearly see stress, its cause, its disbanding, and the Path to its
disbanding, and so can abandon the first set of Fetters. Our hearts will then
flow to nibbana, just as the water in a mountain cataract is sure to flow to
the sea. Our hearts will flow to their natural truth: the mental fullness and
completeness of a person who has practiced mental development until discernment
arises within. We will meet with a special form of wisdom &#8212; transcendent
wisdom &#8212; whose power will stay with us always, a quality that&#8217;s certain and
sure, termed certain truth, certain wisdom, making us people certain for
nibbana.
<!--l. 37834--><p class="indent" >   So this level of discernment &#8212; termed the discernment of liberating insight &#8212; is
especially important. It arises on its own, not from cogitating along the lines of old
concepts we&#8217;ve learned, but from abandoning them. Old concepts are what obscure
the new knowledge ready to arise.
<!--l. 37840--><p class="indent" >   The nature of liberating insight is like an electric light: Simply press the switch
once, and things all around are made bright. In the same way, when the mind reaches
a stage of readiness, insight will arise in a single mental instant, and everything will

become clear: properties, aggregates, and the sense media. We&#8217;ll know, on the one
hand, what&#8217;s inconstant (aniccam), stressful (dukkham), and not-self (anatta);
and on the other hand, what&#8217;s uncommon, i.e., niccam &#8212; what&#8217;s constant
and true; sukham &#8212; true happiness, termed niramisa-sukha; and atta &#8212;
the self. The eye of the mind can know both sides and let go both ways.
It&#8217;s attached neither to what&#8217;s inconstant, stressful, and not-self; nor to
what&#8217;s constant (niccam), good (sukham), and right (atta). It can let these
things go, in line with their true nature. The knowledge that comes from
discernment, cognitive skill, and intuitive insight, it can let go as well. It isn&#8217;t
attached to views &#8212; for there&#8217;s yet another, separate sort of reality that has
no &#8217;this&#8217; or &#8217;that.&#8217; In other words, it has no sense of &#8217;I.&#8217; It lets go of the
assumptions that, &#8217;That&#8217;s the self,&#8217; &#8217;That&#8217;s not the self,&#8217; &#8217;That&#8217;s constant,&#8217; &#8217;That&#8217;s
inconstant,&#8217; &#8217;That arises,&#8217; &#8217;That doesn&#8217;t arise.&#8217; It can let go of these things
completely. That&#8217;s the Dhamma, and yet it doesn&#8217;t hold onto the Dhamma, which
is why we say that the Dhamma is not-self. It also doesn&#8217;t hold on to the
view that says, &#8217;not-self.&#8217; It lets go of views, causes, and effects, and isn&#8217;t
attached to anything at all dealing with wordings or meanings, conventions or
practices.
<!--l. 37865--><p class="indent" >   This, then, is discernment that arises from the development of the mind.
<!--l. 37868--><p class="indent" >   To conclude: The discernment that comes from studying and reflecting is classed
as Dhamma on the level of theory. The discernment that comes from developing the
mind is classed as Dhamma on the level of practice. The results that arise are two
&#8212;
<!--l. 37873--><p class="indent" >   1. Mundane discernment: comprehension &#8212; of the world and the Dhamma &#8212;
falling under mundane influences and subject to change.
<!--l. 37877--><p class="indent" >   2. Transcendent discernment: awareness that goes beyond the ordinary, giving rise
to clear realization within. People who reach this level are said to have awakened and
opened their eyes, which is what is meant by &#8217;Buddho.&#8217;
<!--l. 37882--><p class="indent" >   Dhamma Talks
<!--l. 37884--><p class="indent" >   Insight isn&#8217;t something that can be taught. It&#8217;s something you have to give
rise to within yourself. It&#8217;s not something you simply memorize and talk
about. If we were to teach it just so we could memorize it, I can guarantee
that it wouldn&#8217;t take five hours. But if you wanted to understand one word
of it, three years might not even be enough. Memorizing gives rise simply
to memories. Acting is what gives rise to the truth. This is why it takes
effort and persistence for you to understand and master this skill on your
own.
<!--l. 37893--><p class="indent" >   When insight arises, you&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s what, where it&#8217;s come from, and where
it&#8217;s going &#8212; as when we see a lantern burning brightly: We know that, &#8217;That&#8217;s the
flame... That&#8217;s the smoke... That&#8217;s the light.&#8217; We know how these things arise from
mixing what with what, and where the flame goes when we put out the lantern. All
of this is the skill of insight.
<!--l. 37900--><p class="indent" >   Some people say that tranquillity meditation and insight meditation are two
separate things &#8212; but how can that be true? tranquillity meditation is &#8217;stopping,&#8217;
insight meditation is &#8217;thinking&#8217; that leads to clear knowledge. When there&#8217;s clear
knowledge, the mind stops still and stays put. They&#8217;re all part of the same

thing.
<!--l. 37906--><p class="indent" >   Knowing has to come from stopping. If you don&#8217;t stop, how can you know? For
instance, if you&#8217;re sitting in a car or a boat that is traveling fast and you try to look
at the people or things passing by right next to you along the way, you can&#8217;t see
clearly who&#8217;s who or what&#8217;s what. But if you stop still in one place, you&#8217;ll be able to
see things clearly.
<!--l. 37913--><p class="indent" >   Or even closer to home: When we speak, there has to be a pause between each
phrase. If you tried to talk without any pauses at all, would anyone be able to
understand what you said?
<!--l. 37917--><p class="indent" >   This is why we first have to make the mind stop to be quiet and still.
When the mind stays still in a state of normalcy, concentration arises and
discernment follows. This is something you have to work at and do for yourself.
Don&#8217;t simply believe what others say. Get so that you know &#8217;Oh! Oh! Oh!&#8217;
from within, and not just &#8217;Oh? Oh? Oh?&#8217;from what people say. Don&#8217;t take
the good things they say and stick them in your heart. You have to make
these things your own by getting them to arise from within you. Spending
one dollar of your own money is better than spending 100 dollars you&#8217;ve
borrowed from someone else. If you use borrowed money, you have to worry
because you&#8217;re in debt. If you use your own money, there&#8217;s nothing to worry
about.
<!--l. 37929--><p class="indent" >   Stopping is what gives rise to strength. If a man is walking or running, he can&#8217;t
put up a good fight with anyone, because the advantage lies with the person standing
still, not with the person walking or running. This is why we&#8217;re taught to make the
mind stop still so that it can gain strength. Then it will be able to start walking
again with strength and agility.
<!--l. 37936--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s true that we have two feet, but when we walk we have to step with one foot
at a time. If you try to step with both feet at once, you won&#8217;t get anywhere. Or if you
try to walk with just one foot, you can&#8217;t do that either. When the right foot stops,
the left foot has to take a step. When the left foot stops, the right foot has to take a
step. You have to stop with one foot and step with the other if you&#8217;re going to walk
with any strength because the strength comes from the foot that has stopped, not
from the foot taking a step. One side has to stop while the other side takes a
step. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have no support and are sure to fall down. If you
don&#8217;t believe me, try stepping with both feet at once and see how far you
get.
<!--l. 37948--><p class="indent" >   In the same way, tranquillity and insight have to go together. You first have to
make the mind stop in tranquillity and then take a step in your investigation: This is
insight meditation. The understanding that arises is discernment. To let go of your
attachment to that understanding is release.
<!--l. 37954--><p class="indent" >   So stopping is the factor that gives rise to strength, knowledge, and discernment
&#8212; the fixed mind that knows both the world and the Dhamma in a state of
heightened virtue, heightened consciousness, and heightened discernment leading on
to the transcendent.
<!--l. 37959--><p class="indent" >   * * *
<!--l. 37961--><p class="indent" >   To get full results from our meditation, the mind has to give the orders.
Mindfulness is what does the work and assists in the progress of all our activities,

while alertness is what observes the results of what we&#8217;ve done. To speak in terms of
the frames of reference, these qualities are called mindfulness and alertness. To speak
in terms of jhana, they&#8217;re called directed thought and evaluation. They&#8217;re the
qualities that give rise to discernment.
<!--l. 37969--><p class="indent" >   Discernment comes from observing causes and effects. If we know effects without
knowing causes, that doesn&#8217;t qualify as discernment. If we know causes without
knowing effects, that doesn&#8217;t qualify, either. We have to know both of them together
with our mindfulness and alertness. This is what qualifies as all-around knowing in
the full sense of the term.
<!--l. 37976--><p class="indent" >   The all-around knowing that arises within us comes from causes and effects, not
from what we read in books, hear other people tell us, or conjecture on our
own. Suppose we have some silver coins in our pocket. If all we know is
that other people tell us it&#8217;s money, we don&#8217;t know its qualities. But if we
experiment with it and put it in a smelter to see what it&#8217;s made of and to
see how it can be made into other things, that&#8217;s when we&#8217;ll know its true
qualities. This is the kind of knowledge that comes from our own actions. This
knowledge, when we meditate, comes in five forms. We find within ourselves
that some things are caused by the properties of the body, some are caused
by the mind, some causes come from the mind but have an effect on the
body, some causes come from the body but have an effect on the mind,
some causes come from the body and mind acting together. This kind of
knowledge is discernment. So we have to learn from virtue, concentration, and
discernment by giving rise to them. If we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll suffer from unawareness and
delusion.
<!--l. 37993--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness is what brings light to the mind, like a candle. If we take a
candle into a room at night, close the windows and doors, and fill in all
the cracks in the walls, no wind from outside will be able to slip in and
make the flame waver. The flame will give off even more light, and we&#8217;ll be
able to see everything in the room clearly. Closing the windows and doors
and filling in the cracks means exercising restraint over our eyes, ears, nose,
tongue, body, and mind, so that our attention doesn&#8217;t go straying out after
outside perceptions and preoccupations. This is called restraint through
mindfulness. Our mindfulness will gather into one. When mindfulness is
strong, the results are immediate: a sense of ease and mental well-being.
When mindfulness is solid and unflagging, our concentration will become
stronger. The mind will be still and upright. Light will arise in one of two
ways: from within ourself or from what&#8217;s reflected off the walls. This is why
mindfulness is the cause, the supporting factor, that keeps our concentration
progressing.
<!--l. 38010--><p class="indent" >   * * *
<!--l. 38012--><p class="indent" >   What does discernment come from? You might compare it with learning to
become a potter, a tailor, or a basket weaver. The teacher will start out by telling
you how to make a pot, sew a shirt or a pair of pants, or weave different patterns,
but the proportions and beauty of the object you make will have to depend on your
own powers of observation. Suppose you weave a basket and then take a good look at
its proportions, to see if it&#8217;s too short or too tall. If it&#8217;s too short, weave another one,

a little taller, and then take a good look at it to see if there&#8217;s anything that still
needs improving, to see if it&#8217;s too thin or too fat. Then weave another one,
better-looking than the last. Keep this up until you have one that&#8217;s as beautiful and
well-proportioned as possible, one with nothing to criticize from any angle. This
last basket you can take as your standard. You can now set yourself up in
business.
<!--l. 38027--><p class="indent" >   What you&#8217;ve done is to learn from your own actions. As for your previous efforts,
you needn&#8217;t concern yourself with them any longer. Throw them out. This is a
sense of discernment that arises of its own accord, an ingenuity and sense of
judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught you, but from
observing and evaluating on your own the object that you yourself have
made.
<!--l. 38034--><p class="indent" >   The same holds true in practicing meditation. For discernment to arise, you have
to be observant as you keep track of the breath and to gain a sense of how to adjust
and improve it so that it&#8217;s well-proportioned throughout the body &#8212; to the
point where it flows evenly without faltering, so that it&#8217; s comfortable in
slow and out slow, in fast and out fast, long, short, heavy, or refined. Get
so that both the in-breath and the out-breath are comfortable no matter
what way you breathe, so that &#8212; no matter when &#8212; you immediately feel a
sense of ease the moment you focus on the breath. When you can do this,
physical results will appear: a sense of ease and lightness, open and spacious.
The body will be strong, the breath and blood will flow unobstructed and
won&#8217;t form an opening for disease to step in. The body will be healthy and
awake.
<!--l. 38048--><p class="indent" >   As for the mind, when mindfulness and alertness are the causes, a still mind is the
result. When negligence is the cause, a mind distracted and restless is the result. So
we must try to make the causes good, in order to give rise to the good results we&#8217;ve
referred to. If we use our powers of observation and evaluation in caring for the
breath, and are constantly correcting and improving it, we&#8217;ll develop awareness on
our own, the fruit of having developed our concentration higher step by
step.
<!--l. 38057--><p class="indent" >   When the mind is focused with full circumspection, it can let go of concepts of
the past. It sees the true nature of its old preoccupations, that there&#8217;s nothing lasting
or certain about them. As for the future lying ahead of us, it&#8217;s like having to sail a
small boat across the great wide sea: There are bound to be dangers on all sides. So
the mind lets go of concepts of the future and comes into the present, seeing and
knowing the present.
<!--l. 38065--><p class="indent" >   The mind stands firm and doesn&#8217;t sway.Unawareness falls away.
<!--l. 38067--><p class="indent" >   Knowledge arises for an instant and then disappears, so that you can know that
there in the present is a void.
<!--l. 38070--><p class="indent" >   A void.
<!--l. 38072--><p class="indent" >   You don&#8217;t latch on to world-fashionings of the past, world-fashionings of the
future, or dhamma-fashionings of the present. Fashionings disappear. Avijja &#8212;
counterfeit, untrue awareness &#8212; disappears. &#8217;True&#8217; disappears. All that remains is
awareness: &#8217;buddha... buddha...&#8217;
<!--l. 38077--><p class="indent" >   The factor that fashions the body, i.e., the breath; the factors that fashion speech,

i.e., thoughts that formulate words; and the factor that fashions the mind, i.e.,
thinking, all disappear. But awareness doesn&#8217;t disappear. When the factor that
fashions the body moves, you&#8217;re aware of it. When the factor that fashions speech
moves, you&#8217;re aware of it. When the factor that fashions the mind moves, you&#8217;re
aware of it, but awareness isn&#8217;t attached to anything it knows. In other words, no
fashionings can affect it. There&#8217;s simply awareness. At a thought, the mind appears,
fashionings appear. If you want to use them, there they are. If not, they disappear on
their own, by their very nature. Awareness is above everything else. This is
release.
<!--l. 38089--><p class="indent" >   Meditators have to reach this sort of awareness if they&#8217;re to get good
results. In training the mind, this is all there is. Complications are a lot of
fuss and bother, and tend to bog down without ever getting to the real
point.
<!--l. 38094--><p class="indent" >   From Frames of Reference
<!--l. 38096--><p class="indent" >   In using the mind as a frame of reference, there are three aspects to deal
with:
<!--l. 38099--><p class="indent" >   A. The mind inside. B. The mind outside. C. The mind in and of itself.
<!--l. 38101--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;The mind inside&#8217; refers to a state exclusively in the heart when it isn&#8217;t involved
with any outer preoccupations. &#8217;The mind outside&#8217; refers to its interaction with such
outer preoccupations as sights, sounds, etc. &#8217;The mind in and of itself&#8217; refers to the
act of singling out any aspect of the mind as it appears, whether inside or
out.
<!--l. 38107--><p class="indent" >   As for the modes of the mind inside, there are three &#8212;
<!--l. 38109--><p class="indent" >   1. Raga-citta: a mental state infused with desire or passion. 2. Dosa-citta: a sense
of inner irritation and displeasure.
<!--l. 38112--><p class="indent" >   3. Moha-citta: a cloudy, murky or confused state of mind, in which it is unable to
consider anything; in short, delusion.
<!--l. 38115--><p class="indent" >   The mind outside is divided into the same three aspects &#8212; states of passion,
irritation and delusion &#8212; but these are said to be &#8217;outside&#8217; because once any of these
aspects arises, it tends to go out and latch onto an outer preoccupation that
simply serves to further aggravate the original state of passion, irritation or
delusion. The mind then doesn&#8217;t clearly or truly understand its objects. Its
knowledge goes off in various directions, away from the truth: seeing beauty,
for instance, in things that aren&#8217;t beautiful, constancy in things that are
inconstant, pleasure in things that are painful, and self in things that are
not-self.
<!--l. 38126--><p class="indent" >   All of these things are aspects of the mind outside.
<!--l. 38128--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;The mind in and of itself&#8217; refers to the act of singling out any one of these
aspects of the mind. For example, sometimes passion arises, sometimes anger,
sometimes delusion: Whichever aspect may be arising in the present, single it out.
With your alertness firmly in place, be mindful of that aspect of the mind, without
making reference to any other objects &#8212; and without letting any hopes or wants
arise in that particular mental moment at all. Then focus unwaveringly on
investigating that state of mind until you know its truth. The truth of these states is
that sometimes, once they&#8217;ve arisen, they flare up and spread; sometimes they die
away. Their nature is to arise for a moment and then dissolve away with nothing of

any substance or worth. When you are intent on examining things in this way &#8212;
with your mindfulness, alertness, and powers of focused investigation firmly in place
&#8212; then none of these defilements, even though they may be appearing, will have the
chance to grow or spread. This is like the baskets or jars used to cover new
lettuce plants: If no one removes the baskets, the plants will never have a
chance to grow, and will simply wither away and die. Thus you have to keep
your alertness right with each mental state as it arises. Keep mindfulness
constantly referring to its object, and use your powers of focused investigation to
burn into those defilements so as to keep them away from the heart at all
times.
<!--l. 38151--><p class="indent" >   To put this another way, all of the mental states mentioned above are like lettuce
or green-gram seeds. Mindfulness is like a basket. Alertness is the person who scatters
the seeds, while the power of focused investigation is the heat of the sun that burns
them up.
<!--l. 38156--><p class="indent" >   So far, we have mentioned only bad mental states. Their opposites are good
mental states: viraga-citta &#8212; the mind free from the grip of passion; adosa-citta &#8212;
the mind free from the annoyance or anger that can lead to loss and ruin;
amoha-citta &#8212; the mind free from delusion, intoxication and misunderstandings.
These are skillful states of mind (kusala-citta), which form the root of all that is
good. When they arise, maintain them and observe them so that you can come to
know the level of your mind.
<!--l. 38165--><p class="indent" >   There are four levels of good mental states &#8212;
<!--l. 38167--><p class="indent" >   1. Kamavacara-bhumi: the level of sensuality. 2. Rupavacara-bhumi: the level of
form.
<!--l. 38170--><p class="indent" >   3. Arupavacara-bhumi: the level of formlessness.
<!--l. 38172--><p class="indent" >   4. Lokuttara-bhumi: the transcendent level.
<!--l. 38174--><p class="indent" >   1. The level of sensuality: A mental state arises and connects with a wholesome
object &#8212; any sight, sound, smell, taste, tactile sensation or idea that can form the
basis for skillful mental states. When it meets with its object, it becomes happy,
joyful, and glad. (Here we&#8217;re referring only to those sensory objects that are good for
the mind.) If you were to refer to the Heavens of Sensual Bliss as they appear within
each of us, the list would run as follows: Sights that can form the basis for skillful
mental states are one level, sounds are another, and same with smells, tastes, tactile
sensations and ideas. Together they form the six levels of heaven on the sensual
level.
<!--l. 38186--><p class="indent" >   2. The level of form: A mental state arises from thinking about (vitakka)
a physical object that serves as the theme of one&#8217;s meditation; and then
analyzing (vicara) the object into its various aspects, at the same time making
sure that the mind doesn&#8217;t slip away from the object (ekaggatarammana).
When the mind and its object are one in this way, the object becomes light.
The mind is unburdened and can relax its sense of concern. Rapture (piti)
and ease (sukha) arise as a result. When these five factors appear in the
mind, it has entered the first jhana &#8212; the beginning stage in the level of
form.
<!--l. 38196--><p class="indent" >   3. The level of formlessness: The mind lets go of its physical object on the level
of form, but is still attached to a very subtle mental notion &#8212; the jhana

of unbounded space, for instance, in which you are focused on a sense of
emptiness and awareness with no physical object or image passing into your
field of attention, so that you are unable to know its full range. What has
actually happened is that you have curled up and are hiding inside. This isn&#8217;t
the kind of &#8217;going in to know&#8217; that comes from finishing your work. It&#8217;s
the &#8217;going in to know&#8217; that comes from wanting to run away. You&#8217;ve seen
the faults of what arises outside you, but haven&#8217;t seen that they really lie
buried within you &#8212; so you&#8217;ve hidden inside by limiting the field of your
attention.
<!--l. 38209--><p class="indent" >   Some people, when they reach this point, believe that they have done away with
defilement, because they mistake the emptiness for nibbana. Actually, it&#8217;s only
the first stage in the level of formlessness, and so is still on the mundane
level.
<!--l. 38214--><p class="indent" >   If you seriously want to know whether your mind is on the mundane or the
transcendent level, then observe it when you turn your awareness inward and make
it still &#8212; when you feel a sense of peace and ease that seems to have no
defilements adulterating it at all. Let go of that mental state, to see how it
behaves on its own. If defilements can reappear, you&#8217;re still on the mundane
level. Sometimes that mental state remains unchanged through the power of
your own efforts, but after a while you become unsure of your knowledge.
Your mind has to keep fondling, i.e., making a running commentary on it.
When this is the case, don&#8217;t go believing that your knowledge is in any way
true.
<!--l. 38226--><p class="indent" >   There are many, many kinds of knowledge: The intellect knows, the heart knows,
the mind knows, consciousness knows, discernment knows, alertness knows, awareness
knows, unawareness knows. All these modes are based on knowledge; they differ
simply in how they know. If you aren&#8217;t able to distinguish clearly among the different
modes of knowing, knowing can become confused &#8212; and so you might take wrong
knowing to be right knowing, or unawareness to be awareness, or knowledge attached
to suppositions (sammuti) to be freedom from suppositions (vimutti). Thus
you should experiment and examine things carefully from all angles so that
you can come to see for yourself which kind of knowledge is genuine, and
which is counterfeit. Counterfeit knowledge, merely knows, but can&#8217;t let go.
Genuine knowledge, when it goes about knowing anything, is bound to let
go.
<!--l. 38240--><p class="indent" >   All three levels of the mind discussed so far are on the mundane level.
<!--l. 38242--><p class="indent" >   4. The transcendent level: This begins with the path and fruition of entry into the
stream to nibbana. Those who reach this level have begun by following the threefold
training of virtue, concentration and discernment on the mundane level, but
then have gone on to gain their first true insight into the four Noble Truths,
enabling them to free themselves from the first three Fetters (sanyojana). Their
minds are thus released into the stream to nibbana. The three Fetters are
&#8212;
<!--l. 38251--><p class="indent" >   a. Self-identification (sakkaya-ditthi): the view that leads us to believe that the
body is our own. b. Doubt (vicikiccha): the uncertainty that leads us to be unsure of
the good we believe in &#8212; i.e., of how much truth there is to the Buddha, Dhamma

and Sangha.
<!--l. 38256--><p class="indent" >   c. Attachment to precepts and practices (silabbata-paramasa): fondling the good
that we practice; being attached to those forms of goodness that are merely external
&#8212; for instance, observing precepts or practices by clinging simply to the level of
bodily action or speech. Examples of this attitude include such things as developing
virtue by adhering simply to the precepts; practicing concentration by simply sitting
like a post; not being able to free yourself from these actions, always holding onto the
goodness that comes from them, happy when you have the chance to perform them in
a particular way, upset when you don&#8217;t; thinking, for instance, that virtue is
something you get from monks when they give you the precepts; that the
eight precepts are to be observed only on certain days and nights, months
and years; that you gain or lose merit simply as a result of external actions
associated with your accustomed beliefs. None of these attitudes reaches the
essence of virtue. They go no further than simply clinging to beliefs, customs,
and conventions; clutching onto these forms of goodness, always fondling
them, unable to let them go. Thus this is called &#8217;attachment to precepts and
practices.&#8217;
<!--l. 38275--><p class="indent" >   Such attitudes are an obstacle to what is truly good. Take, for example, the
long-held belief that goodness means to practice charity, virtue and meditation on
the sabbath days: stream-winners have completely let go of such beliefs. Their hearts
are no longer caught up in beliefs and customs. Their virtues no longer have precepts.
In other words, they have reached the essence of virtue. Their virtue is free
from the limits of time. In this they differ from ordinary, run-of-the-mill
people. Ordinary people have to hand goodness over to external criteria &#8212;
believing, for instance, that virtue lies on this day or that, during Rains Retreat,
during this or that month or year &#8212; and then holding fast to that belief,
maintaining that anyone who doesn&#8217;t follow the custom can&#8217;t be virtuous. In
the end, such people have a hard time finding the opportunity really to do
good. Thus we can say that they don&#8217;t know the true criteria for goodness.
As for stream-winners, all the qualities of virtue have come in and filled
their hearts. They are able to unshackle themselves from the conventional
values of the world that say that this or that is good. What is truly good
they have seen appear in their hearts. Good lies right here. Evil lies right
here. Neither depends on external actions. This is in line with the Buddha&#8217;s
saying,
<!--l. 38296--><p class="indent" >   mano-pubbangama dhammamano-settha mano-maya
<!--l. 38298--><p class="indent" >   All matters are preceded by the heart, Excelled by the heart, Achieved through
the heart.
<!--l. 38301--><p class="indent" >   This is what is meant by &#8217;stream-winner&#8217;.
<!--l. 38303--><p class="indent" >   Stream-winners are like people who have rowed their boats into the main current
of the Chao Phraya River, and so are destined to float down to the river&#8217;s mouth and
into the sea of amata &#8212; deathless &#8212; nibbana. There are three ways they can reach
the sea:
<!--l. 38309--><p class="indent" >   (1) The lowest level of stream-winner is like a boatsman who leans back with his
hand simply placed on the rudder. This level of stream-winner reaches the goal
slowly.

<!--l. 38313--><p class="indent" >   (2) The second level is like a boatsman who has his foot on the rudder, his hands
on the oars, and rows along.
<!--l. 38316--><p class="indent" >   (3) The third level: The boat is equipped with a motor and the boatsman is
at the steering wheel, and so he reaches the goal in practically no time at
all.
<!--l. 38320--><p class="indent" >   This &#8212; reaching the stream to nibbana &#8212; is the beginning stage of the
transcendent level. If you were to simplify the three Fetters, you could do so as
follows: To be attached to the body as being one&#8217;s own is self-identification. To be
attached to the actions of the body is attachment to precepts and practices. Not
knowing how to separate the mind from the body or from one&#8217;s actions makes
one unable to see clearly and know truly: This leads to uncertainty and
doubt.
<!--l. 38329--><p class="indent" >   These are simply my opinions on the matter, so you who read this should consider
things carefully on your own.
<!--l. 38332--><p class="indent" >   This ends the discussion of the transcendent and mundane skillful states of
mind.
<!--l. 38335--><p class="indent" >   When you know the characteristics of the various mental states, you should use
the three qualities mentioned above as your tools: Keep your mindfulness,
alertness, and powers of focused investigation firmly in place at the mind. To be
able to gain knowledge, you have to use the power of focused investigation,
which is an aspect of discernment, to know how mental states arise and fall:
pulling out, taking a stance, and then returning into stillness. You must keep
your attention fixed on investigating these things constantly in order to be
able to know the arising and falling away of mental states &#8212; and you will
come to know the nature of the mind that doesn&#8217;t arise and doesn&#8217;t fall
away.
<!--l. 38347--><p class="indent" >   To know the arising and falling away of mental states of the past is one level of
cognitive skill (vijja), and deserves to be called &#8217;knowledge of previous births.&#8217; To
know the states of the mind as they change in the present deserves to be called
&#8217;knowledge of death and rebirth.&#8217; To know how to separate mental states from their
objects, knowing the primal nature of the mind, knowing the current or force of the
mind that flows to its objects; separating the objects, the current of mind that flows,
and the primal nature of the mind: To be able to know in this way deserves to be
called &#8217;knowledge of the ending of mental effluents.&#8217; The objects or preoccupations of
the mind are the effluent of sensuality. The current that flows is the effluent of
becoming. Not knowing the primal nature of the mind is the effluent of
unawareness.
<!--l. 38361--><p class="indent" >   If we were to express this in terms of the four Noble Truths, we would have to do
so as follows: The objects or preoccupations of the mind are the truth of stress
(dukkha-sacca). The current of the mind that flows into and falls for its objects is the
truth of the cause of stress (samudaya-sacca). The mental state that penetrates in to
see clearly the truth of all objects, the current of the mind, and the primal nature of
the mind, is called the mental moment that forms the Path (magga-citta). To let
go of the objects, the mental current, and the primal nature of the mind,
without any sense of attachment, is the truth of the disbanding of stress
(nirodha-sacca).

<!--l. 38372--><p class="indent" >   When the three qualities that assist the mind &#8212; alertness, mindfulness, and
focused investigation &#8212; are vigorous and strong, alertness becomes the awareness of
release (vijja-vimutti), mindfulness becomes intuitive understanding (ñana), and
focused investigation becomes liberating insight (vipassana-ñana), the discernment
that can stay fixed on knowing the truth of stress without permitting any sense of
pleasure or displeasure for its object to arise. Intuitive understanding fathoms the
cause of stress, and the awareness of release knows the heart clearly all the
way through. When you can know in this way, you can say that you know
rightly.
<!--l. 38383--><p class="indent" >   Here I&#8217;d like to back up and discuss the question of the mind in a little more
detail. The word &#8217;mind&#8217; covers three aspects:
<!--l. 38386--><p class="indent" >   (1) The primal nature of the mind. (2) Mental states. (3) Mental states in
interaction with their objects.
<!--l. 38389--><p class="indent" >   All of these aspects, taken together, make up the mind. If you don&#8217;t know
the mind in this way, you can&#8217;t say that you really know it. All you can
do is say that the mind arises and falls away, the mind doesn&#8217;t rise or fall
away; the mind is good, the mind is evil; the mind becomes annihilated, the
mind doesn&#8217;t become annihilated; the mind is a dhamma, the mind isn&#8217;t a
dhamma; the mind gains release, the mind doesn&#8217;t gain release; the mind is
nibbana, the mind isn&#8217;t nibbana; the mind is sensory consciousness, the
mind isn&#8217;t sensory consciousness; the mind is the heart, the mind isn&#8217;t the
heart...
<!--l. 38399--><p class="indent" >   As the Buddha taught, there are only two paths to practice &#8212; the body, speech,
and heart; and the body, speech, and mind &#8212; and in the end both paths reach the
same point: Their true goal is release. So if you want to know the truth concerning
any of the above issues, you have to follow the path and reach the truth on your own.
Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have to argue endlessly. These issues &#8212; for people who
haven&#8217;t practiced all the way to clear insight &#8212; have been termed by people of
wisdom as sedamocana-katha: issues that can only make you break out in a
sweat.
<!--l. 38409--><p class="indent" >   So I would like to make a short explanation: The primal nature of the mind is a
nature that simply knows. The current that thinks and streams out from knowing to
various objects is a mental state. When this current connects with its objects
and falls for them, it becomes a defilement, darkening the mind: This is a
mental state in interaction. Mental states, by themselves and in interaction,
whether good or evil, have to arise, have to disband, have to dissolve away by
their very nature. The source of both these sorts of mental states is the
primal nature of the mind, which neither arises nor disbands. It is a fixed
phenomenon (thiti-dhamma), always in place. By the primal nature of the mind &#8212;
which is termed &#8217;pabhassara,&#8217; or radiant &#8212; I mean the ordinary, elementary
state of knowing in the present. But whoever isn&#8217;t able to penetrate in to
know it can&#8217;t gain any good from it, like the proverbial monkey with the
diamond.
<!--l. 38424--><p class="indent" >   Thus the name given by the Buddha for this state of affairs is really fitting: avijja
&#8212; dark knowledge, counterfeit knowledge. This is in line with the terms &#8217;pubbante
aññanam&#8217; &#8212; not knowing the beginning, i.e., the primal nature of the mind; &#8217;parante

aññanam&#8217; &#8212; not knowing the end, i.e., mental states in interaction with their
objects; &#8217;majjhantika aññanam&#8217; &#8212; not knowing the middle, i.e., the current that
streams from the primal nature of knowing. When this is the case, the mind becomes
a sankhara: a concoctor, a magician, fabricating prolifically in its myriad
ways.
<!--l. 38434--><p class="indent" >   This ends the discussion of the mind as a frame of reference.
<!--l. 38436--><p class="indent" >   From Basic Themes
<!--l. 38438--><p class="indent" >   IV. Mindfulness of Death: Insight Meditation
<!--l. 38440--><p class="indent" >   In other words, keep death in mind. This is where the mind advances to the
development of liberating insight, taking death as its theme. &#8217;Death&#8217; here refers to
the death occurring in the present &#8212; physical sensations arising and passing
away, mental acts arising and passing away, all in a moment of awareness.
Only when you&#8217;re aware on this level can you be classed as being mindful of
death.
<!--l. 38447--><p class="indent" >   Now that we&#8217;ve brought up the topic of death, we have to reflect on birth, seeing
how many ways sensations are born and how many ways mental acts are born. This
is something a person with a quiet mind can know.
<!--l. 38452--><p class="indent" >   A. Sensations have up to five levels of refinement &#8212;
<!--l. 38454--><p class="indent" >   1. Hina-rupa: coarse sensations, sensations of discomfort, aches and pains. When
these arise, focus on what causes them until they disappear. 2. Panita-rupa: exquisite
sensations that make the body feel pleasurable, light, and refined. Focus on what
causes them until they disappear...
<!--l. 38459--><p class="indent" >   3. Sukhumala-rupa: delicate sensations, tender, yielding, and agile. When they
arise, focus on what causes them until they disappear.
<!--l. 38462--><p class="indent" >   4. Olarika-rupa: physical sensations that give a sense of grandeur, exuberance,
brightness, and exultation: &#8217;Mukhavanno vipassidati.&#8217; When they arise, focus on
finding out what causes them until they disappear...
<!--l. 38467--><p class="indent" >   All four of these sensations arise and disband by their very nature; and it&#8217;s
possible to find out where they first appear.
<!--l. 38470--><p class="indent" >   5. &#8217;Mano-bhava&#8217;: imagined circumstances that appear through the power of the
mind. When they arise, focus on keeping track of them until they disappear. Once
you&#8217;re able to know in this way, you enter the sphere of true mindfulness of
death.
<!--l. 38475--><p class="indent" >   An explanation of this sort of sensation: When the mind is quiet and steadily
concentrated, it has the power to create images in the imagination (inner
sensations, or sensations within sensations). Whatever images it thinks of will
then appear to it; and once they appear, the mind tends to enter into them
and take up residence. (It can go great distances.) If the mind fastens onto
these sensations, it is said to take birth &#8212; simply because it has no sense of
death.
<!--l. 38483--><p class="indent" >   These sensations can appear in any of five ways: &#8212;
<!--l. 38485--><p class="indent" >   a. arising from the posture of the body, disappearing when the posture changes; b.
arising from thoughts imbued with greed, hatred, or delusion &#8212; arising, taking a
stance, and then disbanding;
<!--l. 38489--><p class="indent" >   c. arising with an in-breath and disbanding with the following out-breath;
<!--l. 38491--><p class="indent" >   d. arising from the cleansing of the blood in the lungs &#8212; appearing and

disbanding in a single instant;
<!--l. 38494--><p class="indent" >   e. arising from the heart&#8217;s pumping blood into the various parts of the body, the
pressure of the blood causing sensations to arise that correspond to sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, and tactile sensations. Sensations of this sort are arising and
disbanding every moment.
<!--l. 38499--><p class="indent" >   Another class of sensation is termed &#8217;gocara-rupa&#8217; &#8212; sensations that circle around
the physical body. There are five sorts &#8212; light, sound, smells, tastes, and tactile
sensations &#8212; each having five levels. For instance, common light travels slowly; in the
flash of an eye it runs for a league and then dies away. The second level, subtle light,
goes further; and the third level goes further still. The fourth and fifth levels can
travel the entire universe. The same holds true for sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile
sensations. The relationships between all the potentials in the universe are interacting
at every moment, differing only as to whether they&#8217;re fast or slow. This is the
inequality that has been termed &#8217;anicca-lakkhana&#8217; &#8212; inherent inconstancy.
Whoever is ignorant is bound to think that all this is impossible, but actually
this is the way things already are by their nature. We&#8217;ll come to know this
through vijja &#8212; cognitive skill &#8212; not through ordinary labels and concepts.
This is called true knowing, which meditators who develop the inner eye
will realize for themselves: knowing the arising of these sensations, their
persisting and their disbanding, in terms of their primary qualities and basic
regularity.
<!--l. 38519--><p class="indent" >   Knowing things for what they really are. Release, purity, dispassion, disbanding;
Nibbanam paramam sukham:
<!--l. 38522--><p class="indent" >   Nibbana is the ultimate ease.
<!--l. 38524--><p class="indent" >   B. As for mental acts that arise and die, their timespan is many thousands of
times faster than that of sensations. To be able to keep track of their arising and
dying away, our awareness has to be still. The four kinds of mental acts
are:
<!--l. 38529--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Vedana: the mind&#8217;s experience of feelings of pleasure, pain, and indifference. &#8212;
Sañña: recognizing and labeling the objects of the mind.
<!--l. 38533--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Sankhara: mental fabrications or fashionings of good and bad.
<!--l. 38536--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Viññana: distinct consciousness or cognizance of objects.
<!--l. 38538--><p class="indent" >   One class of these mental acts stays in place, arising and disbanding with
reference to the immediate present. Another class is termed &#8217;gocara vedana&#8217; &#8217;gocara
sañña,&#8217; etc., which go out to refer to the world. Each of these has five levels, differing
as to whether they&#8217;re common, refined, or subtle, slow or fast. These five
levels connect with each other, running out in stages, and then circling back
to their starting point, disbanding and then arising again &#8212; all without
end.
<!--l. 38547--><p class="indent" >   When we don&#8217;t have the skill to discern the primary sensations and mental acts
that stay in place, we can&#8217;t see into the &#8217;gocara&#8217; sensations and mental acts that go
flowing around. This is termed &#8217;avijja,&#8217; the unawareness that opens the way for
connecting consciousness (patisandhi viññana), giving rise to the act of fashioning
(sankhara), which is the essence of kamma. This gives fruit as sensations and
feelings that are followed by craving, and then the act of labeling, which gives
rise to another level of consciousness &#8212; of sensory objects &#8212; and then the

cycle goes circling on. This is termed the &#8217;khandha-vatta,&#8217; the cycle of the
aggregates, circling and changing unevenly and inconsistently. To see this is
called aniccanupassana-ñana, the knowledge that keeps track of inconstancy
as it occurs. This is known through the inner eye, i.e., the skill of genuine
discernment.
<!--l. 38561--><p class="indent" >   Thus, those who practice the exercises of insight meditation should use their
sensitivities and circumspection to the full if they hope to gain release from
unawareness. Fashionings, in this context, are like waves on the ocean. If we&#8217;re out in
a boat on the ocean when the waves are high, our vision is curtailed. Our senses of
hearing, smell, taste, touch, and ideation are all curtailed. We won&#8217;t be able to
perceive far into the distance. What this means is that when our minds are
immersed in the Hindrances, we won&#8217;t be able to perceive death at all. But
once we&#8217;ve been able to suppress the Hindrances, it&#8217;s like taking a boat
across the ocean when there are no waves. We&#8217;ll be able to see objects far
in the distance. Our eyes will be clear-seeing, our ears clear-hearing, our
senses of smell, taste, touch and ideation will be broad and wide open. The
water will be clear, and the light brilliant. We&#8217;ll be able to know all around
us.
<!--l. 38576--><p class="indent" >   In the same way, those who are to know death clearly have to begin by practicing
concentration as a foundation for developing liberating insight. How do the five sorts
of above-mentioned sensation arise? What are their causes? How do they disappear?
How do physical and mental feelings arise? How do they disappear? What are their
causes? How do labels and concepts arise? What are their causes? How do they
disappear? How do mental fashionings arise? What are their causes? How do
they disappear? How does consciousness arise by way of the senses of sight,
hearing, smell, taste, touch, and ideation? What are its causes? How does it
disappear?
<!--l. 38587--><p class="indent" >   Altogether there are four levels to each of the five aggregates (khandhas): external
and internal, staying in place and streaming outward. These can be known at all
times, but only people who have the discernment that comes from training the mind
in tranquillity and insight meditation will be able to know death on this
level.
<!--l. 38593--><p class="indent" >   The discernment that arises in this way has been termed &#8217;pubbenivas-anussati-ñana,
i.e., understanding past sensations, future sensations, and sensations in the present.
These sensations differ in the way they arise and pass away. To know this is to have
mastered one cognitive skill.
<!--l. 38598--><p class="indent" >   Cutupapata-ñana: With discernment of this sort, we&#8217;re able to keep track of the
states of our own mind as they arise and disappear, sometimes good as they arise and
good as they disappear, sometimes bad as they arise and bad as they disappear,
sometimes good as they arise and bad as they disappear, sometimes bad as they arise
and good as they disappear. To be able to keep track in this way is to know states of
being and birth.
<!--l. 38606--><p class="indent" >   Asavakkhaya-ñana: When the discernment of this skill arises, it leads to
disenchantment with the way sensations and mental acts arise and disappear and
then arise again, simply circling about: coarser sensations going through the cycle
slowly, more refined sensations going quickly; coarser mental acts going slowly, more

refined mental acts going quickly. When you can keep track of this, you know one
form of stress. Now focus attention back on your own mind to see whether or not it&#8217;s
neutral at that moment. If the mind approves of its knowledge or of the things it
knows, that&#8217;s kamasukhallikanuyoga &#8212; indulgence in pleasure. If the mind
disapproves of its knowledge or of the things it knows, that&#8217;s attakilamathanuyoga,
indulgence in self-infliction. Once you&#8217;ve seen this, make the mind neutral toward
whatever it may know: That moment of awareness is the mental state forming the
Path. When the Path arises, the causes of stress disband. Try your best to keep
that mental state going. Follow that train of awareness as much as you can.
The mind when it&#8217;s in that state is said to be developing the Path &#8212; and
at whatever moment the Path stands firm, disbanding and relinquishing
occur.
<!--l. 38625--><p class="indent" >   When you can do this, you reach the level where you know death clearly. People
who know death in this way are then able to reduce the number of their own deaths.
Some of the Noble Ones have seven more deaths ahead of them, some have only one
more, others go beyond death entirely. These Noble Ones are people who understand
birth and death, and for this reason have only a few deaths left to them. Ordinary
people who understand their own birth and death on this level are hard to find.
Common, ordinary birth and death aren&#8217;t especially necessary; but people who don&#8217;t
understand the Dhamma have to put up with birth and death as a common
thing.
<!--l. 38636--><p class="indent" >   So whoever is to know death on this level will have to develop the cognitive skill
that comes from training the mind. The skill, here, is knowing which preoccupations
of the mind are in the past, which are in the future, and which are in the present.
This is cognitive skill (vijja). Letting go of the past, letting go of the future,
letting go of the present, not latching onto anything at all: This is purity and
release.
<!--l. 38644--><p class="indent" >   As for unawareness, it&#8217;s the exact opposite: not knowing what&#8217;s past, not knowing
what&#8217;s future, not knowing what&#8217;s present &#8212; that is, the arising and falling away of
sensations and mental acts, or body and mind &#8212; or at most knowing only on the
level of labels and concepts remembered from what other people have said, not
knowing on the level of awareness that we&#8217;ve developed on our own. All of this is
classed as avijja, or unawareness.
<!--l. 38652--><p class="indent" >   No matter how much we may use words of wisdom and discernment, it still
won&#8217;t gain us release. For instance, we may know that things are inconstant,
but we still fall for inconstant things. We may know about things that are
stressful, but we still fall for them. We may know that things are not-self,
but we still fall for things that are not-self. Our knowledge of inconstancy,
stress, and not-self isn&#8217;t true. Then how are these things truly known? Like
this:
<!--l. 38660--><p class="indent" >   Knowing both sides,letting go both ways,shedding everything.
<!--l. 38662--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Knowing both sides&#8217; means knowing what&#8217;s constant and what&#8217;s inconstant,
what&#8217;s stress and what&#8217;s ease, what&#8217;s not-self and what&#8217;s self. &#8217;Letting go both ways&#8217;
means not latching onto things that are constant or inconstant, not latching onto
stress or ease, not latching onto self or not-self. &#8217;Shedding everything&#8217; means not
holding onto past, present, or future: Awareness doesn&#8217;t head forward or back, and

yet you can&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s taking a stance.
<!--l. 38670--><p class="indent" >   Yavadeva ñanamattaya patissatimattaya anissito ca viharatina ca kiñci loke
upadiyati.
<!--l. 38673--><p class="indent" >   &#8217;Simply mindful and aware, the mind remains independent, not attached to
anything in the world.&#8217;
<!--l. 38676--><p class="indent" >   From The Craft of the Heart
<!--l. 38678--><p class="indent" >   Now I would like to describe the virtues of the arahants, those who have gained
complete insight into the world, abandoning it once and for all. Though their
aggregates (physical and mental activities) may still appear to the world, they are
pure aggregates, absolutely free from both good and evil, because the mind doesn&#8217;t
claim possession of them. The mind is untouched by the behavior of the aggregates.
The ten fetters have been disbanded completely and no longer entangle the heart,
which is why this state is called nibbana: liberation. The mind is radiant and
clear; passion, aversion, and delusion can no longer cloud it. It has reached
the radiance of the primal nature of the heart, to which nothing else can
compare.
<!--l. 38690--><p class="indent" >   Once this radiance is realized, it obliterates the radiance of all three levels of
existence, so that no state of being appears at all. As long as the mind has yet
to gain release from defilement, it is bound to regard the three levels of
existence as radiant and appealing. Once the mind reaches stream-entry, the
radiance of the three levels of existence begins to darken and dim. When it
reaches the level of once-returning, that radiance appears even dimmer; and on
the level of non-returning, it appears dimmer yet, although it is still there.
When arahantship is reached, the radiance of the three levels of existence
is so dim that it has virtually vanished. When virtue, concentration, and
discernment are gathered at the mind, and unawareness disbands along
with the higher levels of the noble path, the world doesn&#8217;t appear at all.
You can&#8217;t tell what features, colors, or shapes it has, or even where it is.
There is only the pure brilliance of nibbana. All the worlds are dissolved
in the moments of the path and fruition of arahantship. This brilliance is
something always there, but we don&#8217;t see it because of our own darkness and
delusion.
<!--l. 38708--><p class="indent" >   This very brilliance, though, can obliterate the darkness of the world
so that only nibbana will appear. The radiance of nibbana obliterates the
radiance of the world just as the light of the sun, which illumines the world of
human beings and common animals, can obliterate at midday the light of the
stars appearing in the sky at night. Another comparison is the light of the
candle, which in the darkness appears bright to our eyes: If a burning kerosene
lantern is brought near the candle, the candle&#8217;s light will appear to dim. If the
lantern&#8217;s light is really brilliant, the light of the candle won&#8217;t even appear.
If we aren&#8217;t observant, we may think that the candle isn&#8217;t shedding any
light at all, but actually it&#8217;s giving off as much light as before, only now no
one pays it any attention. So it is with the mind that has reached radiant
nibbana, which obliterates the light of the sun and moon, and wipes from the
heart the glittering appeal of heaven and the Brahma worlds. This is why
nibbana is said to be zero or void: None of the three worlds appears as a

preoccupation of the heart; the heart no longer entangles itself. It zeroes
itself from the world, i.e., it no longer takes part in birth, aging, illness, and
death.
<!--l. 38727--><p class="indent" >   Nibbana is something genuine and unchanging. It knows nothing of deterioration.
It always stays as it is. As long as there is birth, aging, illness, and death, there will
always be nibbana, because birthlessness comes from birth, and deathlessness lies
buried in the very midst of dying. The problem, then, lies with those who don&#8217;t lay
the ground-work for realizing nibbana.Nibbana doesn&#8217;t vacillate back and forth, but
most people who practice virtue, concentration, and discernment do. Just like a man
who is going to walk to a city but, when he gets halfway there, turns back: Normally
he should reach the city in thirty days, but if he walks back and forth like this even
for three years, he&#8217;ll never get there. And when he doesn&#8217;t reach the city, if he were
then to go telling people that it doesn&#8217;t exist, he would be making a serious
mistake.
<!--l. 38741--><p class="indent" >   So it is with people who practice virtue, concentration, and discernment in half
measures, back and forth, and &#8212; when they don&#8217;t gain Awakening &#8212; go
telling others that nibbana is null and void, that the Buddha took it with
him when he died. This is very wrong. We can make a comparison with a
field where our parents have raised rice and always gotten a good crop. If
they die, and our own laziness fills their place so that we don&#8217;t do the work,
we&#8217;re bound to go hungry. And once we&#8217;re hungry, can we then say that
our parents took the rice or the field with them? In the same way, nibbana
is there, but if we don&#8217;t assemble the causes for realizing it and then go
denying its existence, you can imagine for yourself how much harm we&#8217;re
doing.
<!--l. 38754--><p class="indent" >   If we haven&#8217;t yet reached or realized nibbana, there&#8217;s nothing extraordinary about
it. But once we have come close to nibbana, the world will appear as if full of vipers
and masses of fire. The palaces and mansions of heavenly beings, if you can see them,
will look like the hovels of outcastes. You won&#8217;t be attracted to living in them,
because you&#8217;ve already known nibbana.
<!--l. 38761--><p class="indent" >   Nibbana is nothing else but this ordinary heart, freed from all the effluents of
defilement so that it reaches its primal nature. The primal nature of the heart is
something that doesn&#8217;t take birth, age, grow ill, or die. What takes birth is the act of
falling for preoccupations. The heart&#8217;s nature is clear and shining, but unawareness
keeps it clouded and opaque. Yet even on the physical level &#8212; to say nothing of the
heart &#8212; if someone were to come along and say that the water in the ocean is clear
by nature, that a person with any intelligence could see the ocean floor, you&#8217;d have a
hard time trying to find anyone to believe him. But what he says is true.
There are plenty of reasons why we can&#8217;t see the ocean floor &#8212; the dust and
minute particles floating in the water, the wind and the sea creatures that
interact with the water &#8212; but if you could get someone to eliminate these
factors so that there would be nothing but the nature of the water, it would
be crystal clear. You could tell at a glance how deep or shallow the ocean
was without having to waste your time diving and groping around. So it
is with the heart: If our hearts are still ignorant, we shouldn&#8217;t go groping
elsewhere for nibbana. Only if we cleanse our own hearts will we be able to see

it.
<!--l. 38782--><p class="indent" >   People who meditate are by and large extremely prone to conjecture and
speculation, judging nibbana to be like this or that, but actually there&#8217;s nothing
especially deep, dark, or mysterious about it. What makes nibbana seem mysterious
is our own lack of discernment. Nibbana is always present, along with the world. As
long as the world exists, there will always be nibbana. But if no one explores the
truth of nibbana, it will appear mysterious and far away. And once we give rise to our
own misunderstandings, we&#8217;re bound to start formulating notions that nibbana is like
this or like that. We may decide that nibbana is extinguished; that nibbana is null
and void; that nibbana has no birth, aging, illness, or death; that nibbana is
the self; or that nibbana is not-self. Actually, each of these expressions is
neither right nor wrong. Right and wrong belong to the person speaking,
because nibbana is something untouched by supposing. No matter what
anyone may call it, it simply stays as it is. If we were to call it heaven or
a Brahma world, it wouldn&#8217;t object, just as we suppose names for "sun"
and "moon": If we were to call them stars or clouds or worlds or jewels,
whatever they really are stays as it is; they aren&#8217;t transformed by our words.
At the same time, they themselves don&#8217;t announce that they are sun or
moon or anything. They are thiti-dhamma &#8212; they simply are what they
are.
<!--l. 38805--><p class="indent" >   So it is with the pure heart that we call nibbana. No matter what we call it, it
simply stays as it is. Thus we say that with nibbana there&#8217;s no right and no
wrong. Right and wrong belong to the person speaking. People who don&#8217;t
know drag out their right and wrong to talk about. Nibbana is something
known exclusively through the heart. Words and deeds aren&#8217;t involved. Our
talking is merely a matter of the path. The result, once attained, is something
completely apart. We thus call it release (vimutti) because it&#8217;s untouched by
supposing, attaining a nature that is pure heartwood: the heart that neither spins
forward nor back, the heart that attains a quality that doesn&#8217;t develop or
deteriorate, come or go. It stays as it is &#8212; what we suppose as thiti-dhamma, free
from the germs of defilement &#8212; our very own heart, i.e., the heart&#8217;s primal
nature.
<!--l. 38819--><p class="indent" >   Actually, the heart is pure by nature, but various moods and objects &#8212; various
preoccupations &#8212; are mixed up with it. Once these preoccupations are cleaned
out, there you are: nibbana. To know nibbana clearly is nothing other than
knowing how this one heart takes its preoccupations as itself. The heart by
nature is one, but if it hasn&#8217;t been trained by discernment, it tends to go
streaming toward preoccupations, both within and without, and then we say
that this state of mind differs from that state of mind, and so they begin to
multiply until they&#8217;re so many that we give up trying to look after them all.
They seem many because we count each preoccupation as a state of the
mind itself. The problem is that we don&#8217;t understand the teachings of the
ancient philosophers, and so think that the mind can be called many. Take
a simple example: Suppose a person has many jobs. Sometimes he sells,
so he&#8217;s called a merchant. If he also grows rice, he&#8217;s called a farmer. If he
works for the King, he&#8217;s called a government official. If he acquires rank, he&#8217;s

called by his rank. Actually he&#8217;s only one person, and none of his titles are
wrong. They&#8217;ve been given to him simply in line with the work he does. But
anyone who didn&#8217;t understand would think that this man was an awful lot of
people.
<!--l. 38840--><p class="indent" >   Another comparison: When a person is born, we call it a baby. When it gets
older, we call it a child. When it gets still older, we call it a young man or a young
lady, and when its hair gets gray and its teeth break, we call it Grandma or Gramps.
What gives rise to all these names? One and the same person. So it is with the mind
that is supposed to be many. We don&#8217;t understand what the words are supposed to
mean, so we go groping around after our own shadows. When this is the case, we find
it hard to practice. We don&#8217;t understand the states of mind that have been
supposed into being, and so don&#8217;t see the mind that is released, untouched by
supposing.
<!--l. 38851--><p class="indent" >   When the mind is said to have many states, this is what is meant: Sometimes the
mind takes on passion; this is called saraga-citta, a passionate mind. Sometimes it
takes on irritation and aversion; this is called sadosa-citta, an angry mind. Sometimes
it takes on a deluded state as itself; this is called samoha-citta, a deluded
mind. These states are all on the unwise side, and are termed akusala-citta,
unskillful mental states. As for the good side: vitaraga-citta, the mind has
reached satisfaction and so its desires fade; vitadosa-citta, the mind has had
enough and so its anger disappears; vitamoha-citta, the mind is bright and so
withdraws from its dullness, just as the sun or moon withdraws from an
eclipse and is bright and clear. These are termed kusala-citta, skillful mental
states.
<!--l. 38864--><p class="indent" >   Some people at this point think that there are six states to the mind, or even six
minds. The true nature of the mind, though, is one. To count six states or six
minds is to count the preoccupations; the primal mind is radiant. We take a
few things to be many and so end up poor, just as when a foolish or poor
person thinks that a thousand baht is a lot of money. An intelligent or rich
person, though, realizes that it&#8217;s just a little: You can spend it all in two days.
A fool, however, would think that a thousand baht would make him rich
and so he&#8217;ll have to continue being poor. So it is if we see our one mind as
many: We&#8217;ll have to be poor because we&#8217;ll be at our wits&#8217; end trying to train
it.
<!--l. 38876--><p class="indent" >   The nature of the mind that&#8217;s clear and one is like clean, clear water mixed with
different colors in different bottles. We may call it red water, yellow water, green
water, etc., but the water itself is still clear as it always was. If a fool comes along
and falls for the colors, he wants to taste them all. He may drink five bottles, but
they&#8217;ll all be just like the first. If he knows beforehand that it&#8217;s all the same water,
he won&#8217;t feel any desire to waste his time drinking this or that bottle. All
he has to do is taste one bottle, and that&#8217;ll be enough. So it is with the
mind: If we realize that the mind is in charge and is the determining factor
in all good and evil and in the attainment of nibbana, we won&#8217;t feel any
desire to go saying that the mind is like this or like that. The mind seems to
be many because it gets entangled in various preoccupations, and when
these preoccupations dye the mind, we count them as states of the mind

itself.
<!--l. 38891--><p class="indent" >   The pure nature of the heart and mind is like the sun, which shines every day
throughout the year but is concealed by clouds during the rainy season. Those who
don&#8217;t know its nature then say that the sun isn&#8217;t shining. This is wrong. Their vision
can&#8217;t penetrate the clouds and so they find fault with the sun. They suppose that the
darkness of the clouds belongs to the sun, get stuck on their own supposings, and so
don&#8217;t reach the truth. The true nature of the sun is always bright, no matter what
the season. If you don&#8217;t believe me, ask an airplane pilot. If you go up past the clouds
in an airplane on a dark rainy day, you&#8217;ll know whether the sun is in fact dark or
shining.
<!--l. 38902--><p class="indent" >   So it is with the mind: No matter how it may be behaving, its nature is
one &#8212; radiant and clear. If we lack discernment and skill, we let various
preoccupations come flowing into the mind, which lead it to act &#8212; sometimes
wisely and sometimes not &#8212; and then we designate the mind according to its
behavior.
<!--l. 38908--><p class="indent" >   Because there is one mind, it can have only one preoccupation. And if it has only
one preoccupation, then there shouldn&#8217;t be too much difficulty in practicing so as to
know its truth. Even though the mind may seem to have many preoccupations, they
don&#8217;t come all at once in a single instant. They have to pass by one at a time. A good
mood enters as a bad one leaves; pleasure enters, pain leaves; ingenuity enters,
stupidity, leaves; darkness enters, brightness leaves. They keep trading places
without let-up. Mental moments, though, are extremely fast. If we aren&#8217;t
discerning, we won&#8217;t be able to know our own preoccupations. Only after they&#8217;ve
flared up and spread to affect our words and deeds are we usually aware of
them.
<!--l. 38920--><p class="indent" >   Normally this one mind is very fast. Just as when we turn on a light: If we
don&#8217;t look carefully, the light seems to appear, and the darkness to disperse,
the very instant we turn on the switch. This one mind, when it changes
preoccupations, is that fast. This one mind is what leads to various states of being
because our preoccupations get into the act so that we&#8217;re entangled and
snared.
<!--l. 38927--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s not the case that one person will have many minds. Say that a person goes to
heaven: He goes just to heaven. Even if he is to go on to other levels of being, he has
to pass away from heaven first. It&#8217;s not the case that he&#8217;ll go to heaven, hell, and the
Brahma worlds all at the same time. This goes to show that the mind is one. Only its
thoughts and preoccupations change.
<!--l. 38934--><p class="indent" >   The preoccupations of the mind come down simply to physical and mental
phenomena that change, causing the mind to experience birth in various states of
being. Since the mind lacks discernment and doesn&#8217;t know the true nature of its
preoccupations, it gropes about, experiencing death and rebirth in the four
modes of generation (yoni). If the mind has the discernment to know its
preoccupations and let go of them all without remainder, leaving only the
primal nature of the heart that doesn&#8217;t fall for any preoccupation on the
levels of sensuality, form, or formlessness, it will be able to gain release from
suffering and stress. "Once the mind is fully matured by means of virtue,
concentration and discernment, it gains complete release from the effluents of

defilement."
<!--l. 38947--><p class="indent" >   Khandha-kamo &#8212; desire for the five aggregates is over and done with.
Bhava-kamo &#8212; desire for the three levels of being (the sensual plane, the plane of
form, and the plane of formlessness) disbands and disperses. The three levels of being
are essentially only two: the aggregate of physical phenomena, which includes the
properties of earth, water, fire, and wind; and the aggregates of mental phenomena,
which include feelings, labels, fashionings, and consciousness &#8212; in short, the
phenomena that appear in the body and heart or, if you will, the body and mind.
Physical phenomena are those that can be seen with the eye. Mental phenomena are
those that can&#8217;t be seen with the eye but can be sensed only through the heart and
mind. Once we can distinguish these factors and see how they&#8217;re related, we&#8217;ll come
to see the truth of the aggregates: They are stress, they are the cause of stress,
they are the path. Once we understand them correctly, we can deal with
them properly. Whether they arise, fade, or vanish, we won&#8217;t &#8212; if we have
any discernment &#8212; latch onto them with any false assumptions. The mind
will let go. It will simply know, neutral and undisturbed. It won&#8217;t feel any
need to worry about the conditions or behavior of the aggregates, because it
sees that the aggregates can&#8217;t be straightened out. Even the Buddha didn&#8217;t
straighten out the aggregates. He simply let them go, in line with their own true
nature.
<!--l. 38970--><p class="indent" >   The heart is what creates the substance of the aggregates. If you try to straighten
out the creations, you&#8217;ll never be done with them. If you straighten out the creator,
you&#8217;ll have the job finished in no time. When the heart is clouded with dullness and
darkness, it creates aggregates or physical and mental phenomena as its products,
to the point where the birth, aging, illness, and death of the aggregates
become absolutely incurable &#8212; unless we have the wisdom to leave them
alone in line with their own nature. In other words, we shouldn&#8217;t latch onto
them.
<!--l. 38980--><p class="indent" >   This is illustrated in the Canon, where the Buddha says in some passages that he
is free from birth, aging, illness, and death. If we read further, though, we&#8217;ll
notice that his body grew old, ill and then died; his mental activity ended.
This shows that the aggregates should be left alone. Whatever their nature
may be, don&#8217;t try to resist it or go against it. Keep your mind neutral and
aware. Don&#8217;t go latching onto the various preoccupations that arise, age,
grow ill, and vanish, as pertaining to the self. If you can do this, you&#8217;re
practicing correctly. Aim only at the purity of the one heart that doesn&#8217;t
die.
<!--l. 38990--><p class="indent" >   The heart clouded with dullness and darkness lacks a firm base and so drifts
along, taking after the aggregates. When they take birth, it thinks that it&#8217;s born;
when they age, it thinks that it&#8217;s aged; when they grow ill and disband, it gets mixed
up along with them and so experiences stress and pain, its punishment for drifting
along in the wake of its supposings.
<!--l. 38997--><p class="indent" >   If the mind doesn&#8217;t drift in this way, there is simply the disbanding of stress.
The cause of stress and the path disband as well, leaving only the nature
that doesn&#8217;t die: buddha, a mind that has bloomed and awakened. For the
mind to bloom, it needs the fertilizer of virtue and concentration. For it

to awaken and come to its senses, it needs discernment. The fertilizer of
concentration is composed of the exercises of tranquillity and insight meditation. The
mind then gains all-around discernment with regard to the aggregates &#8212;
seeing the pain and harm they bring &#8212; and so shakes itself free and keeps its
distance, which is why the term "arahant" is also translated as "one who is
distant." In other words, the mind has had enough. It has had its fill. It&#8217;s no
longer flammable, i.e., it offers no fuel to the fires of passion, aversion, and
delusion, which are now dispersed once and for all through the power of
discernment.
<!--l. 39013--><p class="indent" >   This is the supreme nibbana. Birth has been absolutely destroyed, but nibbana
isn&#8217;t annihilation. Nibbana is the name for what still remains: the primal heart. So
why isn&#8217;t it called the heart? Because it&#8217;s now a heart with no preoccupations.
Just as with the names we suppose for "tree" and "steel": If the tree is cut,
they call it "lumber." If it&#8217;s made into a house, they call it "home." If it&#8217;s
made into a place to sit, they call it a "chair." You never see anyone who
would still call it a "tree." The same with steel: Once it&#8217;s been made into a
car or a knife, we call it a "car" or a "knife." You never see anyone who
would still call it a "steel." But even though they don&#8217;t call it a steel, the
steel is still there. It hasn&#8217;t run off anywhere. It&#8217;s still steel just as it always
was.
<!--l. 39028--><p class="indent" >   So it is with the heart when the expert craftsman, discernment, has finished
training it: We call it nibbana. We don&#8217;t call it by its old name. When we no longer
call it the "heart," some people think that the heart vanishes, but actually it&#8217;s
simply the heart in its primal state that we call nibbana. Or, again it&#8217;s simply
the heart untouched by supposing. No matter what anyone may call it, it
simply stays as it is. It doesn&#8217;t take on anyone&#8217;s suppositions at all. Just as
when we correctly suppose a diamond to be a diamond: No matter what
anyone may call it, its real nature stays as it is. It doesn&#8217;t advertise itself as a
diamond. It simply is what it is. The same with the heart: Once it gains
release, it doesn&#8217;t suppose itself to be this or that. It&#8217;s still there. It hasn&#8217;t
been annihilated. Just as when we call a diamond a diamond, it&#8217;s there;
and when we don&#8217;t call it anything, it&#8217;s still there &#8212; it hasn&#8217;t vanished or
disappeared &#8212; so it is with the hear that is nibbana: It&#8217;s there. If we call it
a sun, a moon, heaven, Brahma world, earth, water, wind, fire, woman,
man, or anything at all, it&#8217;s still there, just as before. It hasn&#8217;t changed in
any way. It stays as it is: one heart, one Dhamma, free from the germs of
defilement.
<!--l. 39048--><p class="indent" >   This is why the truest name to suppose for it is release. What we call heart, mind,
intellect, form, feeling, labels, mental fashionings, consciousness: All these are
true as far as supposing goes. Wherever supposing is, there release can be
found. Take a blatant example: the five aggregates. If you look at their true
nature, you&#8217;ll see that they&#8217;ve never said, "Look. We&#8217;re aggregates," or "Look.
We&#8217;re the heart." So it is with the heart that&#8217;s nibbana, that has reached
nibbana: It won&#8217;t proclaim itself as this or that, which is why we suppose it
to be release. Once someone has truly reached release, that&#8217;s the end of
speaking.

<!--l. 39059--><p class="indent" >   From the Autobiography
<!--l. 39061--><p class="indent" >   I make it a practice to wander about during the dry season every year. I do this
because I feel that a monk who stays put in one monastery is like a train sitting still
at HuaLampong station &#8212; and everyone knows the worth of a train sitting still. So
there&#8217;s no way I could stay in one place. I&#8217;ll have to keep on the move all of my life,
as long as I&#8217;m still ordained.
<!--l. 39068--><p class="indent" >   Some of my companions have criticized me for being this way, and others have
praised me, but I myself feel that it brings nothing but good. I&#8217;ve learned about the
land, events, customs and religious practices in different areas. In some places it may
be that I&#8217;m more ignorant than the people there; in other places and with other
groups, it might be that I know more than they, so there&#8217;s no way I can lose by
traveling about. Even if I just sit still in the forest, I gain by it. Wherever I find the
people know less than I do, I can be their teacher. In whatever groups I find
that I know less than they do, I&#8217;m willing to be their student. Either way I
profit.
<!--l. 39079--><p class="indent" >   At the same time, living in the forest as I like to do has given me a lot to think
about. 1) It was a custom of the Buddha. He was born in the forest, attained
Awakening in the forest, and totally entered nibbana in the forest &#8212; and yet how was
he at the same time able to bring his virtues right into the middle of great
cities, as when he spread his religious work to include King Bimbisara of
Rajagaha.
<!--l. 39087--><p class="indent" >   2) As I see it, it&#8217;s better to evade than to fight. As long as I&#8217;m not superhuman,
as long as my skin can&#8217;t ward off knives, bullets and spears, I&#8217;d better not live in
the centers of human society. This is why I feel it&#8217;s better to evade than to
fight.
<!--l. 39092--><p class="indent" >   People who know how to evade have a saying: &#8217;To evade is wings; to avoid is a
tail.&#8217; This means: A tiny chick, fresh out of the egg, if it knows how to evade, won&#8217;t
die. It will have a chance to grow feathers and wings and be able to survive on
its own in the future. &#8217;To avoid is a tail&#8217;: This refers to the tail (rudder)
of a boat. If the person holding the rudder knows how to steer, he&#8217;ll be
able to avoid stumps and sand bars. For the boat to avoid running aground
depends on the rudder. Since this is the way I see things, I prefer living in the
forest.
<!--l. 39102--><p class="indent" >   3) I&#8217;ve come to consider the principles of nature: It&#8217;s a quiet place, where you can
observe the influences of the environment. Wild animals, for example, sleep
differently from domesticated animals. This can be a good lesson. Or take the wild
rooster: Its eyes are quick, its tail feathers sparse, its wings strong and its call short.
It can run fast and fly far. What do these characteristics come from? I&#8217;ve made this a
lesson for myself. Domesticated roosters and wild roosters come from the same
species, but the domesticated rooster&#8217;s wings are weak, its call long, its tail feathers
lush and ungainly, its behavior different from that of the wild rooster. The wild
rooster is the way it is because it can&#8217;t afford to let down its guard. It always
has to be on the alert, because danger is ever-present in the forest. If the
wild rooster went around acting like a domestic rooster, the cobras and
mongooses would make a meal of it in no time. So when it eats, sleeps, opens and
closes its eyes, the wild rooster has to be strong and resilient in order to stay

alive.
<!--l. 39119--><p class="indent" >   So it is with us. If we spend all our time wallowing around in companionship,
we&#8217;re like a knife or a hoe stuck down into the dirt: It&#8217;ll rust easily. But if it&#8217;s
constantly sharpened on a stone or a file, rust won&#8217;t have a chance to take hold. Thus
we should learn to be always on the alert. This is why I like to stay in the forest. I
benefit from it, and learn many lessons.
<!--l. 39126--><p class="indent" >   4) I&#8217;ve learned to reflect on the teachings that the Buddha taught first to each
newly-ordained monk. They&#8217;re very thought-provoking. He taught the Dhamma first,
and then the Vinaya. He&#8217;d begin with the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma and
Sangha, followed by the five basic objects of meditation: hair of the head, hair of
the body, nails, teeth and skin. Then he&#8217;d give a sermon with four major
points:
<!--l. 39133--><p class="indent" >   a) Make a practice of going out for alms. Be an asker, but not a beggar. Be
content with whatever you are given.
<!--l. 39136--><p class="indent" >   b) Live in a quiet place, such as an abandoned house, under a projecting cliff
face, in a cave. People have asked if the Buddha had any reasons for this
teaching, but I&#8217;ve always been convinced that if there were no benefits to
be gained from these places, he wouldn&#8217;t have recommended them. Still, I
wondered what the benefits were, which is why I&#8217;ve taken an interest in this
matter.
<!--l. 39143--><p class="indent" >   c) The Buddha taught monks to make robes from cloth that had been
thrown away &#8212; even to the point of wearing robes made from the cloth used
to wrap a corpse. This teaching made me reflect on death. What benefits
could come from wearing the cloth used to wrap a corpse? For a simple
answer, think for a moment about a corpse&#8217;s things: They don&#8217;t appeal to
anyone. No one wants them &#8212; and so they hold no dangers. In this point
it&#8217;s easy enough to see that the Buddha taught us not to take pride in our
possessions.
<!--l. 39152--><p class="indent" >   d) The Buddha taught that we should use medicines near at hand, such as
medicinal plants pickled in urine.
<!--l. 39155--><p class="indent" >   These teachings of the Buddha, when I first heard them, sparked my curiosity.
Whether or not I would benefit from following them, there was one thing I
was sure of: that the Buddha was not the sort of person who would hold
blindly to anything, and that he would never teach anything without good
reason. So even if I wasn&#8217;t totally convinced of his teachings, I should at least
respect them. Or if I didn&#8217;t yet have confidence in my teacher&#8217;s ability, I
owed it to him and to the traditions of the Sangha to give his teachings a
try.
<!--l. 39164--><p class="indent" >   I was reminded of the words of MahaKassapa, who asked to be allowed to follow
such ascetic practices as living in the forest, eating one meal a day (going out for
alms) and wearing robes made from thrown-away rags all of his life. The Buddha
questioned him, &#8217;You&#8217;ve already eradicated your defilements. What is there left for
you to strive for?&#8217;
<!--l. 39170--><p class="indent" >   MahaKassapa answered, &#8217;I want to observe these practices, not for my own sake,
but for the sake of those yet to come. If I don&#8217;t follow these practices, who will they
be able to take as an example? If a person teaches by example, the students will learn

easily, just as when a person teaches students how to read: If he has pictures to go
along with the text, the students will learn much more quickly. My observing these
practices is the same sort of thing.&#8217;
<!--l. 39178--><p class="indent" >   When I thought of these words, I felt sympathy for MahaKassapa, subjecting
himself to all sorts of hardships. If you were to put it in worldly terms, you could say
that he was already a multimillionaire, deserving a soft bed and fine food, but
instead he slept and ate on the ground, and had only coarse food to eat.
Thinking of his example, I&#8217;d be ashamed to look for nothing more than creature
comforts. As for MahaKassapa, he could have eaten fine food and lived in a
beautiful home with no danger of his heart&#8217;s being defiled. But &#8212; and it&#8217;s
not surprising &#8212; he was more concerned with benefiting those who came
after.
<!--l. 39189--><p class="indent" >   All of these things have given me food for thought ever since I was first
ordained.
<!--l. 39192--><p class="indent" >   Speaking of living in the forest, I&#8217;ve learned a lot of unusual lessons there.
Sometimes I&#8217;ve seen death close at hand and have learned a lot of lessons &#8212;
sometimes from seeing the behavior of animals, sometimes from talking to people
who live there.
<!--l. 39197--><p class="indent" >   Once there was an old man who told me of the time he had gone with his wife to
tap tree sap deep in a large forest. They happened to run into a bear, and a fight
ensued. The wife was able to get up a tree in time and then called down to her
husband, &#8217;If you can&#8217;t fight it off, lie down and play dead. Don&#8217;t make a
move.&#8217;
<!--l. 39203--><p class="indent" >   When her husband heard this, he came to his senses and so fell back on the
ground, lying absolutely still. Seeing this, the bear climbed up astride him, but then
let go of him and simply stood looking at him. The old man lay there on his back,
meditating on the word, &#8217;buddho, buddho,&#8217; and thinking, &#8217;I&#8217;m not going to
die. I&#8217;m not going to die.&#8217; The bear pulled at his legs and then at his head,
and then used its nuzzle to push him left and right. The old man kept his
joints loose and didn&#8217;t react in any way. After the bear had decided that the
man was dead, it left. A moment or so later the man got up and walked
home with his wife. His head was all battered and bloody, but he didn&#8217;t
die.
<!--l. 39215--><p class="indent" >   When he had finished telling me the story, he added, &#8217;That&#8217;s the way forest
animals have to be. If you can&#8217;t fight, you have to play dead.&#8217;
<!--l. 39218--><p class="indent" >   Hearing this, the thought occurred to me, &#8217;No one is interested in a dead person.
Since I live in the forest, I should play dead. Whoever praises me or attacks me, I&#8217;ll
have to be still &#8212; quiet in thought, word and deed &#8212; if I want to survive.&#8217; This can
also be a good reminder in the way of the Dhamma: To free yourself from death, you
have to play dead. This is a good lesson in maranassati, keeping death in
mind.
<!--l. 39226--><p class="indent" >   Another time, early one morning when I was staying in the middle of a large
forest, I took my followers out for alms. As we were going through the forest, I heard
a mother chicken cry, &#8217;Kataak! Kataak!&#8217; Since she didn&#8217;t fly away, I figured she
probably had some baby chicks, so I sent the boys to run and look. This
frightened the chicken and she flew away over the trees. The boys saw a lot of

baby chicks running around, but before they could catch them, the chicks
scurried into a large pile of fallen leaves. There they hid themselves and
lay absolutely still. The boys took a stick and stirred around in the leaves,
but the chicks didn&#8217;t move. They didn&#8217;t even make a peep. Although the
boys kept looking for a while, they couldn&#8217;t find even a single chick. I knew
that the chicks hadn&#8217;t gone anywhere. They had just pretended to be fallen
leaves. So as it turned out, of all those little tiny chicks, we couldn&#8217;t catch a
one.
<!--l. 39241--><p class="indent" >   Thinking about this, I was struck by their instincts for self-preservation, and how
clever they were: They simply kept themselves quiet in a pile of fallen leaves. And so
I made a comparison for myself: &#8217;When you&#8217;re in the wilds, then if you can keep your
mind still like the baby chicks, you&#8217;re sure to be safe and to free yourself from dying.&#8217;
This was another good lesson.
<!--l. 39248--><p class="indent" >   In addition to the animals, there are other aspects of nature &#8212; such as trees and
vines &#8212; that can set you thinking. Take vines, for instance. There are some that
don&#8217;t turn in any direction but right. Observing this, I&#8217;ve made it a lesson for myself.
&#8217;If you&#8217;re going to take your mind to the highest good, you&#8217;ll have to act like
the vines: i.e., always to the right, for the Buddha taught, &#8217;Kaya-kammam,
vaca-kammam, mano-kammam padakkhinam&#8217; &#8212; going to the right in thought, word
and deed. You&#8217;ll always have to go right &#8212; by keeping yourself above the defilements
that flare up and consume the heart. Otherwise you&#8217;ll be no match even for a
vine.&#8217;
<!--l. 39259--><p class="indent" >   Some kind of trees make themselves quiet in ways we can see: We say that they
&#8217;sleep.&#8217; At night, they fold up their leaves. If you go lie under them, you&#8217;ll have a
clear view of the stars in the nighttime sky. But when day comes, they&#8217;ll spread out
their leaves and give a dense shade. This is a good lesson for the mind: When you
sit in meditation, close only your eyes. Keep your mind bright and alert,
like a tree that closes its leaves and thus doesn&#8217;t obstruct our view of the
stars.
<!--l. 39268--><p class="indent" >   When you can think in this way you see the value of living in the forest.
The mind becomes confident. Dhamma that you have studied &#8212; or even
that you haven&#8217;t &#8212; will make itself clear because nature is the teacher.
It&#8217;s like the sciences of the world, which every country has used to develop
amazing powers. None of their inventions or discoveries came out of a textbook.
They came because scientists studied the principles of nature, all of which
appear right here in the world. As for the Dhamma, it&#8217;s just like science: It
exists in nature. When I realized this I no longer worried about studying
the scriptures, and I was reminded of the Buddha and his disciples: They
studied and learned from the principles of nature. None of them followed a
textbook.
<!--l. 39281--><p class="indent" >   For these reasons I&#8217;m willing to be ignorant when it comes to texts and scriptures.
Some kinds of trees sleep at night and are awake during the day. Others sleep by day
and are awake by night. The same is true of forest animals.
<!--l. 39286--><p class="indent" >   Living in the forest, you also learn from the vapors that each plant exudes. Some
plants are good for your health, some are bad. Sometimes, for example,
when I&#8217;ve been feverish, I&#8217;ve gone to sit under certain kinds of trees and my

fever has disappeared. Sometimes when I&#8217;ve been feeling well I&#8217;ve gone to
sit under certain kinds of trees and the elements in my body have become
disturbed. Sometimes I&#8217;ve been hungry and thirsty, but as soon as I go sit under
certain kinds of trees, my hunger and thirst disappear. Learning from trees in
this way has caused me to think about the traditional doctors who keep
a statue of a hermit on their altars. Those hermits never studied medical
textbooks, but were able to teach about medicines that can cure disease
because they had studied nature by training their minds the same way we
do.
<!--l. 39299--><p class="indent" >   Similar lessons can be learned from water, earth and air. Realizing this, I&#8217;ve never
gotten very excited about medicines that cure disease, because I feel that good
medicines are everywhere. The important point is whether or not we recognize them,
and this depends on us.
<!--l. 39304--><p class="indent" >   In addition, there&#8217;s another quality we need in order to take care of ourselves: the
power of the mind. If we&#8217;re able to keep the mind quiet, its ability to cure disease will
be tens of times greater than that of any medicine. This is called dhamma-osatha: the
medicine of the Dhamma.
<!--l. 39310--><p class="indent" >   All in all, I can really see that I&#8217;ve gained from living in forests and other quiet
places in order to train the mind. One by one I&#8217;ve been able to cut away my doubts
about the Buddha&#8217;s teachings. And so, for this reason, I&#8217;m willing to devote
myself to the duties of meditation until there&#8217;s no more life left for me to
live.
<!--l. 39316--><p class="indent" >   The gains that come from training the mind, if I were to describe them
in detail, would go on and on, but I&#8217;ll ask to finish this short description
here.
