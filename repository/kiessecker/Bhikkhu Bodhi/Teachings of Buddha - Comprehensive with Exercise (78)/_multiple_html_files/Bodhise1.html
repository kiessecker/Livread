<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   1. Life means suffering.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   To live means to suffer, because the human nature is not perfect and neither is
the world we live in. During our lifetime, we inevitably have to endure physical
suffering such as pain, sickness, injury, tiredness, old age, and eventually death;
and we have to endure psychological suffering like sadness, fear, frustration,
disappointment, and depression. Although there are different degrees of suffering and
there are also positive experiences in life that we perceive as the opposite of
suffering, such as ease, comfort and happiness, life in its totality is imperfect and
incomplete, because our world is subject to impermanence. This means we
are never able to keep permanently what we strive for, and just as happy
moments pass by, we ourselves and our loved ones will pass away one day,
too.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   2. The origin of suffering is attachment.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance
thereof. Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us,
but also ideas, and -in a greater sense- all objects of our perception. Ignorance is the
lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanent things. The
reasons for suffering are desire, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth and prestige,
striving for fame and popularity, or in short: craving and clinging. Because the
objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will
necessarily follow. Objects of attachment also include the idea of a "self" which is a
delusion, because there is no abiding self. What we call "self" is just an
imagined entity, and we are merely a part of the ceaseless becoming of the
universe.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   3. The cessation of suffering is attainable.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   The cessation of suffering can be attained through nirodha. Nirodha means the
unmaking of sensual craving and conceptual attachment. The third noble truth
expresses the idea that suffering can be ended by attaining dispassion. Nirodha
extinguishes all forms of clinging and attachment. This means that suffering can be
overcome through human activity, simply by removing the cause of suffering.
Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results
in the state of Nirvana. Nirvana means freedom from all worries, troubles, complexes,
fabrications and ideas. Nirvana is not comprehensible for those who have not attained
it.

<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   4. The path to the cessation of suffering.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   There is a path to the end of suffering - a gradual path of self-improvement,
which is described more detailed in the Eightfold Path. It is the middle way
between the two extremes of excessive self-indulgence (hedonism) and excessive
self-mortification (asceticism); and it leads to the end of the cycle of rebirth. The
latter quality discerns it from other paths which are merely "wandering on the wheel
of becoming", because these do not have a final object. The path to the
end of suffering can extend over many lifetimes, throughout which every
individual rebirth is subject to karmic conditioning. Craving, ignorance,
delusions, and its effects will disappear gradually, as progress is made on the
path.
