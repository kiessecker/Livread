<!--l. 70880--><p class="noindent" >The wheel of life, or "samsara", is an ancient symbol that has the same meaning
in Buddhism and Hinduism. It is symbolises the cycle of birth, life, and
death. When one revolution of the wheel is completed, life begins again with
rebirth.
<!--l. 70885--><p class="indent" >   What is karma?
<!--l. 70887--><p class="indent" >   Karma is a Sanskrit word that literally means "action". The word is used to
refer to volitional acts as well as the forces that arise from these acts. The
idea of karma had existed in ancient Indian philosophy before the time of
Siddhartha Gautama, and it became an important element of Buddhist
philosophy.
<!--l. 70893--><p class="indent" >   The Hindu and Buddhist concepts of karma are quite similar, although Hinduism
makes a further distinction between different types of karma, such as present
karma, latent karma, and future karma. In the understanding of both thought
systems, the law of karma describes the connection between actions and the
resulting forces, as follows: wholesome actions lead to wholesome states while
unwholesome actions lead to unwholesome states, individually as well as
collectively.
<!--l. 70901--><p class="indent" >   The ethical dimension.
<!--l. 70903--><p class="indent" >   To make this more intelligible, one has to account for (un)wholesome actions and
(un)wholesome states and their respective meaning in Buddhism. The former is
outlined in the Noble Eightfold Path. Action springs from volition, which springs
from intention, which springs from thought, and so forth. The quality of actions can
be described in ethical terms, simply as either good or bad, or both good and bad, or
indifferent.
<!--l. 70910--><p class="indent" >   There are various grades of ethical qualities; and most people have an intuitive
understanding that enables them to discern between good and bad, although the
discerning ability depends on the person&#8217;s state of mental development. A wise
person at a high level of mental development can clearly discern mental activities and
actions in an ethical dimension, while a deluded person has difficulties or is even
unable to do so.
<!--l. 70917--><p class="indent" >   Good and bad vs. skilful and unskilful.
<!--l. 70919--><p class="indent" >   Wherever the three defilements - delusion, greed, and aversion - are present, they
blur the view and increase the level of confusion in the individual or group.
Consequently, if the defilements are present, there is a low level of skill in
distinguishing between good and bad actions. Thus it makes sense to say that we
have skilful (good) and unskilful (bad) thoughts, we speak skilful (good) and
unskilful (bad) words, and we act either in a skilful (good) or in an unskilful (bad)
way.

<!--l. 70928--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhist Precepts and the Ten Perfections give concrete meaning to
good and bad and explain skilful and unskilful volitional acts in detail. Since
everything in Buddhism is interrelated, the Eightfold Path must be seen in
connection with the Four Noble Truths, the concept of karma, and the tenet of
rebirth.
<!--l. 70934--><p class="indent" >   Moral quality of volitional acts determines karma.
<!--l. 70936--><p class="indent" >   The law of karma states that there is a connection between the moral quality, the
level of skill in volitional actions, and the resulting states. What we are is
determined largely by what we thought, said and did in the past, while what
we are thinking, saying, and doing now will form our future. The karma
of past, present, and future events are connected by the law of cause and
effect.
<!--l. 70943--><p class="indent" >   For instance, if one generates bad karma by hurting or killing sentient beings, one
will have to endure the negative consequences of these deeds in this or another
lifetime. Similarly, if one generates good karma by observing the precepts, positive
consequences will follow inevitably.
<!--l. 70949--><p class="indent" >   Buddhists understand karma as a natural law. There is no higher instance, no
judgement, no divine intervention, and no gods that steer man&#8217;s destiny, but only the
law of karma itself, which works on a global time frame. Deeds yield consequences
either in the next second, in the next hour, day, month, year, decade, or even in the
next lifetime, or in another distant lifetime. To illustrate this, consider the following
example describing a sequence of volitional acts, which yield instant karmic
results:
<!--l. 70958--><p class="indent" >   Example: The arising of volition and karma.
<!--l. 70960--><p class="indent" >   An unpleasant sensation occurs. A thought arises that the source of the
unpleasantness was a person. This thought is a delusion; any decisions based upon it
will therefore be unskilful. A thought arises that some past sensations of
unpleasantness issued from this same person. This thought is a further delusion. This
is followed by a wilful decision to speak words that will produce an unpleasant
sensation in that which is perceived as a person. This decision is an act of
hostility.
<!--l. 70968--><p class="indent" >   Of all the events described so far, only this is called karma. Words are
carefully chosen in the hopes that when heard they will cause pain. The
words are pronounced aloud. This is the execution of the decision to be
hostile. It may also be classed as a kind of karma, although technically it is
after-karma.
<!--l. 70974--><p class="indent" >   There is a visual sensation of a furrowed brow and turned down mouth. The
thought arises that the other person&#8217;s face is frowning. The thought arises that the
other person&#8217;s feelings were hurt. There is a fleeting joyful feeling of success in
knowing that one has scored a damaging verbal blow.
<!--l. 70980--><p class="indent" >   Eventually, perhaps much later, there is an unpleasant sensation of regret,
perhaps taking the form of a sensation of fear that the perceived enemy may
retaliate, or perhaps taking the form of remorse on having acted impetuously, like an
immature child, and hoping that no one will remember this childish action. This
regret or fear is the unpleasant ripening of the karma, the unskilful decision to inflict
pain through words.

<!--l. 70988--><p class="indent" >   Rebirth.
<!--l. 70990--><p class="indent" >   Buddhists hold that the retributive process of karma can span more than one
lifetime. Rebirth, or reincarnation, has always been an important tenet in Buddhism;
and it is often referred to as walking the wheel of life (samsara). It is the process of
being born over and over again in different times and different situations, possibly for
many thousand times.
<!--l. 70997--><p class="indent" >   As long as there is delusion, greed, and aversion, and as long as passions are not
extinguished, we generate karma. Because we eventually accumulate unmaterialised
karma in this or in a past lifetime, there is a next lifetime in which the accumulated
karma will take form. Only when all accumulated karma is realised and the
generation of new karma is calmed, one can enter the stream that leads to Nirvana.
This process continues until Nirvana is reached, which signifies the cessation of
rebirth and, hence, suffering.
<!--l. 71006--><p class="indent" >   It is notable that this also entails the avoidance of "good karma". Once the
stream that leads to Nirvana is entered, creating wholesome karma is not an object
anymore. Although wholesome karma leads to entering the stream, it does not
necessarily lead to Nirvana, only the extinguishment of all karmic forces will lead to
Nirvana.
<!--l. 71013--><p class="indent" >   The Non-Self.
<!--l. 71015--><p class="indent" >   The concept of rebirth is unfamiliar to most Western people. Its philosophical and
traditional foundation is found in India, where the theory of transmigration of souls
had presumably existed long before it was written down in the Upanishads around
300 BC.
<!--l. 71020--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhist concept is subtly different from the classical Indian understanding,
because it denies the existence of a self. In Buddhism, the idea of self is merely an
illusion. Man wrongly identifies perception, consciousness, mind and body with what
he calls self. In reality there is no abiding entity that could be identified with a
self, because the states of perception, consciousness, and mind constantly
change.
<!--l. 71027--><p class="indent" >   The body is mortal and when it dies, consciousness and all mental activities
cease. That is why there is no soul. The idea of soul is simply an extension of the self.
Soul is the immortal version of the self that supposedly survives physical death. Since
we know that consciousness is a function of our nervous system, it seems difficult to
believe that the conscious self survives death. Hence, Buddhists deny the reality of
both self and soul.
<!--l. 71035--><p class="indent" >   The idea of an abiding self is deceptive, because it is derived from unenlightened
reasoning. The word self simply provides a reference frame for the mind-body
phenomena of sentient beings. We usually identify it with our body and the stream of
consciousness induced by sense perceptions and thoughts. In reality, what we call self
is neither abiding nor detached from the rest of the world and other beings.
Buddhists call this the "neither self nor non-self".
<!--l. 71043--><p class="indent" >   What is reborn if not the "self"?
<!--l. 71045--><p class="indent" >   If the idea of non-self sounds odd, then it must sound even more curious that
non-self can be reborn. There is a seeming contradiction between the canon of rebirth
and that of the non-self, which even many dedicated Buddhists find difficult to
understand. The contradiction is, however, only on the surface and can be solved if

one pictures the self as the result of karmic formation. This can be put into less
abstract words:
<!--l. 71053--><p class="indent" >   If we imagine the world as an ocean, we are like the ripples on the ocean.
Formations like ripples and waves occur, because of wind, tides, and other kinetic
forces. In the Buddhist analogy, the universe is in motion due to karmic forces. A
ripple, a wave, or a billow may seem as an individual entity for a moment, creating
the illusion that it has a self, but it is gone in the next moment. The truth is that all
individuals are one. A ripple is a temporary phenomenon; it is just water
in motion. We know that kinetic energy causes wave forms on a body of
water and it would be ridiculous to say that a single ripple or wave has a
self.
<!--l. 71064--><p class="indent" >   Similarly, in case of beings, the process of coming into life and being conditioned
in a particular way is caused by karmic forces. The up and down of the
ocean&#8217;s waves corresponds with the rotation of the wheel of life. The sea
that surges, falls, and resurges, is the life that is born, dies, and is reborn
again. It is therefore obvious that we should not focus on the temporary
phenomenon of the wave, but on the force that causes, forms, and drives
it. Nothing else is said, although in more practical terms, in the Eightfold
Path.
