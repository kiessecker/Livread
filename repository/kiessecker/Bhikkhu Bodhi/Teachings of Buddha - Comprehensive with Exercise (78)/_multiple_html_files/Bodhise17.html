<!--l. 56854--><p class="indent" >   The recent upsurge of interest in Buddhism, both East and West, has
been marked by a vigorous practical orientation and a drive to discover
the peace and freedom to which the practice of Dhamma leads. This zeal
for practice, however, has often been accompanied by another trait which
may not be so fruitful, namely, a tendency to neglect or even belittle the
methodical study of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings. The arguments offered in defense of
this attitude have already become familiar currency among us. It is said,
for example, that study is concerned with words and concepts, not with
realities; that it leads only to learning, not to wisdom; that it can change only
our ideas but fails to touch us at the deeper levels of our lives. To clinch
the case the testimony of the Buddha himself is enlisted, with his famous
remarks that to learn much without practicing is like counting the cows of
others or like carrying a raft on one&#8217;s head instead of using it to cross the
stream.
<!--l. 56870--><p class="indent" >   This contention, to be sure, has its aspect of truth, but also suffers from a
one-sided emphasis which may actually thwart rather than aid our progress on the
Buddhist path. It is certainly true that learning without practice is fruitless, but the
other side of the issue also should be considered. Should a person gather cows if he
knows nothing about how to take care of them? Should he try to cross a
rough and dangerous river without knowing how to operate a raft? The
Buddha himself insisted that his followers learn and transmit the Dhamma
both in the letter and the spirit, but rather than appealing to traditional
formulations, let us inquire ourselves into the value and function of Dhamma
study.
<!--l. 56882--><p class="indent" >   The point at issue, it must be stressed, is not study as an academic discipline or
the accumulation of a wealth of learning, but the acquisition of a sound and solid
working knowledge of the basic Buddhist doctrines. Now to see why this is so
essential, we must recall that the entire practice of the proper Buddhist path
develops out of the act through which we enter the path &#8212; the going for refuge to
the Triple Gem. If we have taken this step honestly, with correct motivation, it
implies that we have acknowledged our need for spiritual guidance and have
entrusted ourselves to the Buddha as our guide and to his teaching as our vehicle of
guidance. By taking refuge in the Dhamma we accept not merely a technique of
meditation that we can use at liberty for our own self-appointed purposes, but a
profound and comprehensive teaching on the true nature of the human condition, a

teaching designed to awaken in us a perception of this truth as the means for
reaching the full and final end of suffering. The liberation offered by the Dhamma
comes, not from simply practicing meditation in the context of our own
preconceptions and desires, but from practicing upon the groundwork of
the right understanding and right intentions communicated to us by the
Buddha.
<!--l. 56902--><p class="indent" >   This cognitive character of the Buddhist path elevates doctrinal study and
intellectual inquiry to a position of great importance. Though the knowledge that
frees the mind from bondage emerges only from intuitive insight and not from a mass
of doctrinal facts, genuine insight always develops on the basis of a preliminary
conceptual grasp of the basic principles essential to right understanding, in the
absence of which its growth will inevitably be obstructed. The study and systematic
reflection through which we arrive at this preparatory right view necessarily involve
concepts and ideas. But before we hasten to dismiss Dhamma study as being
therefore only a worthless tangle of verbiage, let us consider that concepts and ideas
are our indispensable tools of understanding and communication. Concepts,
however, can be valid and invalid tools of understanding; ideas can be fruitful
or useless, capable of bringing immense benefit or of entailing enormous
harm. The object of studying the Dhamma as part of our spiritual quest is
to learn to comprehend our experience correctly: to be able to distinguish
the valid from the invalid, the true from the false, the wholesome from the
unwholesome.
<!--l. 56921--><p class="indent" >   It is only by making a thorough and careful investigation that we will be in a
position to reject what is detrimental to our growth and to apply ourselves with
confidence to cultivating what is truly beneficial. Without having reached this
preliminary conceptual clarification, without having succeeded in "straightening out
our views," there can indeed be the earnest practice of Buddhist meditation
techniques, but there will not be the practice of the meditation pertaining to the
integral Noble Eightfold Path. And while such free-based meditation may
bring its practitioners the mundane benefits of greater calm, awareness and
equanimity, lacking the guidance of right view and the driving power of
right motivation, it is questionable whether it can lead to the penetrative
realization of the Dhamma, or to its final goal, the complete cessation of
suffering.
<!--l. 56935--><p class="indent" >   It is almost impossible to give a single word of counsel on the subject of study
applicable to all followers of the Dhamma. Needs and interests vary so greatly from
one person to another that each will have to strike the balance between study and
practice that suits his or her own disposition. But without hesitation it can be said
that all who earnestly endeavor to live by the Buddha&#8217;s teaching will find their
practice strengthened by the methodical study of his Dhamma. Such an undertaking,
of course, will not be easy, but it is just through facing and surmounting the
challenges we meet that our understanding will ripen and mature in the higher
wisdom.
<!--l. 56946--><p class="indent" >   Publisher&#8217;s note
<!--l. 56948--><p class="indent" >   The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making
known the Teaching of the Buddha, which has a vital message for people of all

creeds.
<!--l. 56952--><p class="indent" >   Founded in 1958, the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets
covering a great range of topics. Its publications include accurate annotated
translations of the Buddha&#8217;s discourses, standard reference works, as well as original
contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice. These works present
Buddhism as it truly is &#8212; a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds
for the past 2500 years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first
arose.
