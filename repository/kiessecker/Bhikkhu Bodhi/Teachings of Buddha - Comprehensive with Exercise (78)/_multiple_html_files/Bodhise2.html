<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >The Eight-Fold Path is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths - the first of the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings. All the teachings flow from this foundation.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   The Four Noble Truths are
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   1. The Noble Truth of the reality of Dukkha as part of conditioned existence.Dukkha
is a multi-faceted word. Its literal meaning is "that which is difficult to bear". It can
mean suffering, stress, pain, anguish, affliction or unsatisfactoriness. Each of the
English words is either too strong or too weak in their meaning to be a universally
successful translation. Dukkha can be gross or very subtle. From extreme
physical and mental pain and torment to subtle inner conflicts and existential
malaise.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   2. The Noble Truth that Dukkha has a causal arising.This cause is defined as
grasping and clinging or aversion. On one hand it is trying to control anything and
everything by grabbing onto or trying to pin them down, On the other hand it is
control by pushing away or pushing down and running away or flinching away
from things. It is the process of identification through which we try to make
internal and external things and experiences into "me and mine" or wholly
&#8217;"other" than Me. This flies in the face of the three signs of existence - Anicca,
Dukkha. Anatta - Impermanence. Stress or Suffering and No-Self. Because all
conditioned existence is impermanent it gives rise to Dukkha, and this means
that in conditioned existence there is no unchanging and permanent Self.
There is nothing to grasp onto and also in reality, nothing or no &#8217;one&#8217; to do
the grasping! We grab onto or try to push away ever changing dynamic
processes. These attempts to control, limit us to little definitions of who we
are.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   3. The Noble Truth of the end of Dukkha, which is Nirvana or Nibbana. Beyond
grasping and control and conditional existence is Nirvana. "The mind like fire
unbound." The realisation of Nirvana is supreme Bodhi or Awakening. It is waking
up to the true nature of reality. It is waking up to our true nature. Buddha Nature.
The Pali Canon of Theravada, the foundational Buddhist teachings, says little about
Nirvana, using terms like the Unconditioned the Deathless, and the Unborn.
Mahayana teachings speak more about the qualities of Nirvana and use terms like,
True Nature, Original Mind, Infinite light and Infinite life. Beyond space and time.
Nirvana defies definition.
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   Nirvana literally means "unbound&#8217; as in "Mind like fire unbound". This beautiful
image is of a flame burning by itself. Just the flame, not something burning and
giving off a flame. Picture a flame burning on a wick or stick, it seems to hover
around or just above the thing burning. The flame seems to be independent of the
thing burning but it clings to the stick and is bound to it. This sense of the

flame being unbound has often been misunderstood to mean the flame is
extinguished or blown out. This is completely opposite to the meaning of the
symbol. The flame "burns" and gives light but is no longer bound to any
combustible material. The flame is not blown out - the clinging and the clung to
is extinguished. The flame of our true nature, which is awakening, burns
independently. Ultimately Nirvana is beyond conception and intellectual
understanding. Full understanding only comes through direct experience of
this "state&#8217; which is beyond the limitations and definitions of space and
time.
<!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   4. The Noble Truth of the Path that leads to Awakening. The path is a paradox.
It is a conditioned thing that is said to help you to the unconditioned. Awakening
is not "made" by anything: it is not a product of anything including the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings. Awakening, your true nature is already always present.
We are just not awake to this reality. Clinging to limitation, and attempts
to control the ceaseless flow of phenomena and process obscures our true
nature.
<!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   The path is a processto help you remove or move beyond the conditioned
responses that obscure your true nature. In this sense the Path is ultimately about
unlearning rather than learning - another paradox. We learn so we can unlearn and
uncover. The Buddha called his teaching a Raft. To cross a turbulent river we may
need to build a raft. When built, we single-mindedly and with great energy
make our way across. Once across we don&#8217;t need to cart the raft around
with us. In other words don&#8217;t cling to anything including the teachings.
However, make sure you use them before you let them go. It&#8217;s no use knowing
everything about the raft and not getting on. The teachings are tools not
dogma. The teachings are Upaya, which means skillful means or expedient
method. It is fingers pointing at the moon - don&#8217;t confuse the finger for the
moon.
<!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   The Path
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   1. * Samma-Ditthi &#8212; Complete or Perfect Vision, also translated as
right view or understanding. Vision of the nature of reality and the path of
transformation.
<!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >   2. Samma-Sankappa &#8212; Perfected Emotion or Aspiration, also translated as right
thought or attitude. Liberating emotional intelligence in your life and acting from
love and compassion. An informed heart and feeling mind that are free to practice
letting go.
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   3. Samma-Vaca &#8212; Perfected or whole Speech. Also called right speech. Clear,
truthful, uplifting and non-harmful communication.
<!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >   4. Samma-Kammanta &#8212; Integral Action. Also called right action. An ethical
foundation for life based on the principle of non-exploitation of oneself and others.
The five precepts.
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   5. Samma-Ajiva &#8212; Proper Livelihood. Also called right livelihood. This is a
livelihood based on correct action the ethical principal of non-exploitation. The basis
of an Ideal society.
<!--l. 188--><p class="indent" >   6. Samma-Vayama&#8212; Complete or Full Effort, Energy or Vitality. Also
called right effort or diligence. Consciously directing our life energy to the

transformative path of creative and healing action that fosters wholeness. Conscious
evolution.
<!--l. 193--><p class="indent" >   7. Samma-Sati&#8212; Complete or Thorough Awareness. Also called "right
mindfulness". Developing awareness, "if you hold yourself dear watch yourself well".
Levels of Awareness and mindfulness - of things, oneself, feelings, thought, people and
Reality.
<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >   8. Samma-Samadhi &#8212; Full, Integral or Holistic Samadhi.This is often translated
as concentration, meditation, absorption or one-pointedness of mind. None of these
translations is adequate. Samadhi literally means to be fixed, absorbed in or
established at one point, thus the first level of meaning is concentration when the
mind is fixed on a single object. The second level of meaning goes further and
represents the establishment, not just of the mind, but also of the whole being in
various levels or modes of consciousness and awareness. This is Samadhi in the sense
of enlightenment or Buddhahood.
<!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >   * The word Samma means &#8217;proper&#8217;, &#8217;whole&#8217;, &#8217;thorough&#8217;, &#8217;integral&#8217;, &#8217;complete&#8217;, and
&#8217;perfect&#8217; - related to English &#8217;summit&#8217; - It does not necessarily mean &#8217;right&#8217;, as
opposed to &#8217;wrong&#8217;. However it is often translated as "right" which can send a less
than accurate message. For instance the opposite of &#8217;Right Awareness&#8217; is not
necessarily &#8217;Wrong Awareness&#8217;. It may simply be incomplete. Use of the word
&#8217;right&#8217; may make for a neat or consistent list of qualities in translations. The
down side is that it can give the impression that the Path is a narrow and
moralistic approach to the spiritual life. I use variant interpretations so you
consider the depth of meanings. What do these things mean in your life right
now?

<!--l. 304--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Gradual Sayings (Anguttara Nikaya), The Book of the Ones, Ch. IV
Translated by F. L. Woodward
<!--l. 307--><p class="indent" >   2. Discourse to Ganaka-Moggallana (Majjhima Nikaya 107)
<!--l. 309--><p class="indent" >   Thus I have heard: At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the
palace of Migara&#8217;s mother in the Eastern Monastery. Then the brahman
Ganaka-Moggallana approached the Lord; having approached he exchanged
greetings with the Lord; having conversed in a friendly and courteous way, he
sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful
distance, Ganaka-Moggallana the brahman spoke thus to the Lord: "Just as,
good Gotama, in this palace of Migara&#8217;s mother there can be seen a gradual
training, a gradual doing, a gradual practice, that is to say as far as the last
flight of stairs,1 so, too, good Gotama, for these brahmans there can be
seen a gradual training, a gradual doing, a gradual practice, that is to say
in the study [of the Vedas];2 so too, good Gotama, for these archers there
can be seen a gradual... practice, that is to say in archery; so too, good
Gotama, for us whose livelihood is calculation3 there can be seen a gradual
training, a gradual practice, that is to say in accountancy. For when we
get a pupil, good Gotama, we first of all make him calculate: &#8217;One one,
two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight
eights, nine nines, ten tens,&#8217; and we, good Gotama, also make him calculate a
hundred. Is it not possible, good Gotama, to lay down a similar gradual
training, gradual doing, gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and
discipline?"

<!--l. 331--><p class="indent" >   "It is possible, brahman, to lay down a gradual training, a gradual doing, a
gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline, Brahman, even a skilled
trainer of horses, having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred first of all gets it used to
the training in respect of wearing the bit. Then he gets it used to further training &#8212;
even so brahman, the Tathagata, having taken on a man to be tamed, first of all
disciplines him thus:
<!--l. 339--><p class="indent" >   Morality
<!--l. 341--><p class="indent" >   "&#8217;Come you, monk, be of moral habit, live controlled by the control of the
Obligations, endowed with [right] behavior and posture, seeing peril in the slightest
fault and, undertaking them, train yourself in the rules of training.&#8217; As soon,
brahman, as the monk is of moral habit, controlled by the control of the Obligations,
endowed with [right] behavior and posture; seeing peril in the slightest fault and,
undertaking them, trains himself in the rules of training, the Tathagata disciplines
him further saying:
<!--l. 350--><p class="indent" >   Sense-control
<!--l. 352--><p class="indent" >   "&#8217;Come you monk, be guarded as to the doors of the sense-organs; having seen a
material shape with the eye, do not be entranced with the general appearance, do not
be entranced with the detail; for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled,
covetousness and dejection, evil, unskillful states of mind, may flow in. So fare
along controlling it, guard the organ of sight, achieve control over the organ
of sight. Having heard a sound with the ear... Having smelt a smell with
the nose... Having savored a taste with the tongue... Having felt a touch
with the body... Having cognized a mental state with the mind, do not be
entranced with the detail. For if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled,
covetousness and dejection, evil, unskillful states of mind, may flow in. So fare along
controlling it; guard the organ of mind, achieve control over the organ of
mind.&#8217;
<!--l. 366--><p class="indent" >   Moderation in eating
<!--l. 368--><p class="indent" >   "As soon, brahman, as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the sense-organs, the
Tathagata disciplines him further, saying: &#8217;Come you, monk, be moderate in eating;
you should take food reflecting carefully, not for fun or indulgence or personal charm
or beautification, but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it
going, for keeping it unharmed, for furthering the Brahma-faring,4 with the thought:
Thus will I crush out an old feeling, and I will not allow a new feeling to arise,
and then there will be for me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in
comfort.&#8217;
<!--l. 378--><p class="indent" >   Vigilance
<!--l. 380--><p class="indent" >   "As soon, brahman, as a monk is moderate in eating, the Tathagata disciplines
him further, saying: &#8217;Come you, monk, dwell intent on vigilance; during the day while
pacing up and down, while sitting down, cleanse the mind of obstructive mental
states; during the middle watch of the night, lie down on the right side in the lion
posture, foot resting on foot, mindful, clearly conscious, reflecting on the thought of
getting up again; during the last watch of the night, when you have arisen, while
pacing up and down, while sitting down, cleanse the mind of obstructive mental
states.&#8217;
<!--l. 390--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness and clear consciousness

<!--l. 392--><p class="indent" >   "As soon, brahman, as a monk is intent on vigilance, the Tathagata disciplines
him further, saying: &#8217;Come you, monk, be possessed of mindfulness and clear
consciousness, acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or
departing, acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking
round, acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out
[the arms], acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the
outer cloak, the bowl or robe, acting with clear consciousness whether you
are eating, drinking, munching, savoring, acting with clear consciousness
whether you are obeying the calls of nature, acting with clear consciousness
whether you are walking, standing, sitting, asleep, awake, talking or being
silent.&#8217;
<!--l. 405--><p class="indent" >   Overcoming of the five hindrances
<!--l. 407--><p class="indent" >   "As soon, brahman, as he is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness, the
Tathagata disciplines him further, saying: &#8217;Come you, monk, choose a remote
lodging in a forest, at the root of a tree, on a mountain slope, in a glen, a hill
cave, a cemetery, a woodland grove, in the open, or on a heap of straw.&#8217; On
returning from alms-gathering after the meal, the monk sits down crosslegged,
holding the back erect, having made mindfulness rise up in front of him.
He, getting rid of covetousness for the world, dwells with a mind devoid of
covetousness, he cleanses the mind of covetousness. Getting rid of the taint of
ill-will, he dwells benevolent in mind; compassionate and merciful towards all
creatures and beings, he cleanses the mind of ill-will. Getting rid of sloth
and torpor, he dwells without sloth or torpor; perceiving the light, mindful
and clearly conscious he cleanses the mind of sloth and torpor. Getting rid
of restlessness and worry, he dwells calmly; the mind inward tranquil, he
cleanses the mind of restlessness and worry. Getting rid of doubt, he dwells
doubt-crossed; unperplexed as to the states that are skilled,5 he cleanses his mind of
doubt.
<!--l. 426--><p class="indent" >   Jhana
<!--l. 428--><p class="indent" >   "He, by getting rid of these five hindrances,6 which are defilements of the mind
and deleterious to intuitive wisdom, aloof from pleasures of the senses, aloof from
unskilled states of mind, enters and abides in the first meditation which is
accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness and is
rapturous and joyful. By allaying initial thought and discursive thought, his mind
subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point, he enters and abides in the
second meditation which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought,
is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful. By the fading out of
rapture, he dwells with equanimity, attentive and clearly conscious, and
experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans7 say: &#8217;Joyful lives
he who has equanimity and is mindful,&#8217; and he enters and abides in the
third meditation. By getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former
pleasures and sorrows, he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has
neither anguish nor joy, and which is entirely purified by equanimity and
mindfulness.
<!--l. 446--><p class="indent" >   "Brahman, such is my instruction for those monks who are learners who,
perfection being not yet attained, dwell longing for the incomparable security

from the bonds. But as for those monks who are perfected ones, the cankers
destroyed, who have lived the life, done what was to be done, shed the burden,
attained to their own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, and who
are freed by perfect profound knowledge &#8212; these things conduce both to
their abiding in ease here and now as well as to their mindfulness and clear
consciousness."
<!--l. 456--><p class="indent" >   When this had been said, the brahman Ganaka-Moggallana spoke thus to the
Lord:
<!--l. 459--><p class="indent" >   "Now, on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama, do all the
good Gotama&#8217;s disciples attain the unchanging goal8 &#8212; nibbana or do some not
attain it?"
<!--l. 463--><p class="indent" >   "Some of my disciples, brahman, on being exhorted and instructed thus by me,
attain the unchanging goal &#8212; nibbana; some do not attain it."
<!--l. 467--><p class="indent" >   "What is the cause, good Gotama, what the reason that; since nibbana does exist,
since the way leading to nibbana exists, since the good Gotama exists as adviser,
some of the good Gotama&#8217;s disciples on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by
the good Gotama, attain the unchanging goal &#8212; nibbana, but some do not attain
it?"
<!--l. 474--><p class="indent" >   "Well then, brahman, I will question you on this point in reply. As it is pleasing
to you, so you may answer me. What do you think about this, brahman? Are you
skilled in the way leading to Rajagaha?"
<!--l. 479--><p class="indent" >   "Yes, sir, skilled am I in the way leading to Rajagaha."
<!--l. 481--><p class="indent" >   "What do you think about this? A man might come along here wanting to go to
Rajagaha. Having approached you, he might speak thus: &#8217;I want to go to Rajagaha,
sir; show me the way to this Rajagaha.&#8217; You might speak thus to him: "Yes, my good
man, this road goes to Rajagaha; go along it for a while. When you have gone along
it for a while you will see a village; go along for a while; when you have
gone along for a while you will see a market town; go for a while. When you
have gone along for a while you will see Rajagaha with its delightful parks,
delightful forests, delightful fields, delightful ponds. But although he has
been exhorted and instructed thus by you, he might take the wrong road
and go westwards. Then a second man might come along wanting to go to
Rajagaha...(as above)... you will see Rajagaha with its delightful... ponds.&#8217;
Exhorted and instructed thus by you he might get to Rajagaha safely. What
is the cause, brahman, what the reason that, since Rajagaha does exist,
since the way leading to Rajagaha exists, since you exist as adviser, the
one man, although being exhorted and instructed thus by you, may take
the wrong road and go westwards while the other may get to Rajagaha
safely?"
<!--l. 501--><p class="indent" >   "What can I, good Gotama, do in this matter? A shower of the way, good
Gotama, am I."
<!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >   "Even so, brahman, nibbana does exist, the way leading to nibbana exists and I
exist as adviser. But some of my disciples, on being exhorted and instructed
thus by me attain the unchanging goal &#8212; nibbana, some do not attain it.
What can I, brahman, do in this matter? A shower of the way, brahman, is a
Tathagata."

<!--l. 510--><p class="indent" >   When this had been said, the brahman Ganaka-Moggallana spoke thus to the
Lord:
<!--l. 513--><p class="indent" >   "Good Gotama, as for those persons who, in want of a way of living, having gone
forth from home into homelessness without faith, who are crafty, fraudulent,
deceitful, who are unbalanced and puffed up, who are shifty, scurrilous and of loose
talk, the doors of whose sense-organs are not guarded, who do not know moderation
in eating, who are not intent on vigilance, indifferent to recluseship, not of keen
respect for the training, who are ones for abundance, lax, taking the lead in
backsliding, shirking the burden of seclusion, who are indolent, of feeble
energy, of confused mindfulness, not clearly conscious, not concentrated
but of wandering minds, who are weak in wisdom, drivelers &#8212; the good
Gotama is not in communion with them. But as for those young men of
respectable families who have gone forth from home into homelessness from
faith, who are not crafty, fraudulent or deceitful, who are not unbalanced or
puffed up, who are not shifty, scurrilous or of loose talk, the doors of whose
sense-organs are guarded, who know moderation in eating, who are intent
on vigilance, longing for recluseship, of keen respect for the training, who
are not ones for abundance, not lax, shirking, backsliding, taking the lead
in seclusion, who are of stirred up energy, self-resolute, with mindfulness
aroused, clearly conscious, concentrated, their minds one-pointed, who have
wisdom, are not drivelers &#8212; the good Gotama is in communion with them.
As, good Gotama, black gum is pointed to as chief of root-scents, as red
sandalwood is pointed to as chief of the pith-scents, as jasmine is pointed
to as chief of the flower scents &#8212; even so is the exhortation of the good
Gotama highest among the teachings of today. Excellent, good Gotama,
excellent, good Gotama. As, good Gotama, one might set upright what had been
upset, or disclose what had been covered, or show the way to one who had
gone astray, or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness so that those with vision
might see material shapes &#8212; even so in many a figure is dhamma made
clear by the good Gotama. I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge
and to dhamma and to the Order of monks May the good Gotama accept
me as a lay-follower going for refuge from today forth for as long as life
lasts."

Bamboo Grove at the squirrels&#8217; feeding place. Now at that time the novice Aciravata
was staying in the Forest Hut.1 Then prince Jayasena,2 who was always pacing up
and down, always roaming about on foot, approached the novice Aciravata; having
approached he exchanged greetings with the novice Aciravata; having exchanged
greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he sat down at a respectful distance. While he
was sitting down at a respectful distance, Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the novice
Aciravata:
<!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >   "I have heard, good Aggivessana, that if a monk is abiding here diligent, ardent,

heard it, as he has mastered it."
<!--l. 608--><p class="indent" >   "I, prince, am not able to teach you dhamma as I have heard it, as I have
mastered it. Now, if I were to teach you dhamma as I have heard it, as I have
mastered it, and if you could not understand the meaning of what I said, that would
be weariness to me, that would be a vexation to me."
<!--l. 614--><p class="indent" >   "Let the reverend Aggivessana teach me dhamma as he has heard it, as he has

says."
<!--l. 618--><p class="indent" >   "If I were to teach you dhamma, prince, as I have heard it, as I have mastered it,

I will remain as I am; I will not question the reverend Aggivessana further on this

<!--l. 630--><p class="indent" >   Then the novice Aciravata taught dhamma to Prince Jayasena as he had heard it,
as he had mastered it. When this had been said, Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the

<!--l. 634--><p class="indent" >   "This is impossible, good Aggivessana, it cannot come to pass that a
monk abiding diligent, ardent, self-resolute, should attain one-pointedness

that this was impossible and could not come to pass, rising from his seat,
departed.

the Lord; having approached and greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful

the Lord the whole of the conversation he had with Prince Jayasena as far as
it had gone. When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the novice
Aciravata:

sense-pleasures, should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known by
renunciation, seen by renunciation, attained by renunciation, realized by renunciation

about this, Aggivessana? Would these two elephants or horses or oxen that

Aggivessana, there were a great mountain slope near a village or a market-town
which two friends, coming hand in hand from that village or market-town might
approach; having approached the mountain slope one friend might remain at the foot
while the other might climb to the top. Then the friend standing at the foot
of the mountain slope might speak thus to the one standing on the top:
&#8217;My dear, what do you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope?&#8217;
He might reply: &#8217;As I stand on the top of the mountain slope I, my dear,
see delightful parks, delightful woods, delightful stretches of level ground
delightful ponds.&#8217; But the other might speak thus: &#8217;This is impossible, it
cannot come to pass, my dear, that, as you stand on the top of the mountain
slope, you should see... delightful ponds.&#8217; Then the friend who had been
standing on top of the mountain slope having come down to the foot and taken
his friend by the arm, making him climb to the top of the mountain slope

and giving him a moment in which to regain his breath, might speak to
him thus: &#8217;Now, my dear, what is it that you see as you stand on the top
of the mountain slope?&#8217; He might speak thus: &#8217;I, my dear, as I stand on
the top of the mountain slope, see delightful parks... delightful ponds.&#8217; He

say: &#8217;I, my dear, as I stand on the top of the mountain slope, see delightful

<!--l. 702--><p class="indent" >   "Even so but to a still greater degree, Aggivessana, is Prince Jayasena hemmed

&#8217;You, good elephant hunter, mount the king&#8217;s elephant and go into an elephant forest.
When you see a forest elephant, tie him to the neck of the king&#8217;s elephant.&#8217; And,
Aggivessana, the elephant hunter having answered: &#8217;Yes, sire,&#8217; in assent to the noble
anointed king, mounts the king&#8217;s elephant and goes into an elephant forest.
Seeing a forest elephant, he ties him to the neck of the king&#8217;s elephant. So the
king&#8217;s elephant brings him out into the open. But, Aggivessana, the forest
elephant has this longing, that is to say for the elephant forest. But in regard
to him the elephant hunter tells the noble anointed king that the forest
elephant has got out into the open. The noble anointed king then addresses an
elephant tamer, saying: &#8217;Come you, good elephant tamer, tame the forest
elephant by subduing his forest ways, by subduing his forest memories, and
aspirations and by subduing his distress, his fretting and fever for the forest, by
making him pleased with the villages and by accustoming him to human
ways.&#8217;
<!--l. 735--><p class="indent" >   "And, Aggivessana, the elephant tamer, having answered &#8217;Yes, sire,&#8217; in assent to
the noble anointed king, driving a great post into the ground ties the forest elephant
to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways... and accustom him to human ways.
Then the elephant tamer addresses him with such words as are gentle, pleasing to the
ear, affectionate, going to the heart, urbane, pleasant to the manyfolk, liked by the
manyfolk. And, Aggivessana, the forest elephant, on being addressed with words that
are gentle... liked by the manyfolk, listens, lends ear and bends his mind to learning.
Next the elephant tamer supplies him with grass-fodder and water. When,

Aggivessana, the forest elephant has accepted the grass-fodder and water from the
elephant tamer, it occurs to the elephant tamer: &#8217;The king&#8217;s elephant will now
live.&#8217; Then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task, saying: &#8217;Take
up, put down.&#8217; When, Aggivessana the king&#8217;s elephant is obedient to the
elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to take up and put down, then the
elephant tamer makes him do a further task, saying: &#8217;Get up, sit down.&#8217;
When, Aggivessana, the king&#8217;s elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and
acts on his instructions to get up and sit down, then the elephant tamer
makes him do a further task; known as &#8217;standing your ground&#8217;: he ties a
shield to the great beast&#8217;s trunk; a man holding a lance is sitting on his
neck, and men holding lances are standing surrounding him on all sides;
and the elephant tamer, holding a lance with a long shaft, is standing in
front. While he is doing the task of &#8217;standing your ground&#8217; he does not move
a fore-leg nor does he move a hind-leg, nor does he move the forepart of
his body, nor does he move the hindpart of his body, nor does he move his
head, nor does he move an ear, nor does he move a tusk, nor does he move
his tail, nor does he move his trunk. A king&#8217;s elephant is one who endures
blows of sword, axe, arrow, hatchet, and the resounding din of drum and
kettle-drum, conch and tam-tam, he is [like] purified gold purged of all its dross
and impurities, fit for a king, a royal possession and reckoned as a kingly
attribute.
<!--l. 769--><p class="indent" >   Acquisition of faith
<!--l. 771--><p class="indent" >   "Even so, Aggivessana, does a Tathagata arise here in the world, a perfected one,
fully Self-Awakened One, endowed with right knowledge and conduct, well-farer,
knower of the worlds, the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed, the Awakened
One, the Lord. He makes known this world with the devas, with Mara, with Brahma,
the creation with its recluses and brahmans, its devas and men, having realized them
by his own super-knowledge. He teaches dhamma which is lovely at the
beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending, with the spirit and the
letters; he proclaims the Brahma-faring,3 wholly fulfilled, quite purified.
A householder or a householder&#8217;s son or one born in another family hears
that dhamma. Having heard that dhamma he gains faith in the Tathagata.
Endowed with this faith that he has acquired, he reflects in this way: &#8217;The
household life is confined and dusty, going forth is in the open; it is not easy for
one who lives in a house to fare the Brahma-faring wholly fulfilled, wholly
pure, polished like a conch-shell. Suppose now that I, having cut off hair
and beard, having put on saffron robes, should go forth from home into
homelessness?&#8217; After a time, getting rid of his wealth, be it small or great,
getting rid of his circle of relations, be it small or great, having cut off his
hair and beard, having put on saffron robes, he goes forth from home into
homelessness. To this extent, Aggivessana, the ariyan disciple gets out into the

Returning from alms-gathering, after the meal, he sits down cross-legged,

discursive thought (vitakka-vicara). This latter explanation is favored by the
facts that (1) in our text, the practice of Satipatthana is preceded by the
temporary abandonment of the five Hindrances, which indicates a high degree of

<!--l. 1236--><p class="indent" >   Preface
<!--l. 1238--><p class="indent" >   The essence of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching can be summed up in two principles: the
Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. The first covers the side of

doctrine, and the primary response it elicits is understanding; the second covers the
side of discipline, in the broadest sense of that word, and the primary response it
calls for is practice. In the structure of the teaching these two principles lock together
into an indivisible unity called the dhamma-vinaya, the doctrine-and-discipline, or, in
brief, the Dhamma. The internal unity of the Dhamma is guaranteed by the
fact that the last of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the way, is the
Noble Eightfold Path, while the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, right
view, is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. Thus the two principles
penetrate and include one another, the formula of the Four Noble Truths
containing the Eightfold Path and the Noble Eightfold Path containing the Four
Truths.
<!--l. 1253--><p class="indent" >   Given this integral unity, it would be pointless to pose the question which of the
two aspects of the Dhamma has greater value, the doctrine or the path. But if we did
risk the pointless by asking that question, the answer would have to be the path. The
path claims primacy because it is precisely this that brings the teaching to life. The
path translates the Dhamma from a collection of abstract formulas into a continually
unfolding disclosure of truth. It gives an outlet from the problem of suffering with
which the teaching starts. And it makes the teaching&#8217;s goal, liberation from suffering,
accessible to us in our own experience, where alone it takes on authentic
meaning.
<!--l. 1264--><p class="indent" >   To follow the Noble Eightfold Path is a matter of practice rather than intellectual
knowledge, but to apply the path correctly it has to be properly understood. In fact,
right understanding of the path is itself a part of the practice. It is a facet of
right view, the first path factor, the forerunner and guide for the rest of
the path. Thus, though initial enthusiasm might suggest that the task of
intellectual comprehension may be shelved as a bothersome distraction,
mature consideration reveals it to be quite essential to ultimate success in the
practice.
<!--l. 1273--><p class="indent" >   The present book aims at contributing towards a proper understanding of the
Noble Eightfold Path by investigating its eight factors and their components to
determine exactly what they involve. I have attempted to be concise, using as the
framework for exposition the Buddha&#8217;s own words in explanation of the
path factors, as found in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali canon. To assist the
reader with limited access to primary sources even in translation, I have
tried to confine my selection of quotations as much as possible (but not
completely) to those found in Venerable Nyanatiloka&#8217;s classic anthology, The Word
of the Buddha. In some cases passages taken from that work have been
slightly modified, to accord with my own preferred renderings. For further
amplification of meaning I have sometimes drawn upon the commentaries; especially
in my accounts of concentration and wisdom (Chapters VII and VIII) I
have relied heavily on the Visuddhimagga(The Path of Purification), a vast
encyclopedic work which systematizes the practice of the path in a detailed and
comprehensive manner. Limitations of space prevent an exhaustive treatment
of each factor. To compensate for this deficiency I have included a list of
recommended readings at the end, which the reader may consult for more detailed
explanations of individual path factors. For full commitment to the practice of

the path, however, especially in its advanced stages of concentration and
insight, it will be extremely helpful to have contact with a properly qualified
teacher.

<!--l. 1311--><p class="indent" >   Chapter I: The Way to the End of Suffering
<!--l. 1313--><p class="indent" >   The search for a spiritual path is born out of suffering. It does not start with
lights and ecstasy, but with the hard tacks of pain, disappointment, and confusion.
However, for suffering to give birth to a genuine spiritual search, it must amount to
more than something passively received from without. It has to trigger an inner
realization, a perception which pierces through the facile complacency of
our usual encounter with the world to glimpse the insecurity perpetually
gaping underfoot. When this insight dawns, even if only momentarily, it can
precipitate a profound personal crisis. It overturns accustomed goals and
values, mocks our routine preoccupations, leaves old enjoyments stubbornly
unsatisfying.
<!--l. 1325--><p class="indent" >   At first such changes generally are not welcome. We try to deny our
vision and to smother our doubts; we struggle to drive away the discontent
with new pursuits. But the flame of inquiry, once lit, continues to burn, and
if we do not let ourselves be swept away by superficial readjustments or
slouch back into a patched up version of our natural optimism, eventually the
original glimmering of insight will again flare up, again confront us with our
essential plight. It is precisely at that point, with all escape routes blocked, that
we are ready to seek a way to bring our disquietude to an end. No longer
can we continue to drift complacently through life, driven blindly by our
hunger for sense pleasures and by the pressure of prevailing social norms. A
deeper reality beckons us; we have heard the call of a more stable, more
authentic happiness, and until we arrive at our destination we cannot rest
content.
<!--l. 1340--><p class="indent" >   But it is just then that we find ourselves facing a new difficulty. Once we come to
recognize the need for a spiritual path we discover that spiritual teachings are by no
means homogeneous and mutually compatible. When we browse through the shelves
of humanity&#8217;s spiritual heritage, both ancient and contemporary, we do not find a
single tidy volume but a veritable bazaar of spiritual systems and disciplines each
offering themselves to us as the highest, the fastest, the most powerful, or the most
profound solution to our quest for the Ultimate. Confronted with this melange, we
fall into confusion trying to size them up &#8212; to decide which is truly liberative,
a real solution to our needs, and which is a sidetrack beset with hidden
flaws.

<!--l. 1353--><p class="indent" >   One approach to resolving this problem that is popular today is the eclectic one:
to pick and choose from the various traditions whatever seems amenable to our
needs, welding together different practices and techniques into a synthetic whole that
is personally satisfying. Thus one may combine Buddhist mindfulness meditation
with sessions of Hindu mantra recitation, Christian prayer with Sufi dancing, Jewish
Kabbala with Tibetan visualization exercises. Eclecticism, however, though
sometimes helpful in making a transition from a predominantly worldly and
materialistic way of life to one that takes on a spiritual hue, eventually wears thin.
While it makes a comfortable halfway house, it is not comfortable as a final
vehicle.
<!--l. 1365--><p class="indent" >   There are two interrelated flaws in eclecticism that account for its ultimate
inadequacy. One is that eclecticism compromises the very traditions it draws upon.
The great spiritual traditions themselves do not propose their disciplines as
independent techniques that may be excised from their setting and freely recombined
to enhance the felt quality of our lives. They present them, rather, as parts of an
integral whole, of a coherent vision regarding the fundamental nature of
reality and the final goal of the spiritual quest. A spiritual tradition is not a
shallow stream in which one can wet one&#8217;s feet and then beat a quick retreat
to the shore. It is a mighty, tumultuous river which would rush through
the entire landscape of one&#8217;s life, and if one truly wishes to travel on it,
one must be courageous enough to launch one&#8217;s boat and head out for the
depths.
<!--l. 1379--><p class="indent" >   The second defect in eclecticism follows from the first. As spiritual practices are
built upon visions regarding the nature of reality and the final good, these visions are
not mutually compatible. When we honestly examine the teachings of these
traditions, we will find that major differences in perspective reveal themselves to
our sight, differences which cannot be easily dismissed as alternative ways
of saying the same thing. Rather, they point to very different experiences
constituting the supreme goal and the path that must be trodden to reach that
goal.
<!--l. 1388--><p class="indent" >   Hence, because of the differences in perspectives and practices that the different
spiritual traditions propose, once we decide that we have outgrown eclecticism and
feel that we are ready to make a serious commitment to one particular path, we find
ourselves confronted with the challenge of choosing a path that will lead us to true
enlightenment and liberation. One cue to resolving this dilemma is to clarify to
ourselves our fundamental aim, to determine what we seek in a genuinely liberative
path. If we reflect carefully, it will become clear that the prime requirement is a
way to the end of suffering. All problems ultimately can be reduced to the
problem of suffering; thus what we need is a way that will end this problem
finally and completely. Both these qualifying words are important. The path
has to lead to a complete end of suffering, to an end of suffering in all its
forms, and to a final end of suffering, to bring suffering to an irreversible
stop.
<!--l. 1403--><p class="indent" >   But here we run up against another question. How are we to find such a path &#8212; a
path which has the capacity to lead us to the full and final end of suffering? Until we
actually follow a path to its goal we cannot know with certainty where it leads, and

in order to follow a path to its goal we must place complete trust in the efficacy of
the path. The pursuit of a spiritual path is not like selecting a new suit of clothes. To
select a new suit one need only try on a number of suits, inspect oneself in the
mirror, and select the suit in which one appears most attractive. The choice of a
spiritual path is closer to marriage: one wants a partner for life, one whose
companionship will prove as trustworthy and durable as the pole star in the night
sky.
<!--l. 1416--><p class="indent" >   Faced with this new dilemma, we may think that we have reached a dead end and
conclude that we have nothing to guide us but personal inclination, if not a flip of the
coin. However, our selection need not be as blind and uninformed as we
imagine, for we do have a guideline to help us. Since spiritual paths are
generally presented in the framework of a total teaching, we can evaluate the
effectiveness of any particular path by investigating the teaching which expounds
it.
<!--l. 1424--><p class="indent" >   In making this investigation we can look to three criteria as standards for
evaluation:
<!--l. 1427--><p class="indent" >   (1) First, the teaching has to give a full and accurate picture of the range of
suffering. If the picture of suffering it gives is incomplete or defective, then the path it
sets forth will most likely be flawed, unable to yield a satisfactory solution. Just as an
ailing patient needs a doctor who can make a full and correct diagnosis of his illness,
so in seeking release from suffering we need a teaching that presents a reliable
account of our condition.
<!--l. 1435--><p class="indent" >   (2) The second criterion calls for a correct analysis of the causes giving rise to
suffering. The teaching cannot stop with a survey of the outward symptoms. It has to
penetrate beneath the symptoms to the level of causes, and to describe those causes
accurately. If a teaching makes a faulty causal analysis, there is little likelihood that
its treatment will succeed.
<!--l. 1442--><p class="indent" >   (3) The third criterion pertains directly to the path itself. It stipulates that the
path which the teaching offers has to remove suffering at its source. This means it
must provide a method to cut off suffering by eradicating its causes. If it
fails to bring about this root-level solution, its value is ultimately nil. The
path it prescribes might help to remove symptoms and make us feel that
all is well; but one afflicted with a fatal disease cannot afford to settle for
cosmetic surgery when below the surface the cause of his malady continues to
thrive.
<!--l. 1452--><p class="indent" >   To sum up, we find three requirements for a teaching proposing to offer a true
path to the end of suffering: first, it has to set forth a full and accurate picture of the
range of suffering; second, it must present a correct analysis of the causes of
suffering; and third, it must give us the means to eradicate the causes of
suffering.
<!--l. 1458--><p class="indent" >   This is not the place to evaluate the various spiritual disciplines in terms of these
criteria. Our concern is only with the Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha, and
with the solution this teaching offers to the problem of suffering. That the teaching
should be relevant to this problem is evident from its very nature; for it is
formulated, not as a set of doctrines about the origin and end of things commanding
belief, but as a message of deliverance from suffering claiming to be verifiable

in our own experience. Along with that message there comes a method of
practice, a way leading to the end of suffering. This way is the Noble Eightfold
Path (ariya atthangika magga). The Eightfold Path stands at the very heart
of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching. It was the discovery of the path that gave the
Buddha&#8217;s own enlightenment a universal significance and elevated him from the
status of a wise and benevolent sage to that of a world teacher. To his own
disciples he was pre-eminently "the arouser of the path unarisen before, the
producer of the path not produced before, the declarer of the path not declared
before, the knower of the path, the seer of the path, the guide along the path"
(MN 108). And he himself invites the seeker with the promise and challenge:
"You yourselves must strive. The Buddhas are only teachers. The meditative
ones who practice the path are released from the bonds of evil" (Dhp. v.
276).
<!--l. 1481--><p class="indent" >   To see the Noble Eightfold Path as a viable vehicle to liberation, we have to check
it out against our three criteria: to look at the Buddha&#8217;s account of the range
of suffering, his analysis of its causes, and the programme he offers as a
remedy.
<!--l. 1486--><p class="indent" >   The Range of Suffering
<!--l. 1488--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha does not merely touch the problem of suffering tangentially; he
makes it, rather, the very cornerstone of his teaching. He starts the Four Noble
Truths that sum up his message with the announcement that life is inseparably tied
to something he calls dukkha. The Pali word is often translated as suffering, but it
means something deeper than pain and misery. It refers to a basic unsatisfactoriness
running through our lives, the lives of all but the enlightened. Sometimes this
unsatisfactoriness erupts into the open as sorrow, grief, disappointment,
or despair; but usually it hovers at the edge of our awareness as a vague
unlocalized sense that things are never quite perfect, never fully adequate to our
expectations of what they should be. This fact of dukkha, the Buddha says, is
the only real spiritual problem. The other problems &#8212; the theological and
metaphysical questions that have taunted religious thinkers through the centuries
&#8212; he gently waves aside as "matters not tending to liberation." What he
teaches, he says, is just suffering and the ending of suffering, dukkha and its
cessation.
<!--l. 1506--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha does not stop with generalities. He goes on to expose the different
forms that dukkha takes, both the evident and the subtle. He starts with what is
close at hand, with the suffering inherent in the physical process of life itself. Here
dukkha shows up in the events of birth, aging, and death, in our susceptibility to
sickness, accidents, and injuries, even in hunger and thirst. It appears again in our
inner reactions to disagreeable situations and events: in the sorrow, anger,
frustration, and fear aroused by painful separations, by unpleasant encounters, by the
failure to get what we want. Even our pleasures, the Buddha says, are not immune
from dukkha. They give us happiness while they last, but they do not last
forever; eventually they must pass away, and when they go the loss leaves
us feeling deprived. Our lives, for the most part, are strung out between
the thirst for pleasure and the fear of pain. We pass our days running after
the one and running away from the other, seldom enjoying the peace of

contentment; real satisfaction seems somehow always out of reach, just beyond the
next horizon. Then in the end we have to die: to give up the identity we
spent our whole life building, to leave behind everything and everyone we
love.
<!--l. 1526--><p class="indent" >   But even death, the Buddha teaches, does not bring us to the end of dukkha, for
the life process does not stop with death. When life ends in one place, with one body,
the "mental continuum," the individual stream of consciousness, springs up again
elsewhere with a new body as its physical support. Thus the cycle goes on over and
over &#8212; birth, aging, and death &#8212; driven by the thirst for more existence. The
Buddha declares that this round of rebirths &#8212; called samsara, "the wandering" &#8212;
has been turning through beginningless time. It is without a first point,
without temporal origin. No matter how far back in time we go we always find
living beings &#8212; ourselves in previous lives &#8212; wandering from one state of
existence to another. The Buddha describes various realms where rebirth can
take place: realms of torment, the animal realm, the human realm, realms
of celestial bliss. But none of these realms can offer a final refuge. Life in
any plane must come to an end. It is impermanent and thus marked with
that insecurity which is the deepest meaning of dukkha. For this reason one
aspiring to the complete end of dukkha cannot rest content with any mundane
achievement, with any status, but must win emancipation from the entire unstable
whirl.
<!--l. 1547--><p class="indent" >   The Causes of Suffering
<!--l. 1549--><p class="indent" >   A teaching proposing to lead to the end of suffering must, as we said, give a
reliable account of its causal origination. For if we want to put a stop to
suffering, we have to stop it where it begins, with its causes. To stop the causes
requires a thorough knowledge of what they are and how they work; thus
the Buddha devotes a sizeable section of his teaching to laying bare "the
truth of the origin of dukkha." The origin he locates within ourselves, in a
fundamental malady that permeates our being, causing disorder in our own minds
and vitiating our relationships with others and with the world. The sign of
this malady can be seen in our proclivity to certain unwholesome mental
states called in Pali kilesas, usually translated "defilements." The most basic
defilements are the triad of greed, aversion, and delusion. Greed (lobha) is
self-centered desire: the desire for pleasure and possessions, the drive for
survival, the urge to bolster the sense of ego with power, status, and prestige.
Aversion (dosa) signifies the response of negation, expressed as rejection,
irritation, condemnation, hatred, enmity, anger, and violence. Delusion (moha)
means mental darkness: the thick coat of insensitivity which blocks out clear
understanding.
<!--l. 1569--><p class="indent" >   From these three roots emerge the various other defilements &#8212; conceit, jealousy,
ambition, lethargy, arrogance, and the rest &#8212; and from all these defilements
together, the roots and the branches, comes dukkha in its diverse forms: as pain and
sorrow, as fear and discontent, as the aimless drifting through the round of birth and
death. To gain freedom from suffering, therefore, we have to eliminate the
defilements. But the work of removing the defilements has to proceed in a methodical
way. It cannot be accomplished simply by an act of will, by wanting them to go away.

The work must be guided by investigation. We have to find out what the
defilements depend upon and then see how it lies within our power to remove their
support.
<!--l. 1581--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha teaches that there is one defilement which gives rise to all the others,
one root which holds them all in place. This root is ignorance (avijja).1 Ignorance is
not mere absence of knowledge, a lack of knowing particular pieces of information.
Ignorance can co-exist with a vast accumulation of itemized knowledge, and in its
own way it can be tremendously shrewd and resourceful. As the basic root of dukkha,
ignorance is a fundamental darkness shrouding the mind. Sometimes this
ignorance operates in a passive manner, merely obscuring correct understanding.
At other times it takes on an active role: it becomes the great deceiver,
conjuring up a mass of distorted perceptions and conceptions which the mind
grasps as attributes of the world, unaware that they are its own deluded
constructs.
<!--l. 1594--><p class="indent" >   In these erroneous perceptions and ideas we find the soil that nurtures the
defilements. The mind catches sight of some possibility of pleasure, accepts it at face
value, and the result is greed. Our hunger for gratification is thwarted, obstacles
appear, and up spring anger and aversion. Or we struggle over ambiguities, our sight
clouds, and we become lost in delusion. With this we discover the breeding ground of
dukkha: ignorance issuing in the defilements, the defilements issuing in suffering. As
long as this causal matrix stands we are not yet beyond danger. We might still find
pleasure and enjoyment &#8212; sense pleasures, social pleasures, pleasures of the
mind and heart. But no matter how much pleasure we might experience,
no matter how successful we might be at dodging pain, the basic problem
remains at the core of our being and we continue to move within the bounds of
dukkha.
<!--l. 1609--><p class="indent" >   Cutting Off the Causes of Suffering
<!--l. 1611--><p class="indent" >   To free ourselves from suffering fully and finally we have to eliminate it by the
root, and that means to eliminate ignorance. But how does one go about eliminating
ignorance? The answer follows clearly from the nature of the adversary. Since
ignorance is a state of not knowing things as they really are, what is needed is
knowledge of things as they really are. Not merely conceptual knowledge,
knowledge as idea, but perceptual knowledge, a knowing which is also a seeing.
This kind of knowing is called wisdom (paa). Wisdom helps to correct the
distorting work of ignorance. It enables us to grasp things as they are in
actuality, directly and immediately, free from the screen of ideas, views,
and assumptions our minds ordinarily set up between themselves and the
real.
<!--l. 1624--><p class="indent" >   To eliminate ignorance we need wisdom, but how is wisdom to be acquired? As
indubitable knowledge of the ultimate nature of things, wisdom cannot be gained by
mere learning, by gathering and accumulating a battery of facts. However, the
Buddha says, wisdom can be cultivated. It comes into being through a set of
conditions, conditions which we have the power to develop. These conditions are
actually mental factors, components of consciousness, which fit together into a
systematic structure that can be called a path in the word&#8217;s essential meaning: a
courseway for movement leading to a goal. The goal here is the end of suffering, and

the path leading to it is the Noble Eightfold Path with its eight factors: right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration.
<!--l. 1638--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha calls this path the middle way (majjhima patipada). It is the middle
way because it steers clear of two extremes, two misguided attempts to gain release
from suffering. One is the extreme of indulgence in sense pleasures, the attempt to
extinguish dissatisfaction by gratifying desire. This approach gives pleasure, but the
enjoyment won is gross, transitory, and devoid of deep contentment. The Buddha
recognized that sensual desire can exercise a tight grip over the minds of
human beings, and he was keenly aware of how ardently attached people
become to the pleasures of the senses. But he also knew that this pleasure is
far inferior to the happiness that arises from renunciation, and therefore
he repeatedly taught that the way to the Ultimate eventually requires the
relinquishment of sensual desire. Thus the Buddha describes the indulgence
in sense pleasures as "low, common, worldly, ignoble, not leading to the
goal."
<!--l. 1653--><p class="indent" >   The other extreme is the practice of self-mortification, the attempt to gain
liberation by afflicting the body. This approach may stem from a genuine aspiration
for deliverance, but it works within the compass of a wrong assumption
that renders the energy expended barren of results. The error is taking the
body to be the cause of bondage, when the real source of trouble lies in the
mind &#8212; the mind obsessed by greed, aversion, and delusion. To rid the
mind of these defilements the affliction of the body is not only useless but
self-defeating, for it is the impairment of a necessary instrument. Thus the
Buddha describes this second extreme as "painful, ignoble, not leading to the
goal."2
<!--l. 1665--><p class="indent" >   Aloof from these two extreme approaches is the Noble Eightfold Path, called
the middle way, not in the sense that it effects a compromise between the
extremes, but in the sense that it transcends them both by avoiding the errors
that each involves. The path avoids the extreme of sense indulgence by its
recognition of the futility of desire and its stress on renunciation. Desire and
sensuality, far from being means to happiness, are springs of suffering to be
abandoned as the requisite of deliverance. But the practice of renunciation
does not entail the tormenting of the body. It consists in mental training,
and for this the body must be fit, a sturdy support for the inward work.
Thus the body is to be looked after well, kept in good health, while the
mental faculties are trained to generate the liberating wisdom. That is the
middle way, the Noble Eightfold Path, which "gives rise to vision, gives rise to
knowledge, and leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to
Nibbana."3
<!--l. 1681--><p class="indent" >   Chapter II: Right View (Samma Ditthi)
<!--l. 1683--><p class="indent" >   The eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path are not steps to be followed in
sequence, one after another. They can be more aptly described as components rather
than as steps, comparable to the intertwining strands of a single cable that
requires the contributions of all the strands for maximum strength. With a
certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously, each

supporting the others. However, until that point is reached, some sequence in
the unfolding of the path is inevitable. Considered from the standpoint of
practical training, the eight path factors divide into three groups: (i) the moral
discipline group (silakkhandha), made up of right speech, right action, and right
livelihood; (ii) the concentration group (samadhikkhandha), made up of right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration; and (iii) the wisdom group
(paakkhandha), made up of right view and right intention. These three
groups represent three stages of training: the training in the higher moral
discipline, the training in the higher consciousness, and the training in the higher
wisdom.4
<!--l. 1700--><p class="indent" >   The order of the three trainings is determined by the overall aim and direction of
the path. Since the final goal to which the path leads, liberation from suffering,
depends ultimately on uprooting ignorance, the climax of the path must be the
training directly opposed to ignorance. This is the training in wisdom, designed to
awaken the faculty of penetrative understanding which sees things "as they really
are." Wisdom unfolds by degrees, but even the faintest flashes of insight presuppose
as their basis a mind that has been concentrated, cleared of disturbance and
distraction. Concentration is achieved through the training in the higher
consciousness, the second division of the path, which brings the calm and
collectedness needed to develop wisdom. But in order for the mind to be unified in
concentration, a check must be placed on the unwholesome dispositions
which ordinarily dominate its workings, since these dispositions disperse
the beam of attention and scatter it among a multitude of concerns. The
unwholesome dispositions continue to rule as long as they are permitted
to gain expression through the channels of body and speech as bodily and
verbal deeds. Therefore, at the very outset of training, it is necessary to
restrain the faculties of action, to prevent them from becoming tools of the
defilements. This task is accomplished by the first division of the path, the
training in moral discipline. Thus the path evolves through its three stages,
with moral discipline as the foundation for concentration, concentration
the foundation for wisdom, and wisdom the direct instrument for reaching
liberation.
<!--l. 1725--><p class="indent" >   Perplexity sometimes arises over an apparent inconsistency in the arrangement
of the path factors and the threefold training. Wisdom &#8212; which includes
right view and right intention &#8212; is the last stage in the threefold training,
yet its factors are placed at the beginning of the path rather than at its
end, as might be expected according to the canon of strict consistency. The
sequence of the path factors, however, is not the result of a careless slip,
but is determined by an important logistical consideration, namely, that
right view and right intention of a preliminary type are called for at the
outset as the spur for entering the threefold training. Right view provides the
perspective for practice, right intention the sense of direction. But the two do not
expire in this preparatory role. For when the mind has been refined by the
training in moral discipline and concentration, it arrives at a superior right
view and right intention, which now form the proper training in the higher
wisdom.

<!--l. 1741--><p class="indent" >   Right view is the forerunner of the entire path, the guide for all the other factors.
It enables us to understand our starting point, our destination, and the successive
landmarks to pass as practice advances. To attempt to engage in the practice without
a foundation of right view is to risk getting lost in the futility of undirected
movement. Doing so might be compared to wanting to drive someplace without
consulting a roadmap or listening to the suggestions of an experienced driver. One
might get into the car and start to drive, but rather than approaching closer to one&#8217;s
destination, one is more likely to move farther away from it. To arrive at the
desired place one has to have some idea of its general direction and of the
roads leading to it. Analogous considerations apply to the practice of the
path, which takes place in a framework of understanding established by right
view.
<!--l. 1756--><p class="indent" >   The importance of right view can be gauged from the fact that our perspectives
on the crucial issues of reality and value have a bearing that goes beyond mere
theoretical convictions. They govern our attitudes, our actions, our whole orientation
to existence. Our views might not be clearly formulated in our mind; we might have
only a hazy conceptual grasp of our beliefs. But whether formulated or not, expressed
or maintained in silence, these views have a far-reaching influence. They structure
our perceptions, order our values, crystallize into the ideational framework
through which we interpret to ourselves the meaning of our being in the
world.
<!--l. 1767--><p class="indent" >   These views then condition action. They lie behind our choices and goals, and our
efforts to turn these goals from ideals into actuality. The actions themselves might
determine consequences, but the actions along with their consequences hinge on the
views from which they spring. Since views imply an "ontological commitment," a
decision on the question of what is real and true, it follows that views divide into two
classes, right views and wrong views. The former correspond to what is real, the
latter deviate from the real and confirm the false in its place. These two
different kinds of views, the Buddha teaches, lead to radically disparate lines of
action, and thence to opposite results. If we hold a wrong view, even if that
view is vague, it will lead us towards courses of action that eventuate in
suffering. On the other hand, if we adopt a right view, that view will steer us
towards right action, and thereby towards freedom from suffering. Though
our conceptual orientation towards the world might seem innocuous and
inconsequential, when looked at closely it reveals itself to be the decisive
determinant of our whole course of future development. The Buddha himself says
that he sees no single factor so responsible for the arising of unwholesome
states of mind as wrong view, and no factor so helpful for the arising of
wholesome states of mind as right view. Again, he says that there is no single
factor so responsible for the suffering of living beings as wrong view, and no
factor so potent in promoting the good of living beings as right view (AN
1:16.2).
<!--l. 1791--><p class="indent" >   In its fullest measure right view involves a correct understanding of the entire
Dhamma or teaching of the Buddha, and thus its scope is equal to the range
of the Dhamma itself. But for practical purposes two kinds of right view
stand out as primary. One is mundane right view, right view which operates

within the confines of the world. The other is supramundane right view, the
superior right view which leads to liberation from the world. The first is
concerned with the laws governing material and spiritual progress within the
round of becoming, with the principles that lead to higher and lower states of
existence, to mundane happiness and suffering. The second is concerned with the
principles essential to liberation. It does not aim merely at spiritual progress
from life to life, but at emancipation from the cycle of recurring lives and
deaths.
<!--l. 1805--><p class="indent" >   Mundane Right View
<!--l. 1807--><p class="indent" >   Mundane right view involves a correct grasp of the law of kamma, the moral
efficacy of action. Its literal name is "right view of the ownership of action"
(kammassakata sammaditthi), and it finds its standard formulation in the statement:
"Beings are the owners of their actions, the heirs of their actions; they spring from
their actions, are bound to their actions, and are supported by their actions.
Whatever deeds they do, good or bad, of those they shall be heirs."5 More specific
formulations have also come down in the texts. One stock passage, for example,
affirms that virtuous actions such as giving and offering alms have moral significance,
that good and bad deeds produce corresponding fruits, that one has a duty
to serve mother and father, that there is rebirth and a world beyond the
visible one, and that religious teachers of high attainment can be found
who expound the truth about the world on the basis of their own superior
realization.6
<!--l. 1823--><p class="indent" >   To understand the implications of this form of right view we first have to examine
the meaning of its key term, kamma. The word kamma means action. For Buddhism
the relevant kind of action is volitional action, deeds expressive of morally
determinate volition, since it is volition that gives the action ethical significance.
Thus the Buddha expressly identifies action with volition. In a discourse on the
analysis of kamma he says: "Monks, it is volition that I call action (kamma).
Having willed, one performs an action through body, speech, or mind."7 The
identification of kamma with volition makes kamma essentially a mental
event, a factor originating in the mind which seeks to actualize the mind&#8217;s
drives, dispositions, and purposes. Volition comes into being through any of
three channels &#8212; body, speech, or mind &#8212; called the three doors of action
(kammadvara). A volition expressed through the body is a bodily action; a
volition expressed through speech is a verbal action; and a volition that issues
in thoughts, plans, ideas, and other mental states without gaining outer
expression is a mental action. Thus the one factor of volition differentiates into
three types of kamma according to the channel through which it becomes
manifest.
<!--l. 1843--><p class="indent" >   Right view requires more than a simple knowledge of the general meaning of
kamma. It is also necessary to understand: (i) the ethical distinction of kamma into
the unwholesome and the wholesome; (ii) the principal cases of each type; and (iii)
the roots from which these actions spring. As expressed in a sutta: "When a noble
disciple understands what is kammically unwholesome, and the root of unwholesome
kamma, what is kammically wholesome, and the root of wholesome kamma, then he
has right view."8

<!--l. 1852--><p class="indent" >   (i) Taking these points in order, we find that kamma is first distinguished as
unwholesome (akusala) and wholesome (kusala). Unwholesome kamma is action that
is morally blameworthy, detrimental to spiritual development, and conducive to
suffering for oneself and others. Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action that
is morally commendable, helpful to spiritual growth, and productive of benefits for
oneself and others.
<!--l. 1859--><p class="indent" >   (ii) Innumerable instances of unwholesome and wholesome kamma can be
cited, but the Buddha selects ten of each as primary. These he calls the ten
courses of unwholesome and wholesome action. Among the ten in the two sets,
three are bodily, four are verbal, and three are mental. The ten courses of
unwholesome kamma may be listed as follows, divided by way of their doors of
expression:
<!--l. 1866--><p class="indent" >   Destroying life
<!--l. 1868--><p class="indent" >   Taking what is not given
<!--l. 1870--><p class="indent" >   Wrong conduct in regard to sense pleasures
<!--l. 1872--><p class="indent" >   Verbal action:
<!--l. 1874--><p class="indent" >   False speech
<!--l. 1876--><p class="indent" >   Slanderous speech
<!--l. 1878--><p class="indent" >   Harsh speech (vacikamma)
<!--l. 1880--><p class="indent" >   Idle chatter
<!--l. 1882--><p class="indent" >   Covetousness
<!--l. 1884--><p class="indent" >   Ill will
<!--l. 1886--><p class="indent" >   Wrong view
<!--l. 1888--><p class="indent" >   The ten courses of wholesome kamma are the opposites of these: abstaining from
the first seven courses of unwholesome kamma, being free from covetousness and ill
will, and holding right view. Though the seven cases of abstinence are exercised
entirely by the mind and do not necessarily entail overt action, they are still
designated wholesome bodily and verbal action because they center on the control of
the faculties of body and speech.
<!--l. 1896--><p class="indent" >   (iii) Actions are distinguished as wholesome and unwholesome on the basis of
their underlying motives, called "roots" (mula), which impart their moral quality to
the volitions concomitant with themselves. Thus kamma is wholesome or
unwholesome according to whether its roots are wholesome or unwholesome.
The roots are threefold for each set. The unwholesome roots are the three
defilements we already mentioned &#8212; greed, aversion, and delusion. Any action
originating from these is an unwholesome kamma. The three wholesome roots are
their opposites, expressed negatively in the old Indian fashion as non-greed
(alobha), non-aversion (adosa), and non-delusion (amoha). Though these are
negatively designated, they signify not merely the absence of defilements but the
corresponding virtues. Non-greed implies renunciation, detachment, and generosity;
non-aversion implies loving-kindness, sympathy, and gentleness; and non-delusion
implies wisdom. Any action originating from these roots is a wholesome
kamma.
<!--l. 1912--><p class="indent" >   The most important feature of kamma is its capacity to produce results
corresponding to the ethical quality of the action. An immanent universal law holds
sway over volitional actions, bringing it about that these actions issue in retributive

consequences, called vipaka, "ripenings," or phala, "fruits." The law connecting
actions with their fruits works on the simple principle that unwholesome actions
ripen in suffering, wholesome actions in happiness. The ripening need not come right
away; it need not come in the present life at all. Kamma can operate across the
succession of lifetimes; it can even remain dormant for aeons into the future. But
whenever we perform a volitional action, the volition leaves its imprint on the mental
continuum, where it remains as a stored up potency. When the stored up
kamma meets with conditions favorable to its maturation, it awakens from its
dormant state and triggers off some effect that brings due compensation
for the original action. The ripening may take place in the present life, in
the next life, or in some life subsequent to the next. A kamma may ripen
by producing rebirth into the next existence, thus determining the basic
form of life; or it may ripen in the course of a lifetime, issuing in our varied
experiences of happiness and pain, success and failure, progress and decline. But
whenever it ripens and in whatever way, the same principle invariably holds:
wholesome actions yield favorable results, unwholesome actions yield unfavorable
results.
<!--l. 1936--><p class="indent" >   To recognize this principle is to hold right view of the mundane kind. This view at
once excludes the multiple forms of wrong view with which it is incompatible. As it
affirms that our actions have an influence on our destiny continuing into future lives,
it opposes the nihilistic view which regards this life as our only existence and holds
that consciousness terminates with death. As it grounds the distinction between good
and evil, right and wrong, in an objective universal principle, it opposes the
ethical subjectivism which asserts that good and evil are only postulations of
personal opinion or means to social control. As it affirms that people can
choose their actions freely, within limits set by their conditions, it opposes
the "hard deterministic" line that our choices are always made subject to
necessitation, and hence that free volition is unreal and moral responsibility
untenable.
<!--l. 1951--><p class="indent" >   Some of the implications of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching on the right view of kamma
and its fruits run counter to popular trends in present-day thought, and it is helpful
to make these differences explicit. The teaching on right view makes it known that
good and bad, right and wrong, transcend conventional opinions about what is good
and bad, what is right and wrong. An entire society may be predicated upon a
confusion of correct moral values, and even though everyone within that society may
applaud one particular kind of action as right and condemn another kind as wrong,
this does not make them validly right and wrong. For the Buddha moral
standards are objective and invariable. While the moral character of deeds is
doubtlessly conditioned by the circumstances under which they are performed,
there are objective criteria of morality against which any action, or any
comprehensive moral code, can be evaluated. This objective standard of morality
is integral to the Dhamma, the cosmic law of truth and righteousness. Its
transpersonal ground of validation is the fact that deeds, as expressions of the
volitions that engender them, produce consequences for the agent, and that
the correlations between deeds and their consequences are intrinsic to the
volitions themselves. There is no divine judge standing above the cosmic process

who assigns rewards and punishments. Nevertheless, the deeds themselves,
through their inherent moral or immoral nature, generate the appropriate
results.
<!--l. 1974--><p class="indent" >   For most people, the vast majority, the right view of kamma and its results is held
out of confidence, accepted on faith from an eminent spiritual teacher who proclaims
the moral efficacy of action. But even when the principle of kamma is not personally
seen, it still remains a facet of right view. It is part and parcel of right view because
right view is concerned with understanding &#8212; with understanding our place in the
total scheme of things &#8212; and one who accepts the principle that our volitional
actions possess a moral potency has, to that extent, grasped an important fact
pertaining to the nature of our existence. However, the right view of the
kammic efficacy of action need not remain exclusively an article of belief
screened behind an impenetrable barrier. It can become a matter of direct
seeing. Through the attainment of certain states of deep concentration it is
possible to develop a special faculty called the "divine eye" (dibbacakkhu),
a super-sensory power of vision that reveals things hidden from the eyes
of flesh. When this faculty is developed, it can be directed out upon the
world of living beings to investigate the workings of the kammic law. With
the special vision it confers one can then see for oneself, with immediate
perception, how beings pass away and re-arise according to their kamma, how they
meet happiness and suffering through the maturation of their good and evil
deeds.9
<!--l. 1997--><p class="indent" >   Superior Right View
<!--l. 1999--><p class="indent" >   The right view of kamma and its fruits provides a rationale for engaging in
wholesome actions and attaining high status within the round of rebirths, but by
itself it does not lead to liberation. It is possible for someone to accept the law of
kamma yet still limit his aims to mundane achievements. One&#8217;s motive for performing
noble deeds might be the accumulation of meritorious kamma leading to prosperity
and success here and now, a fortunate rebirth as a human being, or the enjoyment of
celestial bliss in the heavenly worlds. There is nothing within the logic of kammic
causality to impel the urge to transcend the cycle of kamma and its fruit. The
impulse to deliverance from the entire round of becoming depends upon the
acquisition of a different and deeper perspective, one which yields insight into
the inherent defectiveness of all forms of samsaric existence, even the most
exalted.
<!--l. 2013--><p class="indent" >   This superior right view leading to liberation is the understanding of the Four
Noble Truths. It is this right view that figures as the first factor of the Noble
Eightfold Path in the proper sense: as the noble right view. Thus the Buddha defines
the path factor of right view expressly in terms of the four truths: "What now is right
view? It is understanding of suffering (dukkha), understanding of the origin of
suffering, understanding of the cessation of suffering, understanding of the
way leading to the cessation to suffering."10 The Eightfold Path starts with
a conceptual understanding of the Four Noble Truths apprehended only
obscurely through the media of thought and reflection. It reaches its climax in a
direct intuition of those same truths, penetrated with a clarity tantamount to
enlightenment. Thus it can be said that the right view of the Four Noble

Truths forms both the beginning and the culmination of the way to the end of
suffering.
<!--l. 2028--><p class="indent" >   The first noble truth is the truth of suffering (dukkha), the inherent
unsatisfactoriness of existence, revealed in the impermanence, pain, and perpetual
incompleteness intrinsic to all forms of life.
<!--l. 2032--><p class="indent" >   This is the noble truth of suffering. Birth is suffering; aging is suffering; sickness is
suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are
suffering; association with the unpleasant is suffering; separation from the pleasant is
suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates of
clinging are suffering.11
<!--l. 2039--><p class="indent" >   The last statement makes a comprehensive claim that calls for some attention.
The five aggregates of clinging (pacupadanakkandha) are a classificatory scheme for
understanding the nature of our being. What we are, the Buddha teaches, is a set of
five aggregates &#8212; material form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and
consciousness &#8212; all connected with clinging. We are the five and the five
are us. Whatever we identify with, whatever we hold to as our self, falls
within the set of five aggregates. Together these five aggregates generate the
whole array of thoughts, emotions, ideas, and dispositions in which we dwell,
"our world." Thus the Buddha&#8217;s declaration that the five aggregates are
dukkha in effect brings all experience, our entire existence, into the range of
dukkha.
<!--l. 2053--><p class="indent" >   But here the question arises: Why should the Buddha say that the five aggregates
are dukkha? The reason he says that the five aggregates are dukkha is that they are
impermanent. They change from moment to moment, arise and fall away, without
anything substantial behind them persisting through the change. Since the
constituent factors of our being are always changing, utterly devoid of a permanent
core, there is nothing we can cling to in them as a basis for security. There is only a
constantly disintegrating flux which, when clung to in the desire for permanence,
brings a plunge into suffering.
<!--l. 2063--><p class="indent" >   The second noble truth points out the cause of dukkha. From the set of
defilements which eventuate in suffering, the Buddha singles out craving (tanha) as
the dominant and most pervasive cause, "the origin of suffering."
<!--l. 2068--><p class="indent" >   This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. It is this craving which produces
repeated existence, is bound up with delight and lust, and seeks pleasure here and
there, namely, craving for sense pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for
non-existence.12
<!--l. 2073--><p class="indent" >   The third noble truth simply reverses this relationship of origination. If craving is
the cause of dukkha, then to be free from dukkha we have to eliminate craving. Thus
the Buddha says:
<!--l. 2077--><p class="indent" >   This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. It is the complete fading away
and cessation of this craving, its forsaking and abandonment, liberation and
detachment from it.13
<!--l. 2081--><p class="indent" >   The state of perfect peace that comes when craving is eliminated is
Nibbana(nirvana), the unconditioned state experienced while alive with the
extinguishing of the flames of greed, aversion, and delusion. The fourth noble truth
shows the way to reach the end of dukkha, the way to the realization of Nibbana.

That way is the Noble Eightfold Path itself.
<!--l. 2088--><p class="indent" >   The right view of the Four Noble Truths develops in two stages. The first is called
the right view that accords with the truths (saccanulomika samma ditthi); the
second, the right view that penetrates the truths (saccapativedha samma ditthi). To
acquire the right view that accords with the truths requires a clear understanding of
their meaning and significance in our lives. Such an understanding arises first by
learning the truths and studying them. Subsequently it is deepened by reflecting
upon them in the light of experience until one gains a strong conviction as to their
veracity.
<!--l. 2098--><p class="indent" >   But even at this point the truths have not been penetrated, and thus the
understanding achieved is still defective, a matter of concept rather than
perception. To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to
take up the practice of meditation &#8212; first to strengthen the capacity for
sustained concentration, then to develop insight. Insight arises by contemplating
the five aggregates, the factors of existence, in order to discern their real
characteristics. At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye turns away
from the conditioned phenomena comprised in the aggregates and shifts
its focus to the unconditioned state, Nibbana, which becomes accessible
through the deepened faculty of insight. With this shift, when the mind&#8217;s
eye sees Nibbana, there takes place a simultaneous penetration of all Four
Noble Truths. By seeing Nibbana, the state beyond dukkha, one gains a
perspective from which to view the five aggregates and see that they are dukkha
simply because they are conditioned, subject to ceaseless change. At the same
moment Nibbana is realized, craving stops; the understanding then dawns that
craving is the true origin of dukkha. When Nibbana is seen, it is realized to be
the state of peace, free from the turmoil of becoming. And because this
experience has been reached by practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, one knows
for oneself that the Noble Eightfold Path is truly the way to the end of
dukkha.
<!--l. 2121--><p class="indent" >   This right view that penetrates the Four Noble Truths comes at the end of the
path, not at the beginning. We have to start with the right view conforming to the
truths, acquired through learning and fortified through reflection. This view inspires
us to take up the practice, to embark on the threefold training in moral
discipline, concentration, and wisdom. When the training matures, the eye of
wisdom opens by itself, penetrating the truths and freeing the mind from
bondage.
<!--l. 2129--><p class="indent" >   Chapter III: Right Intention (Samma Sankappa)
<!--l. 2131--><p class="indent" >   The second factor of the path is called in Pali samma sankappa, which we will
translate as "right intention." The term is sometimes translated as "right thought," a
rendering that can be accepted if we add the proviso that in the present
context the word "thought" refers specifically to the purposive or conative
aspect of mental activity, the cognitive aspect being covered by the first
factor, right view. It would be artificial, however, to insist too strongly on the
division between these two functions. From the Buddhist perspective, the
cognitive and purposive sides of the mind do not remain isolated in separate
compartments but intertwine and interact in close correlation. Emotional

predilections influence views, and views determine predilections. Thus a penetrating
view of the nature of existence, gained through deep reflection and validated
through investigation, brings with it a restructuring of values which sets
the mind moving towards goals commensurate with the new vision. The
application of mind needed to achieve those goals is what is meant by right
intention.
<!--l. 2149--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha explains right intention as threefold: the intention of renunciation,
the intention of good will, and the intention of harmlessness.14 The three are
opposed to three parallel kinds of wrong intention: intention governed by desire,
intention governed by ill will, and intention governed by harmfulness.15 Each kind of
right intention counters the corresponding kind of wrong intention. The intention of
renunciation counters the intention of desire, the intention of good will counters the
intention of ill will, and the intention of harmlessness counters the intention of
harmfulness.
<!--l. 2159--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha discovered this twofold division of thought in the period prior to his
Enlightenment (see MN 19). While he was striving for deliverance, meditating in the
forest, he found that his thoughts could be distributed into two different classes. In
one he put thoughts of desire, ill will, and harmfulness, in the other thoughts of
renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. Whenever he noticed thoughts of the first
kind arise in him, he understood that those thoughts lead to harm for oneself
and others, obstruct wisdom, and lead away from Nibbana. Reflecting in
this way he expelled such thoughts from his mind and brought them to an
end. But whenever thoughts of the second kind arose, he understood those
thoughts to be beneficial, conducive to the growth of wisdom, aids to the
attainment of Nibbana. Thus he strengthened those thoughts and brought them to
completion.
<!--l. 2173--><p class="indent" >   Right intention claims the second place in the path, between right view and the
triad of moral factors that begins with right speech, because the mind&#8217;s intentional
function forms the crucial link connecting our cognitive perspective with our modes
of active engagement in the world. On the one side actions always point back to
the thoughts from which they spring. Thought is the forerunner of action,
directing body and speech, stirring them into activity, using them as its
instruments for expressing its aims and ideals. These aims and ideals, our
intentions, in turn point back a further step to the prevailing views. When wrong
views prevail, the outcome is wrong intention giving rise to unwholesome
actions. Thus one who denies the moral efficacy of action and measures
achievement in terms of gain and status will aspire to nothing but gain and status,
using whatever means he can to acquire them. When such pursuits become
widespread, the result is suffering, the tremendous suffering of individuals,
social groups, and nations out to gain wealth, position, and power without
regard for consequences. The cause for the endless competition, conflict,
injustice, and oppression does not lie outside the mind. These are all just
manifestations of intentions, outcroppings of thoughts driven by greed, by hatred, by
delusion.
<!--l. 2193--><p class="indent" >   But when the intentions are right, the actions will be right, and for the intentions
to be right the surest guarantee is right views. One who recognizes the law of kamma,

that actions bring retributive consequences, will frame his pursuits to accord with
this law; thus his actions, expressive of his intentions, will conform to the canons of
right conduct. The Buddha succinctly sums up the matter when he says that for a
person who holds a wrong view, his deeds, words, plans, and purposes grounded in
that view will lead to suffering, while for a person who holds right view,
his deeds, words, plans, and purposes grounded in that view will lead to
happiness.16
<!--l. 2204--><p class="indent" >   Since the most important formulation of right view is the understanding of the
Four Noble Truths, it follows that this view should be in some way determinative of
the content of right intention. This we find to be in fact the case. Understanding the
four truths in relation to one&#8217;s own life gives rise to the intention of renunciation;
understanding them in relation to other beings gives rise to the other two right
intentions. When we see how our own lives are pervaded by dukkha, and how
this dukkha derives from craving, the mind inclines to renunciation &#8212; to
abandoning craving and the objects to which it binds us. Then, when we apply the
truths in an analogous way to other living beings, the contemplation nurtures
the growth of good will and harmlessness. We see that, like ourselves, all
other living beings want to be happy, and again that like ourselves they are
subject to suffering. The consideration that all beings seek happiness causes
thoughts of good will to arise &#8212; the loving wish that they be well, happy, and
peaceful. The consideration that beings are exposed to suffering causes thoughts
of harmlessness to arise &#8212; the compassionate wish that they be free from
suffering.
<!--l. 2223--><p class="indent" >   The moment the cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path begins, the factors of
right view and right intention together start to counteract the three unwholesome
roots. Delusion, the primary cognitive defilement, is opposed by right view, the
nascent seed of wisdom. The complete eradication of delusion will only take place
when right view is developed to the stage of full realization, but every flickering of
correct understanding contributes to its eventual destruction. The other two roots,
being emotive defilements, require opposition through the redirecting of intention,
and thus meet their antidotes in thoughts of renunciation, good will, and
harmlessness.
<!--l. 2234--><p class="indent" >   Since greed and aversion are deeply grounded, they do not yield easily; however,
the work of overcoming them is not impossible if an effective strategy is employed.
The path devised by the Buddha makes use of an indirect approach: it proceeds by
tackling the thoughts to which these defilements give rise. Greed and aversion surface
in the form of thoughts, and thus can be eroded by a process of "thought
substitution," by replacing them with the thoughts opposed to them. The intention
of renunciation provides the remedy to greed. Greed comes to manifestation in
thoughts of desire &#8212; as sensual, acquisitive, and possessive thoughts. Thoughts of
renunciation spring from the wholesome root of non-greed, which they activate
whenever they are cultivated. Since contrary thoughts cannot coexist, when thoughts
of renunciation are roused, they dislodge thoughts of desire, thus causing non-greed
to replace greed. Similarly, the intentions of good will and harmlessness
offer the antidote to aversion. Aversion comes to manifestation either in
thoughts of ill will &#8212; as angry, hostile, or resentful thoughts; or in thoughts of

harming &#8212; as the impulses to cruelty, aggression, and destruction. Thoughts of
good will counter the former outflow of aversion, thoughts of harmlessness
the latter outflow, in this way excising the unwholesome root of aversion
itself.
<!--l. 2256--><p class="indent" >   The Intention of Renunciation
<!--l. 2258--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha describes his teaching as running contrary to the way of the world.
The way of the world is the way of desire, and the unenlightened who follow this way
flow with the current of desire, seeking happiness by pursuing the objects in which
they imagine they will find fulfillment. The Buddha&#8217;s message of renunciation states
exactly the opposite: the pull of desire is to be resisted and eventually abandoned.
Desire is to be abandoned not because it is morally evil but because it is a root of
suffering.17 Thus renunciation, turning away from craving and its drive for
gratification, becomes the key to happiness, to freedom from the hold of
attachment.
<!--l. 2269--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha does not demand that everyone leave the household life for the
monastery or ask his followers to discard all sense enjoyments on the spot. The
degree to which a person renounces depends on his or her disposition and situation.
But what remains as a guiding principle is this: that the attainment of deliverance
requires the complete eradication of craving, and progress along the path is
accelerated to the extent that one overcomes craving. Breaking free from
domination by desire may not be easy, but the difficulty does not abrogate the
necessity. Since craving is the origin of dukkha, putting an end to dukkha
depends on eliminating craving, and that involves directing the mind to
renunciation.
<!--l. 2281--><p class="indent" >   But it is just at this point, when one tries to let go of attachment, that one
encounters a powerful inner resistance. The mind does not want to relinquish its hold
on the objects to which it has become attached. For such a long time it has
been accustomed to gaining, grasping, and holding, that it seems impossible
to break these habits by an act of will. One might agree to the need for
renunciation, might want to leave attachment behind, but when the call is
actually sounded the mind recoils and continues to move in the grip of its
desires.
<!--l. 2290--><p class="indent" >   So the problem arises of how to break the shackles of desire. The Buddha does
not offer as a solution the method of repression &#8212; the attempt to drive desire away
with a mind full of fear and loathing. This approach does not resolve the problem
but only pushes it below the surface, where it continues to thrive. The tool
the Buddha holds out to free the mind from desire is understanding. Real
renunciation is not a matter of compelling ourselves to give up things still inwardly
cherished, but of changing our perspective on them so that they no longer
bind us. When we understand the nature of desire, when we investigate
it closely with keen attention, desire falls away by itself, without need for
struggle.
<!--l. 2302--><p class="indent" >   To understand desire in such a way that we can loosen its hold, we need to see
that desire is invariably bound up with dukkha. The whole phenomenon of desire,
with its cycle of wanting and gratification, hangs on our way of seeing things. We
remain in bondage to desire because we see it as our means to happiness. If we can

look at desire from a different angle, its force will be abated, resulting in the
move towards renunciation. What is needed to alter perception is something
called "wise consideration" (yoniso manasikara). Just as perception influences
thought, so thought can influence perception. Our usual perceptions are
tinged with "unwise consideration" (ayoniso manasikara). We ordinarily
look only at the surfaces of things, scan them in terms of our immediate
interests and wants; only rarely do we dig into the roots of our involvements or
explore their long-range consequences. To set this straight calls for wise
consideration: looking into the hidden undertones to our actions, exploring
their results, evaluating the worthiness of our goals. In this investigation our
concern must not be with what is pleasant but with what is true. We have to
be prepared and willing to discover what is true even at the cost of our
comfort. For real security always lies on the side of truth, not on the side of
comfort.
<!--l. 2323--><p class="indent" >   When desire is scrutinized closely, we find that it is constantly shadowed by
dukkha. Sometimes dukkha appears as pain or irritation; often it lies low as a
constant strain of discontent. But the two &#8212; desire and dukkha &#8212; are inseparable
concomitants. We can confirm this for ourselves by considering the whole cycle of
desire. At the moment desire springs up it creates in us a sense of lack, the
pain of want. To end this pain we struggle to fulfill the desire. If our effort
fails, we experience frustration, disappointment, sometimes despair. But
even the pleasure of success is not unqualified. We worry that we might
lose the ground we have gained. We feel driven to secure our position, to
safeguard our territory, to gain more, to rise higher, to establish tighter
controls. The demands of desire seem endless, and each desire demands the
eternal: it wants the things we get to last forever. But all the objects of
desire are impermanent. Whether it be wealth, power, position, or other
persons, separation is inevitable, and the pain that accompanies separation is
proportional to the force of attachment: strong attachment brings much
suffering; little attachment brings little suffering; no attachment brings no
suffering.18
<!--l. 2343--><p class="indent" >   Contemplating the dukkha inherent in desire is one way to incline the mind to
renunciation. Another way is to contemplate directly the benefits flowing from
renunciation. To move from desire to renunciation is not, as might be imagined, to
move from happiness to grief, from abundance to destitution. It is to pass from gross,
entangling pleasures to an exalted happiness and peace, from a condition of servitude
to one of self-mastery. Desire ultimately breeds fear and sorrow, but renunciation
gives fearlessness and joy. It promotes the accomplishment of all three stages of the
threefold training: it purifies conduct, aids concentration, and nourishes the seed of
wisdom. The entire course of practice from start to finish can in fact be seen as an
evolving process of renunciation culminating in Nibbana as the ultimate
stage of relinquishment, "the relinquishing of all foundations of existence"
(sabb&#8217;upadhipatinissagga).
<!--l. 2358--><p class="indent" >   When we methodically contemplate the dangers of desire and the benefits of
renunciation, gradually we steer our mind away from the domination of desire.
Attachments are shed like the leaves of a tree, naturally and spontaneously. The

changes do not come suddenly, but when there is persistent practice, there is no
doubt that they will come. Through repeated contemplation one thought
knocks away another, the intention of renunciation dislodges the intention of
desire.
<!--l. 2366--><p class="indent" >   The Intention of Good Will
<!--l. 2368--><p class="indent" >   The intention of good will opposes the intention of ill will, thoughts governed by
anger and aversion. As in the case of desire, there are two ineffective ways of handling
ill will. One is to yield to it, to express the aversion by bodily or verbal action. This
approach releases the tension, helps drive the anger "out of one&#8217;s system," but it also
poses certain dangers. It breeds resentment, provokes retaliation, creates enemies,
poisons relationships, and generates unwholesome kamma; in the end, the ill will does
not leave the "system" after all, but instead is driven down to a deeper level where
it continues to vitiate one&#8217;s thoughts and conduct. The other approach,
repression, also fails to dispel the destructive force of ill will. It merely turns that
force around and pushes it inward, where it becomes transmogrified into
self-contempt, chronic depression, or a tendency to irrational outbursts of
violence.
<!--l. 2384--><p class="indent" >   The remedy the Buddha recommends to counteract ill will, especially when the
object is another person, is a quality called in Pali metta. This word derives from
another word meaning "friend," but metta signifies much more than ordinary
friendliness. I prefer to translate it by the compound "loving-kindness," which best
captures the intended sense: an intense feeling of selfless love for other beings
radiating outwards as a heartfelt concern for their well-being and happiness.
Metta is not just sentimental good will, nor is it a conscientious response to a
moral imperative or divine command. It must become a deep inner feeling,
characterized by spontaneous warmth rather than by a sense of obligation. At its
peak metta rises to the heights of a brahmavihara, a "divine dwelling," a
total way of being centered on the radiant wish for the welfare of all living
beings.
<!--l. 2399--><p class="indent" >   The kind of love implied by metta should be distinguished from sensual love as
well as from the love involved in personal affection. The first is a form of craving,
necessarily self-directed, while the second still includes a degree of attachment: we
love a person because that person gives us pleasure, belongs to our family
or group, or reinforces our own self-image. Only rarely does the feeling of
affection transcend all traces of ego-reference, and even then its scope is
limited. It applies only to a certain person or group of people while excluding
others.
<!--l. 2409--><p class="indent" >   The love involved in metta, in contrast, does not hinge on particular relations to
particular persons. Here the reference point of self is utterly omitted. We are
concerned only with suffusing others with a mind of loving-kindness, which ideally is
to be developed into a universal state, extended to all living beings without
discriminations or reservations. The way to impart to metta this universal scope is to
cultivate it as an exercise in meditation. Spontaneous feelings of good will occur too
sporadically and are too limited in range to be relied on as the remedy for aversion.
The idea of deliberately developing love has been criticized as contrived, mechanical,
and calculated. Love, it is said, can only be genuine when it is spontaneous, arisen

without inner prompting or effort. But it is a Buddhist thesis that the mind cannot
be commanded to love spontaneously; it can only be shown the means to
develop love and enjoined to practice accordingly. At first the means has to be
employed with some deliberation, but through practice the feeling of love
becomes ingrained, grafted onto the mind as a natural and spontaneous
tendency.
<!--l. 2427--><p class="indent" >   The method of development is metta-bhavana, the meditation on loving-kindness,
one of the most important kinds of Buddhist meditation. The meditation begins with
the development of loving-kindness towards oneself.19 It is suggested that one take
oneself as the first object of metta because true loving-kindness for others only
becomes possible when one is able to feel genuine loving-kindness for oneself.
Probably most of the anger and hostility we direct to others springs from
negative attitudes we hold towards ourselves. When metta is directed inwards
towards oneself, it helps to melt down the hardened crust created by these
negative attitudes, permitting a fluid diffusion of kindness and sympathy
outwards.
<!--l. 2439--><p class="indent" >   Once one has learned to kindle the feeling of metta towards oneself, the next step
is to extend it to others. The extension of metta hinges on a shift in the sense of
identity, on expanding the sense of identity beyond its ordinary confines and learning
to identify with others. The shift is purely psychological in method, entirely free from
theological and metaphysical postulates, such as that of a universal self
immanent in all beings. Instead, it proceeds from a simple, straightforward
course of reflection which enables us to share the subjectivity of others and
experience the world (at least imaginatively) from the standpoint of their own
inwardness. The procedure starts with oneself. If we look into our own mind,
we find that the basic urge of our being is the wish to be happy and free
from suffering. Now, as soon as we see this in ourselves, we can immediately
understand that all living beings share the same basic wish. All want to be well,
happy, and secure. To develop metta towards others, what is to be done is to
imaginatively share their own innate wish for happiness. We use our own
desire for happiness as the key, experience this desire as the basic urge of
others, then come back to our own position and extend to them the wish
that they may achieve their ultimate objective, that they may be well and
happy.
<!--l. 2460--><p class="indent" >   The methodical radiation of metta is practiced first by directing metta to
individuals representing certain groups. These groups are set in an order of
progressive remoteness from oneself. The radiation begins with a dear person, such as
a parent or teacher, then moves on to a friend, then to a neutral person, then finally
to a hostile person. Though the types are defined by their relation to oneself,
the love to be developed is not based on that relation but on each person&#8217;s
common aspiration for happiness. With each individual one has to bring
his (or her) image into focus and radiate the thought: "May he (she) be
well! May he (she) be happy! May he (she) be peaceful!"20 Only when one
succeeds in generating a warm feeling of good will and kindness towards
that person should one turn to the next. Once one gains some success with
individuals, one can then work with larger units. One can try developing metta

towards all friends, all neutral persons, all hostile persons. Then metta can be
widened by directional suffusion, proceeding in the various directions &#8212; east,
south, west, north, above, below &#8212; then it can be extended to all beings
without distinction. In the end one suffuses the entire world with a mind of
loving-kindness "vast, sublime, and immeasurable, without enmity, without
aversion."
<!--l. 2481--><p class="indent" >   The Intention of Harmlessness
<!--l. 2483--><p class="indent" >   The intention of harmlessness is thought guided by compassion (karuna), aroused
in opposition to cruel, aggressive, and violent thoughts. Compassion supplies the
complement to loving-kindness. Whereas loving-kindness has the characteristic of
wishing for the happiness and welfare of others, compassion has the characteristic of
wishing that others be free from suffering, a wish to be extended without limits to all
living beings. Like metta, compassion arises by entering into the subjectivity of
others, by sharing their interiority in a deep and total way. It springs up by
considering that all beings, like ourselves, wish to be free from suffering, yet despite
their wishes continue to be harassed by pain, fear, sorrow, and other forms of
dukkha.
<!--l. 2495--><p class="indent" >   To develop compassion as a meditative exercise, it is most effective to start with
somebody who is actually undergoing suffering, since this provides the natural object
for compassion. One contemplates this person&#8217;s suffering, either directly
or imaginatively, then reflects that like oneself, he (she) also wants to be
free from suffering. The thought should be repeated, and contemplation
continually exercised, until a strong feeling of compassion swells up in the heart.
Then, using that feeling as a standard, one turns to different individuals,
considers how they are each exposed to suffering, and radiates the gentle
feeling of compassion out to them. To increase the breadth and intensity of
compassion it is helpful to contemplate the various sufferings to which living
beings are susceptible. A useful guideline to this extension is provided by the
first noble truth, with its enumeration of the different aspects of dukkha.
One contemplates beings as subject to old age, then as subject to sickness,
then to death, then to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, and so
forth.
<!--l. 2512--><p class="indent" >   When a high level of success has been achieved in generating compassion by the
contemplation of beings who are directly afflicted by suffering, one can then move on
to consider people who are presently enjoying happiness which they have
acquired by immoral means. One might reflect that such people, despite
their superficial fortune, are doubtlessly troubled deep within by the pangs
of conscience. Even if they display no outward signs of inner distress, one
knows that they will eventually reap the bitter fruits of their evil deeds,
which will bring them intense suffering. Finally, one can widen the scope of
one&#8217;s contemplation to include all living beings. One should contemplate all
beings as subject to the universal suffering of samsara, driven by their greed,
aversion, and delusion through the round of repeated birth and death. If
compassion is initially difficult to arouse towards beings who are total strangers,
one can strengthen it by reflecting on the Buddha&#8217;s dictum that in this
beginningless cycle of rebirths, it is hard to find even a single being who has not

at some time been one&#8217;s own mother or father, sister or brother, son or
daughter.
<!--l. 2530--><p class="indent" >   To sum up, we see that the three kinds of right intention &#8212; of renunciation, good
will, and harmlessness &#8212; counteract the three wrong intentions of desire, ill will, and
harmfulness. The importance of putting into practice the contemplations leading to
the arising of these thoughts cannot be overemphasized. The contemplations have
been taught as methods for cultivation, not mere theoretical excursions. To develop
the intention of renunciation we have to contemplate the suffering tied up with
the quest for worldly enjoyment; to develop the intention of good will we
have to consider how all beings desire happiness; to develop the intention
of harmlessness we have to consider how all beings wish to be free from
suffering. The unwholesome thought is like a rotten peg lodged in the mind;
the wholesome thought is like a new peg suitable to replace it. The actual
contemplation functions as the hammer used to drive out the old peg with
the new one. The work of driving in the new peg is practice &#8212; practicing
again and again, as often as is necessary to reach success. The Buddha gives
us his assurance that the victory can be achieved. He says that whatever
one reflects upon frequently becomes the inclination of the mind. If one
frequently thinks sensual, hostile, or harmful thoughts, desire, ill will, and
harmfulness become the inclination of the mind. If one frequently thinks in
the opposite way, renunciation, good will, and harmlessness become the
inclination of the mind (MN 19). The direction we take always comes back to
ourselves, to the intentions we generate moment by moment in the course of our
lives.
<!--l. 2555--><p class="indent" >   Chapter IV: Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood (Samma Vaca, Samma
Kammanta, Samma Ajiva)
<!--l. 2558--><p class="indent" >   The next three path factors &#8212; right speech, right action, and right livelihood &#8212;
may be treated together, as collectively they make up the first of the three divisions
of the path, the division of moral discipline (silakkhandha). Though the principles
laid down in this section restrain immoral actions and promote good conduct, their
ultimate purpose is not so much ethical as spiritual. They are not prescribed
merely as guides to action, but primarily as aids to mental purification. As a
necessary measure for human well-being, ethics has its own justification
in the Buddha&#8217;s teaching and its importance cannot be underrated. But
in the special context of the Noble Eightfold Path ethical principles are
subordinate to the path&#8217;s governing goal, final deliverance from suffering.
Thus for the moral training to become a proper part of the path, it has
to be taken up under the tutelage of the first two factors, right view and
right intention, and to lead beyond to the trainings in concentration and
wisdom.
<!--l. 2575--><p class="indent" >   Though the training in moral discipline is listed first among the three groups of
practices, it should not be regarded lightly. It is the foundation for the entire path,
essential for the success of the other trainings. The Buddha himself frequently
urged his disciples to adhere to the rules of discipline, "seeing danger in the
slightest fault." One time, when a monk approached the Buddha and asked
for the training in brief, the Buddha told him: "First establish yourself in

the starting point of wholesome states, that is, in purified moral discipline
and in right view. Then, when your moral discipline is purified and your
view straight, you should practice the four foundations of mindfulness" (SN
47:3).
<!--l. 2588--><p class="indent" >   The Pali word we have been translating as "moral discipline," sila, appears in the
texts with several overlapping meanings all connected with right conduct. In some
contexts it means action conforming to moral principles, in others the principles
themselves, in still others the virtuous qualities of character that result from the
observance of moral principles. Sila in the sense of precepts or principles represents
the formalistic side of the ethical training, sila as virtue the animating spirit, and sila
as right conduct the expression of virtue in real-life situations. Often sila is
formally defined as abstinence from unwholesome bodily and verbal action. This
definition, with its stress on outer action, appears superficial. Other explanations,
however, make up for the deficiency and reveal that there is more to sila than is
evident at first glance. The Abhidhamma, for example, equates sila with
the mental factors of abstinence (viratiyo) &#8212; right speech, right action,
and right livelihood &#8212; an equation which makes it clear that what is really
being cultivated through the observance of moral precepts is the mind. Thus
while the training in sila brings the "public" benefit of inhibiting socially
detrimental actions, it entails the personal benefit of mental purification,
preventing the defilements from dictating to us what lines of conduct we should
follow.
<!--l. 2610--><p class="indent" >   The English word "morality" and its derivatives suggest a sense of obligation and
constraint quite foreign to the Buddhist conception of sila; this connotation probably
enters from the theistic background to Western ethics. Buddhism, with its
non-theistic framework, grounds its ethics, not on the notion of obedience, but on
that of harmony. In fact, the commentaries explain the word sila by another word,
samadhana, meaning "harmony" or "coordination."
<!--l. 2619--><p class="indent" >   The observance of sila leads to harmony at several levels &#8212; social, psychological,
kammic, and contemplative. At the social level the principles of sila help to establish
harmonious interpersonal relations, welding the mass of differently constituted
members of society with their own private interests and goals into a cohesive social
order in which conflict, if not utterly eliminated, is at least reduced. At the
psychological level sila brings harmony to the mind, protection from the inner split
caused by guilt and remorse over moral transgressions. At the kammic level the
observance of sila ensures harmony with the cosmic law of kamma, hence
favorable results in the course of future movement through the round of
repeated birth and death. And at the fourth level, the contemplative, sila helps
establish the preliminary purification of mind to be completed, in a deeper
and more thorough way, by the methodical development of serenity and
insight.
<!--l. 2635--><p class="indent" >   When briefly defined, the factors of moral training are usually worded negatively,
in terms of abstinence. But there is more to sila than refraining from what is wrong.
Each principle embedded in the precepts, as we will see, actually has two aspects,
both essential to the training as a whole. One is abstinence from the unwholesome,
the other commitment to the wholesome; the former is called "avoidance" (varitta)

and the latter "performance" (caritta). At the outset of training the Buddha stresses
the aspect of avoidance. He does so, not because abstinence from the unwholesome is
sufficient in itself, but to establish the steps of practice in proper sequence. The
steps are set out in their natural order (more logical than temporal) in the
famous dictum of the Dhammapada: "To abstain from all evil, to cultivate the
good, and to purify one&#8217;s mind &#8212; this is the teaching of the Buddhas" (v.
183). The other two steps &#8212; cultivating the good and purifying the mind &#8212;
also receive their due, but to ensure their success, a resolve to avoid the
unwholesome is a necessity. Without such a resolve the attempt to develop
wholesome qualities is bound to issue in a warped and stunted pattern of
growth.
<!--l. 2655--><p class="indent" >   The training in moral discipline governs the two principal channels of outer
action, speech and body, as well as another area of vital concern &#8212; one&#8217;s way
of earning a living. Thus the training contains three factors: right speech,
right action, and right livelihood. These we will now examine individually,
following the order in which they are set forth in the usual exposition of the
path.
<!--l. 2662--><p class="indent" >   Right Speech (samma vaca)
<!--l. 2664--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha divides right speech into four components: abstaining from false
speech, abstaining from slanderous speech, abstaining from harsh speech, and
abstaining from idle chatter. Because the effects of speech are not as immediately
evident as those of bodily action, its importance and potential is easily overlooked.
But a little reflection will show that speech and its offshoot, the written word, can
have enormous consequences for good or for harm. In fact, whereas for beings such
as animals who live at the preverbal level physical action is of dominant
concern, for humans immersed in verbal communication speech gains the
ascendency. Speech can break lives, create enemies, and start wars, or it can give
wisdom, heal divisions, and create peace. This has always been so, yet in the
modern age the positive and negative potentials of speech have been vastly
multiplied by the tremendous increase in the means, speed, and range of
communications. The capacity for verbal expression, oral and written, has
often been regarded as the distinguishing mark of the human species. From
this we can appreciate the need to make this capacity the means to human
excellence rather than, as too often has been the case, the sign of human
degradation.
<!--l. 2683--><p class="indent" >   (1) Abstaining from false speech (musavada veramani)
<!--l. 2685--><p class="indent" >   Herein someone avoids false speech and abstains from it. He speaks the truth, is
devoted to truth, reliable, worthy of confidence, not a deceiver of people. Being
at a meeting, or amongst people, or in the midst of his relatives, or in a
society, or in the king&#8217;s court, and called upon and asked as witness to tell
what he knows, he answers, if he knows nothing: "I know nothing," and
if he knows, he answers: "I know"; if he has seen nothing, he answers: "I
have seen nothing," and if he has seen, he answers: "I have seen." Thus he
never knowingly speaks a lie, either for the sake of his own advantage, or for
the sake of another person&#8217;s advantage, or for the sake of any advantage
whatsoever.21

<!--l. 2698--><p class="indent" >   This statement of the Buddha discloses both the negative and the positive sides
to the precept. The negative side is abstaining from lying, the positive side speaking
the truth. The determinative factor behind the transgression is the intention to
deceive. If one speaks something false believing it to be true, there is no breach of the
precept as the intention to deceive is absent. Though the deceptive intention is
common to all cases of false speech, lies can appear in different guises depending
on the motivating root, whether greed, hatred, or delusion. Greed as the
chief motive results in the lie aimed at gaining some personal advantage for
oneself or for those close to oneself &#8212; material wealth, position, respect, or
admiration. With hatred as the motive, false speech takes the form of the
malicious lie, the lie intended to hurt and damage others. When delusion is the
principal motive, the result is a less pernicious type of falsehood: the irrational
lie, the compulsive lie, the interesting exaggeration, lying for the sake of a
joke.
<!--l. 2715--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha&#8217;s stricture against lying rests upon several reasons. For one thing,
lying is disruptive to social cohesion. People can live together in society only in an
atmosphere of mutual trust, where they have reason to believe that others will
speak the truth; by destroying the grounds for trust and inducing mass
suspicion, widespread lying becomes the harbinger signalling the fall from social
solidarity to chaos. But lying has other consequences of a deeply personal nature
at least equally disastrous. By their very nature lies tend to proliferate.
Lying once and finding our word suspect, we feel compelled to lie again to
defend our credibility, to paint a consistent picture of events. So the process
repeats itself: the lies stretch, multiply, and connect until they lock us into
a cage of falsehoods from which it is difficult to escape. The lie is thus a
miniature paradigm for the whole process of subjective illusion. In each case the
self-assured creator, sucked in by his own deceptions, eventually winds up their
victim.
<!--l. 2732--><p class="indent" >   Such considerations probably lie behind the words of counsel the Buddha spoke to
his son, the young novice Rahula, soon after the boy was ordained. One day the
Buddha came to Rahula, pointed to a bowl with a little bit of water in it, and asked:
"Rahula, do you see this bit of water left in the bowl?" Rahula answered: "Yes, sir."
"So little, Rahula, is the spiritual achievement (samaa, lit. &#8217;recluseship&#8217;) of one
who is not afraid to speak a deliberate lie." Then the Buddha threw the water
away, put the bowl down, and said: "Do you see, Rahula, how that water
has been discarded? In the same way one who tells a deliberate lie discards
whatever spiritual achievement he has made." Again he asked: "Do you see
how this bowl is now empty? In the same way one who has no shame in
speaking lies is empty of spiritual achievement." Then the Buddha turned the
bowl upside down and said: "Do you see, Rahula, how this bowl has been
turned upside down? In the same way one who tells a deliberate lie turns his
spiritual achievements upside down and becomes incapable of progress."
Therefore, the Buddha concluded, one should not speak a deliberate lie even in
jest.22
<!--l. 2753--><p class="indent" >   It is said that in the course of his long training for enlightenment over many lives,
a bodhisatta can break all the moral precepts except the pledge to speak the truth.

The reason for this is very profound, and reveals that the commitment to truth has a
significance transcending the domain of ethics and even mental purification, taking us
to the domains of knowledge and being. Truthful speech provides, in the sphere of
interpersonal communication, a parallel to wisdom in the sphere of private
understanding. The two are respectively the outward and inward modalities of
the same commitment to what is real. Wisdom consists in the realization
of truth, and truth (sacca) is not just a verbal proposition but the nature
of things as they are. To realize truth our whole being has to be brought
into accord with actuality, with things as they are, which requires that in
communications with others we respect things as they are by speaking the
truth. Truthful speech establishes a correspondence between our own inner
being and the real nature of phenomena, allowing wisdom to rise up and
fathom their real nature. Thus, much more than an ethical principle, devotion
to truthful speech is a matter of taking our stand on reality rather than
illusion, on the truth grasped by wisdom rather than the fantasies woven by
desire.
<!--l. 2774--><p class="indent" >   (2) Abstaining from slanderous speech (pisunaya vacaya veramani)
<!--l. 2776--><p class="indent" >   He avoids slanderous speech and abstains from it. What he has heard here he
does not repeat there, so as to cause dissension there; and what he has heard there he
does not repeat here, so as to cause dissension here. Thus he unites those that are
divided; and those that are united he encourages. Concord gladdens him, he
delights and rejoices in concord; and it is concord that he spreads by his
words.23
<!--l. 2783--><p class="indent" >   Slanderous speech is speech intended to create enmity and division, to alienate
one person or group from another. The motive behind such speech is generally
aversion, resentment of a rival&#8217;s success or virtues, the intention to tear down others
by verbal denigrations. Other motives may enter the picture as well: the cruel
intention of causing hurt to others, the evil desire to win affection for oneself, the
perverse delight in seeing friends divided.
<!--l. 2791--><p class="indent" >   Slanderous speech is one of the most serious moral transgressions. The root of
hate makes the unwholesome kamma already heavy enough, but since the action
usually occurs after deliberation, the negative force becomes even stronger because
premeditation adds to its gravity. When the slanderous statement is false, the two
wrongs of falsehood and slander combine to produce an extremely powerful
unwholesome kamma. The canonical texts record several cases in which the
calumny of an innocent party led to an immediate rebirth in the plane of
misery.
<!--l. 2800--><p class="indent" >   The opposite of slander, as the Buddha indicates, is speech that promotes
friendship and harmony. Such speech originates from a mind of loving-kindness and
sympathy. It wins the trust and affection of others, who feel they can confide in one
without fear that their disclosures will be used against them. Beyond the
obvious benefits that such speech brings in this present life, it is said that
abstaining from slander has as its kammic result the gain of a retinue of
friends who can never be turned against one by the slanderous words of
others.24
<!--l. 2809--><p class="indent" >   (3) Abstaining from harsh speech (pharusaya vacaya veramani).

<!--l. 2811--><p class="indent" >   He avoids harsh language and abstains from it. He speaks such words as are
gentle, soothing to the ear, loving, such words as go to the heart, and are courteous,
friendly, and agreeable to many.25
<!--l. 2815--><p class="indent" >   Harsh speech is speech uttered in anger, intended to cause the hearer
pain. Such speech can assume different forms, of which we might mention
three. One is abusive speech: scolding, reviling, or reproving another angrily
with bitter words. A second is insult: hurting another by ascribing to him
some offensive quality which detracts from his dignity. A third is sarcasm:
speaking to someone in a way which ostensibly lauds him, but with such a
tone or twist of phrasing that the ironic intent becomes clear and causes
pain.
<!--l. 2824--><p class="indent" >   The main root of harsh speech is aversion, assuming the form of anger. Since the
defilement in this case tends to work impulsively, without deliberation, the
transgression is less serious than slander and the kammic consequence generally less
severe. Still, harsh speech is an unwholesome action with disagreeable results for
oneself and others, both now and in the future, so it has to be restrained. The ideal
antidote is patience &#8212; learning to tolerate blame and criticism from others, to
sympathize with their shortcomings, to respect differences in viewpoint, to endure
abuse without feeling compelled to retaliate. The Buddha calls for patience even
under the most trying conditions:
<!--l. 2836--><p class="indent" >   Even if, monks, robbers and murderers saw through your limbs and joints,
whosoever should give way to anger thereat would not be following my advice. For
thus ought you to train yourselves: "Undisturbed shall our mind remain, with
heart full of love, and free from any hidden malice; and that person shall we
penetrate with loving thoughts, wide, deep, boundless, freed from anger and
hatred."26
<!--l. 2843--><p class="indent" >   (4) Abstaining from idle chatter (samphappalapa veramani).
<!--l. 2845--><p class="indent" >   He avoids idle chatter and abstains from it. He speaks at the right time, in
accordance with facts, speaks what is useful, speaks of the Dhamma and the
discipline; his speech is like a treasure, uttered at the right moment, accompanied by
reason, moderate and full of sense.27
<!--l. 2850--><p class="indent" >   Idle chatter is pointless talk, speech that lacks purpose or depth. Such
speech communicates nothing of value, but only stirs up the defilements in
one&#8217;s own mind and in others. The Buddha advises that idle talk should
be curbed and speech restricted as much as possible to matters of genuine
importance. In the case of a monk, the typical subject of the passage just quoted,
his words should be selective and concerned primarily with the Dhamma.
Lay persons will have more need for affectionate small talk with friends
and family, polite conversation with acquaintances, and talk in connection
with their line of work. But even then they should be mindful not to let the
conversation stray into pastures where the restless mind, always eager for
something sweet or spicy to feed on, might find the chance to indulge its defiling
propensities.
<!--l. 2863--><p class="indent" >   The traditional exegesis of abstaining from idle chatter refers only to avoiding
engagement in such talk oneself. But today it might be of value to give this factor a
different slant, made imperative by certain developments peculiar to our own time,

unknown in the days of the Buddha and the ancient commentators. This is avoiding
exposure to the idle chatter constantly bombarding us through the new media of
communication created by modern technology. An incredible array of devices
&#8212; television, radio, newspapers, pulp journals, the cinema &#8212; turns out a
continuous stream of needless information and distracting entertainment
the net effect of which is to leave the mind passive, vacant, and sterile. All
these developments, naively accepted as "progress," threaten to blunt our
aesthetic and spiritual sensitivities and deafen us to the higher call of the
contemplative life. Serious aspirants on the path to liberation have to be extremely
discerning in what they allow themselves to be exposed to. They would greatly
serve their aspirations by including these sources of amusement and needless
information in the category of idle chatter and making an effort to avoid
them.
<!--l. 2882--><p class="indent" >   Right Action (samma kammanta)
<!--l. 2884--><p class="indent" >   Right action means refraining from unwholesome deeds that occur with the body
as their natural means of expression. The pivotal element in this path factor is the
mental factor of abstinence, but because this abstinence applies to actions performed
through the body, it is called "right action." The Buddha mentions three components
of right action: abstaining from taking life, abstaining from taking what is not given,
and abstaining from sexual misconduct. These we will briefly discuss in
order.
<!--l. 2893--><p class="indent" >   (1) Abstaining from the taking of life (panatipata veramani)
<!--l. 2895--><p class="indent" >   Herein someone avoids the taking of life and abstains from it. Without stick or
sword, conscientious, full of sympathy, he is desirous of the welfare of all sentient
beings.28
<!--l. 2899--><p class="indent" >   "Abstaining from taking life" has a wider application than simply refraining from
killing other human beings. The precept enjoins abstaining from killing any sentient
being. A "sentient being" (pani, satta) is a living being endowed with mind or
consciousness; for practical purposes, this means human beings, animals, and insects.
Plants are not considered to be sentient beings; though they exhibit some degree of
sensitivity, they lack full-fledged consciousness, the defining attribute of a sentient
being.
<!--l. 2909--><p class="indent" >   The "taking of life" that is to be avoided is intentional killing, the deliberate
destruction of life of a being endowed with consciousness. The principle is grounded
in the consideration that all beings love life and fear death, that all seek happiness
and are averse to pain. The essential determinant of transgression is the volition to
kill, issuing in an action that deprives a being of life. Suicide is also generally
regarded as a violation, but not accidental killing as the intention to destroy life is
absent. The abstinence may be taken to apply to two kinds of action, the
primary and the secondary. The primary is the actual destruction of life; the
secondary is deliberately harming or torturing another being without killing
it.
<!--l. 2922--><p class="indent" >   While the Buddha&#8217;s statement on non-injury is quite simple and straightforward,
later commentaries give a detailed analysis of the principle. A treatise from Thailand,
written by an erudite Thai patriarch, collates a mass of earlier material into an
especially thorough treatment, which we shall briefly summarize here.29 The treatise

points out that the taking of life may have varying degrees of moral weight entailing
different consequences. The three primary variables governing moral weight are the
object, the motive, and the effort. With regard to the object there is a difference in
seriousness between killing a human being and killing an animal, the former
being kammically heavier since man has a more highly developed moral sense
and greater spiritual potential than animals. Among human beings, the
degree of kammic weight depends on the qualities of the person killed and his
relation to the killer; thus killing a person of superior spiritual qualities or a
personal benefactor, such as a parent or a teacher, is an especially grave
act.
<!--l. 2939--><p class="indent" >   The motive for killing also influences moral weight. Acts of killing can
be driven by greed, hatred, or delusion. Of the three, killing motivated by
hatred is the most serious, and the weight increases to the degree that the
killing is premeditated. The force of effort involved also contributes, the
unwholesome kamma being proportional to the force and the strength of the
defilements.
<!--l. 2946--><p class="indent" >   The positive counterpart to abstaining from taking life, as the Buddha indicates,
is the development of kindness and compassion for other beings. The disciple not only
avoids destroying life; he dwells with a heart full of sympathy, desiring the welfare of
all beings. The commitment to non-injury and concern for the welfare of others
represent the practical application of the second path factor, right intention, in the
form of good will and harmlessness.
<!--l. 2954--><p class="indent" >   (2) Abstaining from taking what is not given (adinnadana veramani)
<!--l. 2956--><p class="indent" >   He avoids taking what is not given and abstains from it; what another person
possesses of goods and chattel in the village or in the wood, that he does not take
away with thievish intent.30
<!--l. 2960--><p class="indent" >   "Taking what is not given" means appropriating the rightful belongings of others
with thievish intent. If one takes something that has no owner, such as unclaimed
stones, wood, or even gems extracted from the earth, the act does not count as a
violation even though these objects have not been given. But also implied as a
transgression, though not expressly stated, is withholding from others what should
rightfully be given to them.
<!--l. 2968--><p class="indent" >   Commentaries mention a number of ways in which "taking what is not given" can
be committed. Some of the most common may be enumerated:
<!--l. 2972--><p class="indent" >   (1) stealing: taking the belongings of others secretly, as in housebreaking,
pickpocketing, etc.;
<!--l. 2975--><p class="indent" >   (2) robbery: taking what belongs to others openly by force or threats;
<!--l. 2977--><p class="indent" >   (3) snatching: suddenly pulling away another&#8217;s possession before he has time to
resist;
<!--l. 2980--><p class="indent" >   (4) fraudulence: gaining possession of another&#8217;s belongings by falsely claiming
them as one&#8217;s own;
<!--l. 2983--><p class="indent" >   (5) deceitfulness: using false weights and measures to cheat customers.31
<!--l. 2985--><p class="indent" >   The degree of moral weight that attaches to the action is determined by three
factors: the value of the object taken; the qualities of the victim of the theft; and the
subjective state of the thief. Regarding the first, moral weight is directly
proportional to the value of the object. Regarding the second, the weight varies

according to the moral qualities of the deprived individual. Regarding the
third, acts of theft may be motivated either by greed or hatred. While greed
is the most common cause, hatred may also be responsible as when one
person deprives another of his belongings not so much because he wants them
for himself as because he wants to harm the latter. Between the two, acts
motivated by hatred are kammically heavier than acts motivated by sheer
greed.
<!--l. 2998--><p class="indent" >   The positive counterpart to abstaining from stealing is honesty, which implies
respect for the belongings of others and for their right to use their belongings as they
wish. Another related virtue is contentment, being satisfied with what one has
without being inclined to increase one&#8217;s wealth by unscrupulous means. The most
eminent opposite virtue is generosity, giving away one&#8217;s own wealth and possessions
in order to benefit others.
<!--l. 3006--><p class="indent" >   (3) Abstaining from sexual misconduct (kamesu miccha-cara veramani)
<!--l. 3008--><p class="indent" >   He avoids sexual misconduct and abstains from it. He has no intercourse with
such persons as are still under the protection of father, mother, brother, sister or
relatives, nor with married women, nor with female convicts, nor lastly, with
betrothed girls.32
<!--l. 3013--><p class="indent" >   The guiding purposes of this precept, from the ethical standpoint, are to protect
marital relations from outside disruption and to promote trust and fidelity within the
marital union. From the spiritual standpoint it helps curb the expansive tendency of
sexual desire and thus is a step in the direction of renunciation, which reaches its
consummation in the observance of celibacy (brahmacariya) binding on monks and
nuns. But for laypeople the precept enjoins abstaining from sexual relations with an
illicit partner. The primary transgression is entering into full sexual union, but all
other sexual involvements of a less complete kind may be considered secondary
infringements.
<!--l. 3024--><p class="indent" >   The main question raised by the precept concerns who is to count as an
illicit partner. The Buddha&#8217;s statement defines the illicit partner from the
perspective of the man, but later treatises elaborate the matter for both
sexes.33
<!--l. 3029--><p class="indent" >   For a man, three kinds of women are considered illicit partners:
<!--l. 3031--><p class="indent" >   (1) A woman who is married to another man. This includes, besides a woman
already married to a man, a woman who is not his legal wife but is generally
recognized as his consort, who lives with him or is kept by him or is in some way
acknowledged as his partner. All these women are illicit partners for men other than
their own husbands. This class would also include a woman engaged to another man.
But a widow or divorced woman is not out of bounds, provided she is not excluded
for other reasons.
<!--l. 3040--><p class="indent" >   (2) A woman still under protection. This is a girl or woman who is under the
protection of her mother, father, relatives, or others rightfully entitled to be her
guardians. This provision rules out elopements or secret marriages contrary to the
wishes of the protecting party.
<!--l. 3045--><p class="indent" >   (3) A woman prohibited by convention. This includes close female relatives
forbidden as partners by social tradition, nuns and other women under a vow of
celibacy, and those prohibited as partners by the law of the land.

<!--l. 3050--><p class="indent" >   From the standpoint of a woman, two kinds of men are considered illicit
partners:
<!--l. 3053--><p class="indent" >   (1) For a married woman any man other than her husband is out of bounds. Thus
a married woman violates the precept if she breaks her vow of fidelity to her
husband. But a widow or divorcee is free to remarry.
<!--l. 3057--><p class="indent" >   (2) For any woman any man forbidden by convention, such as close relatives and
those under a vow of celibacy, is an illicit partner.
<!--l. 3060--><p class="indent" >   Besides these, any case of forced, violent, or coercive sexual union constitutes a
transgression. But in such a case the violation falls only on the offender, not on the
one compelled to submit.
<!--l. 3064--><p class="indent" >   The positive virtue corresponding to the abstinence is, for laypeople, marital
fidelity. Husband and wife should each be faithful and devoted to the other, content
with the relationship, and should not risk a breakup to the union by seeking outside
partners. The principle does not, however, confine sexual relations to the
marital union. It is flexible enough to allow for variations depending on
social convention. The essential purpose, as was said, is to prevent sexual
relations which are hurtful to others. When mature independent people, though
unmarried, enter into a sexual relationship through free consent, so long as no
other person is intentionally harmed, no breach of the training factor is
involved.
<!--l. 3076--><p class="indent" >   Ordained monks and nuns, including men and women who have undertaken the
eight or ten precepts, are obliged to observe celibacy. They must abstain not only
from sexual misconduct, but from all sexual involvements, at least during the
period of their vows. The holy life at its highest aims at complete purity in
thought, word, and deed, and this requires turning back the tide of sexual
desire.
<!--l. 3083--><p class="indent" >   Right Livelihood (samma ajiva)
<!--l. 3085--><p class="indent" >   Right livelihood is concerned with ensuring that one earns one&#8217;s living in a
righteous way. For a lay disciple the Buddha teaches that wealth should be gained in
accordance with certain standards. One should acquire it only by legal means, not
illegally; one should acquire it peacefully, without coercion or violence; one should
acquire it honestly, not by trickery or deceit; and one should acquire it in ways which
do not entail harm and suffering for others.34 The Buddha mentions five specific
kinds of livelihood which bring harm to others and are therefore to be avoided:
dealing in weapons, in living beings (including raising animals for slaughter as
well as slave trade and prostitution), in meat production and butchery, in
poisons, and in intoxicants (AN 5:177). He further names several dishonest
means of gaining wealth which fall under wrong livelihood: practicing deceit,
treachery, soothsaying, trickery, and usury (MN 117). Obviously any occupation
that requires violation of right speech and right action is a wrong form of
livelihood, but other occupations, such as selling weapons or intoxicants, may not
violate those factors and yet be wrong because of their consequences for
others.
<!--l. 3104--><p class="indent" >   The Thai treatise discusses the positive aspects of right livelihood under the three
convenient headings of rightness regarding actions, rightness regarding persons, and
rightness regarding objects.35 "Rightness regarding actions" means that workers

should fulfill their duties diligently and conscientiously, not idling away time,
claiming to have worked longer hours than they did, or pocketing the company&#8217;s
goods. "Rightness regarding persons" means that due respect and consideration
should be shown to employers, employees, colleagues, and customers. An employer,
for example, should assign his workers chores according to their ability, pay them
adequately, promote them when they deserve a promotion and give them
occasional vacations and bonuses. Colleagues should try to cooperate rather than
compete, while merchants should be equitable in their dealings with customers.
"Rightness regarding objects" means that in business transactions and sales
the articles to be sold should be presented truthfully. There should be no
deceptive advertising, misrepresentations of quality or quantity, or dishonest
manoeuvers.
<!--l. 3122--><p class="indent" >   Chapter V: Right Effort (Samma Vayama)
<!--l. 3124--><p class="indent" >   The purification of conduct established by the prior three factors serves as
the basis for the next division of the path, the division of concentration
(samadhikkhandha). This present phase of practice, which advances from moral
restraint to direct mental training, comprises the three factors of right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration. It gains its name from the goal to which it
aspires, the power of sustained concentration, itself required as the support for
insight-wisdom. Wisdom is the primary tool for deliverance, but the penetrating
vision it yields can only open up when the mind has been composed and collected.
Right concentration brings the requisite stillness to the mind by unifying it with
undistracted focus on a suitable object. To do so, however, the factor of
concentration needs the aid of effort and mindfulness. Right effort provides the
energy demanded by the task, right mindfulness the steadying points for
awareness.
<!--l. 3139--><p class="indent" >   The commentators illustrate the interdependence of the three factors within the
concentration group with a simple simile. Three boys go to a park to play. While
walking along they see a tree with flowering tops and decide they want to gather the
flowers. But the flowers are beyond the reach even of the tallest boy. Then one friend
bends down and offers his back. The tall boy climbs up, but still hesitates to reach
for the flowers from fear of falling. So the third boy comes over and offers his
shoulder for support. The first boy, standing on the back of the second boy,
then leans on the shoulder of the third boy, reaches up, and gathers the
flowers.36
<!--l. 3150--><p class="indent" >   In this simile the tall boy who picks the flowers represents concentration with its
function of unifying the mind. But to unify the mind concentration needs support:
the energy provided by right effort, which is like the boy who offers his back. It
also requires the stabilizing awareness provided by mindfulness, which is
like the boy who offers his shoulder. When right concentration receives this
support, then empowered by right effort and balanced by right mindfulness it
can draw in the scattered strands of thought and fix the mind firmly on its
object.
<!--l. 3159--><p class="indent" >   Energy (viriya), the mental factor behind right effort, can appear in either
wholesome or unwholesome forms. The same factor fuels desire, aggression,
violence, and ambition on the one hand, and generosity, self-discipline, kindness,

concentration, and understanding on the other. The exertion involved in right effort
is a wholesome form of energy, but it is something more specific, namely, the energy
in wholesome states of consciousness directed to liberation from suffering. This last
qualifying phrase is especially important. For wholesome energy to become a
contributor to the path it has to be guided by right view and right intention, and to
work in association with the other path factors. Otherwise, as the energy in ordinary
wholesome states of mind, it merely engenders an accumulation of merit that ripens
within the round of birth and death; it does not issue in liberation from the
round.
<!--l. 3174--><p class="indent" >   Time and again the Buddha has stressed the need for effort, for diligence,
exertion, and unflagging perseverance. The reason why effort is so crucial is that each
person has to work out his or her own deliverance. The Buddha does what he
can by pointing out the path to liberation; the rest involves putting the
path into practice, a task that demands energy. This energy is to be applied
to the cultivation of the mind, which forms the focus of the entire path.
The starting point is the defiled mind, afflicted and deluded; the goal is the
liberated mind, purified and illuminated by wisdom. What comes in between
is the unremitting effort to transform the defiled mind into the liberated
mind. The work of self-cultivation is not easy &#8212; there is no one who can
do it for us but ourselves &#8212; but it is not impossible. The Buddha himself
and his accomplished disciples provide the living proof that the task is not
beyond our reach. They assure us, too, that anyone who follows the path
can accomplish the same goal. But what is needed is effort, the work of
practice taken up with the determination: "I shall not give up my efforts until I
have attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance, energy, and
endeavor."37
<!--l. 3193--><p class="indent" >   The nature of the mental process effects a division of right effort into four "great
endeavors":
<!--l. 3196--><p class="indent" >   to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states;
<!--l. 3198--><p class="indent" >   to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen;
<!--l. 3200--><p class="indent" >   to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen;
<!--l. 3202--><p class="indent" >   to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen.
<!--l. 3204--><p class="indent" >   The unwholesome states (akusala dhamma) are the defilements, and the thoughts,
emotions, and intentions derived from them, whether breaking forth into action or
remaining confined within. The wholesome states (kusala dhamma) are states of
mind untainted by defilements, especially those conducing to deliverance. Each of the
two kinds of mental states imposes a double task. The unwholesome side
requires that the defilements lying dormant be prevented from erupting
and that the active defilements already present be expelled. The wholesome
side requires that the undeveloped liberating factors first be brought into
being, then persistently developed to the point of full maturity. Now we will
examine each of these four divisions of right effort, giving special attention to
their most fertile field of application, the cultivation of the mind through
meditation.
<!--l. 3218--><p class="indent" >   (1) To prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states
<!--l. 3220--><p class="indent" >   Herein the disciple rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil, unwholesome states

that have not yet arisen; and he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and
strives.38
<!--l. 3224--><p class="indent" >   The first side of right effort aims at overcoming unwholesome states, states of
mind tainted by defilements. Insofar as they impede concentration the defilements are
usually presented in a fivefold set called the "five hindrances" (pacanivarana):
sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt.39
They receive the name "hindrances" because they block the path to liberation; they
grow up and over the mind preventing calm and insight, the primary instruments for
progress. The first two hindrances, sensual desire and ill will, are the strongest of the
set, the most formidable barriers to meditative growth, representing, respectively, the
unwholesome roots of greed and aversion. The other three hindrances, less toxic but
still obstructive, are offshoots of delusion, usually in association with other
defilements.
<!--l. 3238--><p class="indent" >   Sensual desire is interpreted in two ways. Sometimes it is understood in a narrow
sense as lust for the "five strands of sense pleasure," i.e., agreeable sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, and touches; sometimes a broader interpretation is given, by which
the term becomes inclusive of craving in all its modes, whether for sense
pleasures, wealth, power, position, fame, or anything else it can settle upon. The
second hindrance, ill will, is a synonym for aversion. It comprises hatred,
anger, resentment, repulsion of every shade, whether directed towards other
people, towards oneself, towards objects, or towards situations. The third
hindrance, dullness and drowsiness, is a compound of two factors linked
together by their common feature of mental unwieldiness. One is dullness
(thina), manifest as mental inertia; the other is drowsiness (middha), seen in
mental sinking, heaviness of mind, or excessive inclination to sleep. At the
opposite extreme is the fourth hindrance, restlessness and worry. This too is a
compound with its two members linked by their common feature of disquietude.
Restlessness (uddhacca) is agitation or excitement, which drives the mind from
thought to thought with speed and frenzy; worry (kukkucca) is remorse
over past mistakes and anxiety about their possible undesired consequences.
The fifth hindrance, doubt, signifies a chronic indecisiveness and lack of
resolution: not the probing of critical intelligence, an attitude encouraged by the
Buddha, but a persistent inability to commit oneself to the course of spiritual
training due to lingering doubts concerning the Buddha, his doctrine, and his
path.
<!--l. 3264--><p class="indent" >   The first effort to be made regarding the hindrances is the effort to prevent the
unarisen hindrances from arising; this is also called the endeavor to restrain
(samvarappadhana). The effort to hold the hindrances in check is imperative
both at the start of meditative training and throughout the course of its
development. For when the hindrances arise, they disperse attention and
darken the quality of awareness, to the detriment of calm and clarity. The
hindrances do not come from outside the mind but from within. They appear
through the activation of certain tendencies constantly lying dormant in
the deep recesses of the mental continuum, awaiting the opportunity to
surface.
<!--l. 3276--><p class="indent" >   Generally what sparks the hindrances into activity is the input afforded by sense

experience. The physical organism is equipped with five sense faculties each receptive
to its own specific kind of data &#8212; the eye to forms, the ear to sounds, the nose to
smells, the tongue to tastes, the body to tangibles. Sense objects continuously
impinge on the senses, which relay the information they receive to the mind, where it
is processed, evaluated, and accorded an appropriate response. But the mind can deal
with the impressions it receives in different ways, governed in the first place by the
manner in which it attends to them. When the mind adverts to the incoming
data carelessly, with unwise consideration (ayoniso manasikara), the sense
objects tend to stir up unwholesome states. They do this either directly,
through their immediate impact, or else indirectly by depositing memory traces
which later may swell up as the objects of defiled thoughts, images, and
fantasies. As a general rule the defilement that is activated corresponds to
the object: attractive objects provoke desire, disagreeable objects provoke
ill will, and indeterminate objects provoke the defilements connected with
delusion.
<!--l. 3295--><p class="indent" >   Since an uncontrolled response to the sensory input stimulates the latent
defilements, what is evidently needed to prevent them from arising is control
over the senses. Thus the Buddha teaches, as the discipline for keeping the
hindrances in check, an exercise called the restraint of the sense faculties
(indriya-samvara):
<!--l. 3301--><p class="indent" >   When he perceives a form with the eye, a sound with the ear, an odor with the
nose, a taste with the tongue, an impression with the body, or an object with the
mind, he apprehends neither the sign nor the particulars. And he strives to ward off
that through which evil and unwholesome states, greed and sorrow, would arise, if he
remained with unguarded senses; and he watches over his senses, restrains his
senses.40
<!--l. 3309--><p class="indent" >   Restraint of the senses does not mean denial of the senses, retreating into a total
withdrawal from the sensory world. This is impossible, and even if it could be
achieved, the real problem would still not be solved; for the defilements lie in the
mind, not in the sense organs or objects. The key to sense control is indicated by the
phrase "not apprehending the sign or the particulars." The "sign" (nimitta) is
the object&#8217;s general appearance insofar as this appearance is grasped as
the basis for defiled thoughts; the "particulars" (anubyanjana) are its less
conspicuous features. If sense control is lacking, the mind roams recklessly
over the sense fields. First it grasps the sign, which sets the defilements into
motion, then it explores the particulars, which permits them to multiply and
thrive.
<!--l. 3322--><p class="indent" >   To restrain the senses requires that mindfulness and clear understanding be
applied to the encounter with the sense fields. Sense consciousness occurs in a series,
as a sequence of momentary cognitive acts each having its own special task. The
initial stages in the series occur as automatic functions: first the mind adverts to
the object, then apprehends it, then admits the percept, examines it, and
identifies it. Immediately following the identification a space opens up in
which there occurs a free evaluation of the object leading to the choice of a
response. When mindfulness is absent the latent defilements, pushing for an
opportunity to emerge, will motivate a wrong consideration. One will grasp

the sign of the object, explore its details, and thereby give the defilements
their opportunity: on account of greed one will become fascinated by an
agreeable object, on account of aversion one will be repelled by a disagreeable
object. But when one applies mindfulness to the sensory encounter, one nips
the cognitive process in the bud before it can evolve into the stages that
stimulate the dormant taints. Mindfulness holds the hindrances in check by
keeping the mind at the level of what is sensed. It rivets awareness on the
given, preventing the mind from embellishing the datum with ideas born of
greed, aversion, and delusion. Then, with this lucent awareness as a guide,
the mind can proceed to comprehend the object as it is, without being led
astray.
<!--l. 3344--><p class="indent" >   (2) To abandon the arisen unwholesome states
<!--l. 3346--><p class="indent" >   Herein the disciple rouses his will to overcome the evil, unwholesome states that
have already arisen and he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and
strives.41
<!--l. 3350--><p class="indent" >   Despite the effort at sense control the defilements may still surface. They
swell up from the depths of the mental continuum, from the buried strata of
past accumulations, to congeal into unwholesome thoughts and emotions.
When this happens a new kind of effort becomes necessary, the effort to
abandon arisen unwholesome states, called for short the endeavor to abandon
(pahanappadhana):
<!--l. 3357--><p class="indent" >   He does not retain any thought of sensual lust, ill will, or harmfulness, or any
other evil and unwholesome states that may have arisen; he abandons them, dispels
them, destroys them, causes them to disappear.42
<!--l. 3361--><p class="indent" >   Just as a skilled physician has different medicines for different ailments, so the
Buddha has different antidotes for the different hindrances, some equally applicable
to all, some geared to a particular hindrance. In an important discourse the Buddha
explains five techniques for expelling distracting thoughts.43 The first is
to expel the defiled thought with a wholesome thought which is its exact
opposite, analogous to the way a carpenter might use a new peg to drive out an
old one. For each of the five hindrances there is a specific remedy, a line
of meditation designed expressly to deflate it and destroy it. This remedy
can be applied intermittently, when a hindrance springs up and disrupts
meditation on the primary subject; or it can be taken as a primary subject itself,
used to counter a defilement repeatedly seen to be a persistent obstacle to
one&#8217;s practice. But for the antidote to become effective in the first role, as a
temporary expedient required by the upsurge of a hindrance, it is best to gain
some familiarity with it by making it a primary object, at least for short
periods.
<!--l. 3378--><p class="indent" >   For desire a remedy of general application is the meditation on impermanence,
which knocks away the underlying prop of clinging, the implicit assumption that the
objects clung to are stable and durable. For desire in the specific form of sensual lust
the most potent antidote is the contemplation of the unattractive nature of the body,
to be dealt with at greater length in the next chapter. Ill will meets its proper
remedy in the meditation on loving-kindness (metta), which banishes all traces of
hatred and anger through the methodical radiation of the altruistic wish that all

beings be well and happy. The dispelling of dullness and drowsiness calls for a special
effort to arouse energy, for which several methods are suggested: the visualization
of a brilliant ball of light, getting up and doing a period of brisk walking
meditation, reflection on death, or simply making a firm determination to continue
striving. Restlessness and worry are most effectively countered by turning the
mind to a simple object that tends to calm it down; the method usually
recommended is mindfulness of breathing, attention to the in-and-out flow of the
breath. In the case of doubt the special remedy is investigation: to make
inquiries, ask questions, and study the teachings until the obscure points become
clear.44
<!--l. 3398--><p class="indent" >   Whereas this first of the five methods for expelling the hindrances involves a
one-to-one alignment between a hindrance and its remedy, the other four utilize
general approaches. The second marshals the forces of shame (hiri) and moral dread
(ottappa) to abandon the unwanted thought: one reflects on the thought as
vile and ignoble or considers its undesirable consequences until an inner
revulsion sets in which drives the thought away. The third method involves
a deliberate diversion of attention. When an unwholesome thought arises
and clamours to be noticed, instead of indulging it one simply shuts it out
by redirecting one&#8217;s attention elsewhere, as if closing one&#8217;s eyes or looking
away to avoid an unpleasant sight. The fourth method uses the opposite
approach. Instead of turning away from the unwanted thought, one confronts it
directly as an object, scrutinizes its features, and investigates its source.
When this is done the thought quiets down and eventually disappears. For an
unwholesome thought is like a thief: it only creates trouble when its operation is
concealed, but put under observation it becomes tame. The fifth method, to
be used only as a last resort, is suppression &#8212; vigorously restraining the
unwholesome thought with the power of the will in the way a strong man
might throw a weaker man to the ground and keep him pinned there with his
weight.
<!--l. 3419--><p class="indent" >   By applying these five methods with skill and discretion, the Buddha says, one
becomes a master of all the pathways of thought. One is no longer the subject of the
mind but its master. Whatever thought one wants to think, that one will think.
Whatever thought one does not want to think, that one will not think. Even if
unwholesome thoughts occasionally arise, one can dispel them immediately,
just as quickly as a red-hot pan will turn to steam a few chance drops of
water.
<!--l. 3427--><p class="indent" >   (3) To arouse unarisen wholesome states
<!--l. 3429--><p class="indent" >   Herein the disciple rouses his will to arouse wholesome states that have not
yet arisen; and he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and
strives.45
<!--l. 3433--><p class="indent" >   Simultaneously with the removal of defilements, right effort also imposes the task
of cultivating wholesome states of mind. This involves two divisions: the arousing of
wholesome states not yet arisen and the maturation of wholesome states already
arisen.
<!--l. 3438--><p class="indent" >   The first of the two divisions is also known as the endeavor to develop
(bhavanappadhana). Though the wholesome states to be developed can be grouped

in various ways &#8212; serenity and insight, the four foundations of mindfulness, the
eight factors of the path, etc. &#8212; the Buddha lays special stress on a set
called the seven factors of enlightenment (satta bojjhanga): mindfulness,
investigation of phenomena, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and
equanimity.
<!--l. 3446--><p class="indent" >   Thus he develops the factors of enlightenment, based on solitude, on detachment,
on cessation, and ending in deliverance, namely: the enlightenment factors of
mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration,
and equanimity.46
<!--l. 3451--><p class="indent" >   The seven states are grouped together as "enlightenment factors" both because
they lead to enlightenment and because they constitute enlightenment. In the
preliminary stages of the path they prepare the way for the great realization; in the
end they remain as its components. The experience of enlightenment, perfect and
complete understanding, is just these seven components working in unison to break
all shackles and bring final release from sorrow.
<!--l. 3459--><p class="indent" >   The way to enlightenment starts with mindfulness. Mindfulness clears the
ground for insight into the nature of things by bringing to light phenomena
in the now, the present moment, stripped of all subjective commentary,
interpretations, and projections. Then, when mindfulness has brought the
bare phenomena into focus, the factor of investigation steps in to search out
their characteristics, conditions, and consequences. Whereas mindfulness
is basically receptive, investigation is an active factor which unflinchingly
probes, analyzes, and dissects phenomena to uncover their fundamental
structures.
<!--l. 3469--><p class="indent" >   The work of investigation requires energy, the third factor of enlightenment,
which mounts in three stages. The first, inceptive energy, shakes off lethargy and
arouses initial enthusiasm. As the work of contemplation advances, energy gathers
momentum and enters the second stage, perseverance, wherein it propels the practice
without slackening. Finally, at the peak, energy reaches the third stage, invincibility,
where it drives contemplation forward leaving the hindrances powerless to stop
it.
<!--l. 3477--><p class="indent" >   As energy increases, the fourth factor of enlightenment is quickened. This is
rapture, a pleasurable interest in the object. Rapture gradually builds up, ascending
to ecstatic heights: waves of bliss run through the body, the mind glows with joy,
fervor and confidence intensify. But these experiences, as encouraging as they are,
still contain a flaw: they create an excitation verging on restlessness. With further
practice, however, rapture subsides and a tone of quietness sets in signalling
the rise of the fifth factor, tranquillity. Rapture remains present, but it is
now subdued, and the work of contemplation proceeds with self-possessed
serenity.
<!--l. 3488--><p class="indent" >   Tranquillity brings to ripeness concentration, the sixth factor, one-pointed
unification of mind. Then, with the deepening of concentration, the last
enlightenment factor comes into dominance. This is equanimity, inward poise and
balance free from the two defects of excitement and inertia. When inertia prevails,
energy must be aroused; when excitement prevails, it is necessary to exercise
restraint. But when both defects have been vanquished the practice can unfold evenly

without need for concern. The mind of equanimity is compared to the driver of a
chariot when the horses are moving at a steady pace: he neither has to urge them
forward nor to hold them back, but can just sit comfortably and watch the
scenery go by. Equanimity has the same "on-looking" quality. When the
other factors are balanced the mind remains poised watching the play of
phenomena.
<!--l. 3502--><p class="indent" >   (4) To maintain arisen wholesome states
<!--l. 3504--><p class="indent" >   Herein the disciple rouses his will to maintain the wholesome things that have
already arisen, and not to allow them to disappear, but to bring them to growth, to
maturity, and to the full perfection of development; and he makes effort, stirs up his
energy, exerts his mind and strives.47
<!--l. 3510--><p class="indent" >   This last of the four right efforts aims at maintaining the arisen wholesome
factors and bringing them to maturity. Called the "endeavor to maintain"
(anurakkhanappadhana), it is explained as the effort to "keep firmly in the mind a
favorable object of concentration that has arisen."48 The work of guarding the object
causes the seven enlightenment factors to gain stability and gradually increase in
strength until they issue in the liberating realization. This marks the culmination of
right effort, the goal in which the countless individual acts of exertion finally reach
fulfillment.
<!--l. 3521--><p class="indent" >   Chapter VI: Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati)
<!--l. 3523--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha says that the Dhamma, the ultimate truth of things, is directly
visible, timeless, calling out to be approached and seen. He says further that it is
always available to us, and that the place where it is to be realized is within
oneself.49 The ultimate truth, the Dhamma, is not something mysterious and remote,
but the truth of our own experience. It can be reached only by understanding our
experience, by penetrating it right through to its foundations. This truth, in order to
become liberating truth, has to be known directly. It is not enough merely to accept
it on faith, to believe it on the authority of books or a teacher, or to think
it out through deductions and inferences. It has to be known by insight,
grasped and absorbed by a kind of knowing which is also an immediate
seeing.
<!--l. 3536--><p class="indent" >   What brings the field of experience into focus and makes it accessible to insight is
a mental faculty called in Pali sati, usually translated as "mindfulness." Mindfulness
is presence of mind, attentiveness or awareness. Yet the kind of awareness involved in
mindfulness differs profoundly from the kind of awareness at work in our usual
mode of consciousness. All consciousness involves awareness in the sense of a
knowing or experiencing of an object. But with the practice of mindfulness
awareness is applied at a special pitch. The mind is deliberately kept at
the level of bare attention, a detached observation of what is happening
within us and around us in the present moment. In the practice of right
mindfulness the mind is trained to remain in the present, open, quiet, and alert,
contemplating the present event. All judgments and interpretations have to
be suspended, or if they occur, just registered and dropped. The task is
simply to note whatever comes up just as it is occurring, riding the changes of
events in the way a surfer rides the waves on the sea. The whole process is
a way of coming back into the present, of standing in the here and now

without slipping away, without getting swept away by the tides of distracting
thoughts.
<!--l. 3556--><p class="indent" >   It might be assumed that we are always aware of the present, but this is a mirage.
Only seldom do we become aware of the present in the precise way required by
the practice of mindfulness. In ordinary consciousness the mind begins a
cognitive process with some impression given in the present, but it does
not stay with it. Instead it uses the immediate impression as a springboard
for building blocks of mental constructs which remove it from the sheer
facticity of the datum. The cognitive process is generally interpretative. The
mind perceives its object free from conceptualization only briefly. Then,
immediately after grasping the initial impression, it launches on a course
of ideation by which it seeks to interpret the object to itself, to make it
intelligible in terms of its own categories and assumptions. To bring this
about the mind posits concepts, joins the concepts into constructs &#8212; sets of
mutually corroborative concepts &#8212; then weaves the constructs together into
complex interpretative schemes. In the end the original direct experience
has been overrun by ideation and the presented object appears only dimly
through dense layers of ideas and views, like the moon through a layer of
clouds.
<!--l. 3575--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha calls this process of mental construction papaca, "elaboration,"
"embellishment," or "conceptual proliferation." The elaborations block out the
presentational immediacy of phenomena; they let us know the object only "at a
distance," not as it really is. But the elaborations do not only screen cognition;
they also serve as a basis for projections. The deluded mind, cloaked in
ignorance, projects its own internal constructs outwardly, ascribing them to the
object as if they really belonged to it. As a result, what we know as the
final object of cognition, what we use as the basis for our values, plans,
and actions, is a patchwork product, not the original article. To be sure,
the product is not wholly illusion, not sheer fantasy. It takes whatis given
in immediate experience as its groundwork and raw material, but along
with this it includes something else: the embellishments fabricated by the
mind.
<!--l. 3591--><p class="indent" >   The springs for this process of fabrication, hidden from view, are the latent
defilements. The defilements create the embellishments, project them outwardly, and
use them as hooks for coming to the surface, where they cause further distortion. To
correct the erroneous notions is the task of wisdom, but for wisdom to discharge its
work effectively, it needs direct access to the object as it is in itself, uncluttered by
the conceptual elaborations. The task of right mindfulness is to clear up the cognitive
field. Mindfulness brings to light experience in its pure immediacy. It reveals
the object as it is before it has been plastered over with conceptual paint,
overlaid with interpretations. To practice mindfulness is thus a matter not so
much of doing but of undoing: not thinking, not judging, not associating, not
planning, not imagining, not wishing. All these "doings" of ours are modes of
interference, ways the mind manipulates experience and tries to establish its
dominance. Mindfulness undoes the knots and tangles of these "doings" by simply
noting. It does nothing but note, watching each occasion of experience as it

arises, stands, and passes away. In the watching there is no room for clinging,
no compulsion to saddle things with our desires. There is only a sustained
contemplation of experience in its bare immediacy, carefully and precisely and
persistently.
<!--l. 3613--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness exercises a powerful grounding function. It anchors the mind securely
in the present, so it does not float away into the past and future with their memories,
regrets, fears, and hopes. The mind without mindfulness is sometimes compared to a
pumpkin, the mind established in mindfulness to a stone.50 A pumpkin placed on the
surface of a pond soon floats away and always remains on the water&#8217;s surface. But a
stone does not float away; it stays where it is put and at once sinks into the water
until it reaches bottom. Similarly, when mindfulness is strong, the mind
stays with its object and penetrates its characteristics deeply. It does not
wander and merely skim the surface as the mind destitute of mindfulness
does.
<!--l. 3625--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness facilitates the achievement of both serenity and insight. It can lead to
either deep concentration or wisdom, depending on the mode in which it is applied.
Merely a slight shift in the mode of application can spell the difference between the
course the contemplative process takes, whether it descends to deeper levels of inner
calm culminating in the stages of absorption, the jhanas, or whether instead it strips
away the veils of delusion to arrive at penetrating insight. To lead to the stages of
serenity the primary chore of mindfulness is to keep the mind on the object, free from
straying. Mindfulness serves as the guard charged with the responsibility of
making sure that the mind does not slip away from the object to lose itself in
random undirected thoughts. It also keeps watch over the factors stirring in
the mind, catching the hindrances beneath their camouflages and expelling
them before they can cause harm. To lead to insight and the realizations
of wisdom, mindfulness is exercised in a more differentiated manner. Its
task, in this phase of practice, is to observe, to note, to discern phenomena
with utmost precision until their fundamental characteristics are brought to
light.
<!--l. 3644--><p class="indent" >   Right mindfulness is cultivated through a practice called "the four foundations of
mindfulness" (cattaro satipatthana), the mindful contemplation of four objective
spheres: the body, feelings, states of mind, and phenomena.51 As the Buddha
explains:
<!--l. 3649--><p class="indent" >   And what, monks, is right mindfulness? Herein, a monk dwells contemplating the
body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief concerning the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in
feelings... states of mind in states of mind... phenomena in phenomena, ardent,
clearly comprehending and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief
concerning the world.52
<!--l. 3656--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha says that the four foundations of mindfulness form "the only way
that leads to the attainment of purity, to the overcoming of sorrow and
lamentation, to the end of pain and grief, to the entering upon the right path and
the realization of Nibbana."53 They are called "the only way" (ekayano
maggo), not for the purpose of setting forth a narrow dogmatism, but to
indicate that the attainment of liberation can only issue from the penetrating

contemplation of the field of experience undertaken in the practice of right
mindfulness.
<!--l. 3666--><p class="indent" >   Of the four applications of mindfulness, the contemplation of the body is
concerned with the material side of existence; the other three are concerned
principally (though not solely) with the mental side. The completion of the
practice requires all four contemplations. Though no fixed order is laid down in
which they are to be taken up, the body is generally taken first as the basic
sphere of contemplation; the others come into view later, when mindfulness
has gained in strength and clarity. Limitations of space do not allow for a
complete explanation of all four foundations. Here we have to settle for a brief
synopsis.
<!--l. 3676--><p class="indent" >   (1) Contemplation of the Body (kayanupassana)
<!--l. 3678--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha begins his exposition of the body with contemplation of the
mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati). Though not required as a starting point for
meditation, in actual practice mindfulness of breathing usually serves as the
"root meditation subject" (mulakammatthana), the foundation for the entire
course of contemplation. It would be a mistake, however, to consider this
subject merely an exercise for neophytes. By itself mindfulness of breathing
can lead to all the stages of the path culminating in full awakening. In fact
it was this meditation subject that the Buddha used on the night of his
own enlightenment. He also reverted to it throughout the years during his
solitary retreats, and constantly recommended it to the monks, praising it as
"peaceful and sublime, an unadulterated blissful abiding, which banishes
at once and stills evil unwholesome thoughts as soon as they arise" (MN
118).
<!--l. 3693--><p class="indent" >   Mindfulness of breathing can function so effectively as a subject of meditation
because it works with a process that is always available to us, the process of
respiration. What it does to turn this process into a basis for meditation is simply to
bring it into the range of awareness by making the breath an object of observation.
The meditation requires no special intellectual sophistication, only awareness of the
breath. One merely breathes naturally through the nostrils keeping the breath in
mind at the contact point around the nostrils or upper lip, where the sensation of
breath can be felt as the air moves in and out. There should be no attempt to
control the breath or to force it into predetermined rhythms, only a mindful
contemplation of the natural process of breathing in and out. The awareness of
breath cuts through the complexities of discursive thinking, rescues us from
pointless wandering in the labyrinth of vain imaginings, and grounds us solidly
in the present. For whenever we become aware of breathing, really aware
of it, we can be aware of it only in the present, never in the past or the
future.
<!--l. 3711--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha&#8217;s exposition of mindfulness of breathing involves four basic steps.
The first two (which are not necessarily sequential) require that a long inhalation or
exhalation be noted as it occurs, and that a short inhalation or exhalation be noted
as it occurs. One simply observes the breath moving in and out, observing it as
closely as possible, noting whether the breath is long or short. As mindfulness grows
sharper, the breath can be followed through the entire course of its movement, from

the beginning of an inhalation through its intermediary stages to its end, then from
the beginning of an exhalation through its intermediary stages to its end.
This third step is called "clearly perceiving the entire (breath) body." The
fourth step, "calming the bodily function," involves a progressive quieting
down of the breath and its associated bodily functions until they become
extremely fine and subtle. Beyond these four basic steps lie more advanced
practices which direct mindfulness of breathing towards deep concentration and
insight.54
<!--l. 3728--><p class="indent" >   Another practice in the contemplation of the body, which extends meditation
outwards from the confines of a single fixed position, is mindfulness of the postures.
The body can assume four basic postures &#8212; walking, standing, sitting, and lying
down &#8212; and a variety of other positions marking the change from one posture to
another. Mindfulness of the postures focuses full attention on the body in whatever
position it assumes: when walking one is aware of walking, when standing one is
aware of standing, when sitting one is aware of sitting, when lying down one is aware
of lying down, when changing postures one is aware of changing postures.
The contemplation of the postures illuminates the impersonal nature of the
body. It reveals that the body is not a self or the belonging of a self, but
merely a configuration of living matter subject to the directing influence of
volition.
<!--l. 3743--><p class="indent" >   The next exercise carries the extension of mindfulness a step further. This
exercise, called "mindfulness and clear comprehension" (satisampajaa), adds to the
bare awareness an element of understanding. When performing any action, one
performs it with full awareness or clear comprehension. Going and coming, looking
ahead and looking aside, bending and stretching, dressing, eating, drinking,
urinating, defecating, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, remaining silent &#8212;
all become occasions for the progress of meditation when done with clear
comprehension. In the commentaries clear comprehension is explained as fourfold: (1)
understanding the purpose of the action, i.e., recognizing its aim and determining
whether that aim accords with the Dhamma; (2) understanding suitability, i.e.,
knowing the most efficient means to achieve one&#8217;s aim; (3) understanding the range
of meditation, i.e., keeping the mind constantly in a meditative frame even when
engaged in action; and (4) understanding without delusion, i.e., seeing the action as
an impersonal process devoid of a controlling ego-entity.55 This last aspect will
be explored more thoroughly in the last chapter, on the development of
wisdom.
<!--l. 3762--><p class="indent" >   The next two sections on mindfulness of the body present analytical
contemplations intended to expose the body&#8217;s real nature. One of these is the
meditation on the body&#8217;s unattractiveness, already touched on in connection with
right effort; the other, the analysis of the body into the four primary elements. The
first, the meditation on unattractiveness,56 is designed to counter infatuation with
the body, especially in its form of sexual desire. The Buddha teaches that the sexual
drive is a manifestation of craving, thus a cause of dukkha that has to be reduced
and extricated as a precondition for bringing dukkha to an end. The meditation aims
at weakening sexual desire by depriving the sexual urge of its cognitive underpinning,
the perception of the body as sensually alluring. Sensual desire rises and

falls together with this perception. It springs up because we view the body
as attractive; it declines when this perception of beauty is removed. The
perception of bodily attractiveness in turn lasts only so long as the body is looked
at superficially, grasped in terms of selected impressions. To counter that
perception we have to refuse to stop with these impressions but proceed to
inspect the body at a deeper level, with a probing scrutiny grounded in
dispassion.
<!--l. 3782--><p class="indent" >   Precisely this is what is undertaken in the meditation on unattractiveness, which
turns back the tide of sensuality by pulling away its perceptual prop. The meditation
takes one&#8217;s own body as object, since for a neophyte to start off with the body of
another, especially a member of the opposite sex, might fail to accomplish the desired
result. Using visualization as an aid, one mentally dissects the body into its
components and investigates them one by one, bringing their repulsive nature to
light. The texts mention thirty-two parts: head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin,
flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large
intestines, small intestines, stomach contents, excrement, brain, bile, phlegm, pus,
blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, snot, spittle, sinovial fluid, and urine. The
repulsiveness of the parts implies the same for the whole: the body seen closeup is
truly unattractive, its beautiful appearance a mirage. But the aim of this
meditation must not be misapprehended. The aim is not to produce aversion
and disgust but detachment, to extinguish the fire of lust by removing its
fuel.57
<!--l. 3800--><p class="indent" >   The other analytical contemplation deals with the body in a different way. This
meditation, called the analysis into elements (dhatuvavatthana), sets out
to counter our innate tendency to identify with the body by exposing the
body&#8217;s essentially impersonal nature. The means it employs, as its name
indicates, is the mental dissection of the body into the four primary elements,
referred to by the archaic names earth, water, fire, and air, but actually
signifying the four principal behavioral modes of matter: solidity, fluidity,
heat, and oscillation. The solid element is seen most clearly in the body&#8217;s
solid parts &#8212; the organs, tissues, and bones; the fluid element, in the bodily
fluids; the heat element, in the body&#8217;s temperature; the oscillation element, in
the respiratory process. The break with the identification of the body as
"I" or "my self" is effected by a widening of perspective after the elements
have come into view. Having analyzed the body into the elements, one then
considers that all four elements, the chief aspects of bodily existence, are
essentially identical with the chief aspects of external matter, with which the
body is in constant interchange. When one vividly realizes this through
prolonged meditation, one ceases to identify with the body, ceases to cling to it.
One sees that the body is nothing more than a particular configuration of
changing material processes which support a stream of changing mental
processes. There is nothing here that can be considered a truly existent
self, nothing that can provide a substantial basis for the sense of personal
identity.58
<!--l. 3825--><p class="indent" >   The last exercise in mindfulness of the body is a series of "cemetery meditations,"
contemplations of the body&#8217;s disintegration after death, which may be performed

either imaginatively, with the aid of pictures, or through direct confrontation
with a corpse. By any of these means one obtains a clear mental image of a
decomposing body, then applies the process to one&#8217;s own body, considering: "This
body, now so full of life, has the same nature and is subject to the same fate.
It cannot escape death, cannot escape disintegration, but must eventually
die and decompose." Again, the purpose of this meditation should not be
misunderstood. The aim is not to indulge in a morbid fascination with death and
corpses, but to sunder our egoistic clinging to existence with a contemplation
sufficiently powerful to break its hold. The clinging to existence subsists
through the implicit assumption of permanence. In the sight of a corpse
we meet the teacher who proclaims unambiguously: "Everything formed is
impermanent."
<!--l. 3842--><p class="indent" >   (2) Contemplation of Feeling (vedananupassana)
<!--l. 3844--><p class="indent" >   The next foundation of mindfulness is feeling (vedana). The word "feeling" is used
here, not in the sense of emotion (a complex phenomenon best subsumed
under the third and fourth foundations of mindfulness), but in the narrower
sense of the affective tone or "hedonic quality" of experience. This may be of
three kinds, yielding three principal types of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful
feeling, and neutral feeling. The Buddha teaches that feeling is an inseparable
concomitant of consciousness, since every act of knowing is colored by some
affective tone. Thus feeling is present at every moment of experience; it may be
strong or weak, clear or indistinct, but some feeling must accompany the
cognition.
<!--l. 3856--><p class="indent" >   Feeling arises in dependence on a mental event called "contact" (phassa).
Contact marks the "coming together" of consciousness with the object via a
sense faculty; it is the factor by virtue of which consciousness "touches" the
object presenting itself to the mind through the sense organ. Thus there are
six kinds of contact distinguished by the six sense faculties &#8212; eye-contact,
ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact
&#8212; and six kinds of feeling distinguished by the contact from which they
spring.
<!--l. 3866--><p class="indent" >   Feeling acquires special importance as an object of contemplation because it is
feeling that usually triggers the latent defilements into activity. The feelings may not
be clearly registered, but in subtle ways they nourish and sustain the dispositions to
unwholesome states. Thus when a pleasant feeling arises, we fall under the influence
of the defilement greed and cling to it. When a painful feeling occurs, we respond
with displeasure, hate, and fear, which are aspects of aversion. And when a neutral
feeling occurs, we generally do not notice it, or let it lull us into a false sense of
security &#8212; states of mind governed by delusion. From this it can be seen that
each of the root defilements is conditioned by a particular kind of feeling:
greed by pleasant feeling, aversion by painful feeling, delusion by neutral
feeling.
<!--l. 3880--><p class="indent" >   But the link between feelings and the defilements is not a necessary one. Pleasure
does not always have to lead to greed, pain to aversion, neutral feeling to
delusion. The tie between them can be snapped, and one essential means for
snapping it is mindfulness. Feeling will stir up a defilement only when it is

not noticed, when it is indulged rather than observed. By turning it into
an object of observation, mindfulness defuses the feeling so that it cannot
provoke an unwholesome response. Then, instead of relating to the feeling by
way of habit through attachment, repulsion, or apathy, we relate by way of
contemplation, using the feeling as a springboard for understanding the nature of
experience.
<!--l. 3892--><p class="indent" >   In the early stages the contemplation of feeling involves attending to the arisen
feelings, noting their distinctive qualities: pleasant, painful, neutral. The feeling is
noted without identifying with it, without taking it to be "I" or "mine" or
something happening "to me." Awareness is kept at the level of bare attention:
one watches each feeling that arises, seeing it as merely a feeling, a bare
mental event shorn of all subjective references, all pointers to an ego. The
task is simply to note the feeling&#8217;s quality, its tone of pleasure, pain, or
neutrality.
<!--l. 3902--><p class="indent" >   But as practice advances, as one goes on noting each feeling, letting it go and
noting the next, the focus of attention shifts from the qualities of feelings to the
process of feeling itself. The process reveals a ceaseless flux of feelings arising and
dissolving, succeeding one another without a halt. Within the process there is
nothing lasting. Feeling itself is only a stream of events, occasions of feeling flashing
into being moment by moment, dissolving as soon as they arise. Thus begins
the insight into impermanence, which, as it evolves, overturns the three
unwholesome roots. There is no greed for pleasant feelings, no aversion for
painful feelings, no delusion over neutral feelings. All are seen as merely
fleeting and substanceless events devoid of any true enjoyment or basis for
involvement.
<!--l. 3915--><p class="indent" >   (3) Contemplation of the State of Mind (cittanupassana)
<!--l. 3917--><p class="indent" >   With this foundation of mindfulness we turn from a particular mental factor,
feeling, to the general state of mind to which that factor belongs. To understand
what is entailed by this contemplation it is helpful to look at the Buddhist
conception of the mind. Usually we think of the mind as an enduring faculty
remaining identical with itself through the succession of experiences. Though
experience changes, the mind which undergoes the changing experience seems to
remain the same, perhaps modified in certain ways but still retaining its
identity. However, in the Buddha&#8217;s teaching the notion of a permanent mental
organ is rejected. The mind is regarded, not as a lasting subject of thought,
feeling, and volition, but as a sequence of momentary mental acts, each
distinct and discrete, their connections with one another causal rather than
substantial.
<!--l. 3931--><p class="indent" >   A single act of consciousness is called a citta, which we shall render "a state of
mind." Each citta consists of many components, the chief of which is consciousness
itself, the basic experiencing of the object; consciousness is also called citta, the name
for the whole being given to its principal part. Along with consciousness
every citta contains a set of concomitants called cetasikas, mental factors.
These include feeling, perception, volition, the emotions, etc.; in short, all the
mental functions except the primary knowing of the object, which is citta or
consciousness.

<!--l. 3941--><p class="indent" >   Since consciousness in itself is just a bare experiencing of an object, it cannot be
differentiated through its own nature but only by way of its associated factors, the
cetasikas. The cetasikas color the citta and give it its distinctive character; thus when
we want to pinpoint the citta as an object of contemplation, we have to do so by
using the cetasikas as indicators. In his exposition of the contemplation of the state of
mind, the Buddha mentions, by reference to cetasikas, sixteen kinds of citta to be
noted: the mind with lust, the mind without lust, the mind with aversion, the mind
without aversion, the mind with delusion, the mind without delusion, the
cramped mind, the scattered mind, the developed mind, the undeveloped mind,
the surpassable mind, the unsurpassable mind, the concentrated mind, the
unconcentrated mind, the freed mind, the unfreed mind. For practical purposes it is
sufficient at the start to focus solely on the first six states, noting whether the
mind is associated with any of the unwholesome roots or free from them.
When a particular citta is present, it is contemplated merely as a citta,
a state of mind. It is not identified with as "I" or "mine," not taken as a
self or as something belonging to a self. Whether it is a pure state of mind
or a defiled state, a lofty state or a low one, there should be no elation or
dejection, only a clear recognition of the state. The state is simply noted, then
allowed to pass without clinging to the desired ones or resenting the undesired
ones.
<!--l. 3965--><p class="indent" >   As contemplation deepens, the contents of the mind become increasingly
rarefied. Irrelevant flights of thought, imagination, and emotion subside,
mindfulness becomes clearer, the mind remains intently aware, watching its own
process of becoming. At times there might appear to be a persisting observer
behind the process, but with continued practice even this apparent observer
disappears. The mind itself &#8212; the seemingly solid, stable mind &#8212; dissolves
into a stream of cittas flashing in and out of being moment by moment,
coming from nowhere and going nowhere, yet continuing in sequence without
pause.
<!--l. 3975--><p class="indent" >   (4) Contemplation of Phenomena (dhammanupassana)
<!--l. 3977--><p class="indent" >   In the context of the fourth foundation of mindfulness, the multivalent word
dhamma (here intended in the plural) has two interconnected meanings, as the
account in the sutta shows. One meaning is cetasikas, the mental factors, which are
now attended to in their own right apart from their role as coloring the state of mind,
as was done in the previous contemplation. The other meaning is the elements of
actuality, the ultimate constituents of experience as structured in the Buddha&#8217;s
teaching.To convey both senses we render dhamma as "phenomena," for lack of a
better alternative. But when we do so this should not be taken to imply the existence
of some noumenon or substance behind the phenomena.The point of the Buddha&#8217;s
teaching of anatta, egolessness, is that the basic constituents of actuality
are bare phenomena (suddha-dhamma) occurring without any noumenal
support.
<!--l. 3991--><p class="indent" >   The sutta section on the contemplation of phenomena is divided into five
sub-sections, each devoted to a different set of phenomena: the five hindrances, the
five aggregates, the six inner and outer sense bases, the seven factors of
enlightenment, and the Four Noble Truths. Among these, the five hindrances and the

seven enlightenment factors are dhamma in the narrower sense of mental factors, the
others are dhamma in the broader sense of constituents of actuality. (In
the third section, however, on the sense bases, there is a reference to the
fetters that arise through the senses; these can also be included among the
mental factors.) In the present chapter we shall deal briefly only with the two
groups that may be regarded as dhamma in the sense of mental factors. We
already touched on both of these in relation to right effort (Chapter V);
now we shall consider them in specific connection with the practice of right
mindfulness. We shall discuss the other types of dhamma &#8212; the five aggregates
and the six senses &#8212; in the final chapter, in relation to the development of
wisdom.
<!--l. 4009--><p class="indent" >   The five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment require special attention
because they are the principal impediments and aids to liberation. The hindrances &#8212;
sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt &#8212;
generally become manifest in an early stage of practice, soon after the initial
expectations and gross disturbances subside and the subtle tendencies find the
opportunity to surface. Whenever one of the hindrances crops up, its presence
should be noted; then, when it fades away, a note should be made of its
disappearance. To ensure that the hindrances are kept under control an element of
comprehension is needed: we have to understand how the hindrances arise, how
they can be removed, and how they can be prevented from arising in the
future.59
<!--l. 4022--><p class="indent" >   A similar mode of contemplation is to be applied to the seven factors of
enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration,
and equanimity. When any one of these factors arises, its presence should be noted.
Then, after noting its presence, one has to investigate to discover how it arises and
how it can be matured.60 When they first spring up, the enlightenment factors are
weak, but with consistent cultivation they accumulate strength. Mindfulness initiates
the contemplative process. When it becomes well-established, it arouses investigation,
the probing quality of intelligence. Investigation in turn calls forth energy, energy
gives rise to rapture, rapture leads to tranquillity, tranquillity to one-pointed
concentration, and concentration to equanimity. Thus the whole evolving course of
practice leading to enlightenment begins with mindfulness, which remains
throughout as the regulating power ensuring that the mind is clear, cognizant, and
balanced.
<!--l. 4038--><p class="indent" >   Chapter VII: Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi)
<!--l. 4040--><p class="indent" >   The eighth factor of the path is right concentration, in Pali samma samadhi.
Concentration represents an intensification of a mental factor present in every state
of consciousness. This factor, one-pointedness of mind (citt&#8217;ekaggata), has the
function of unifying the other mental factors in the task of cognition. It is the factor
responsible for the individuating aspect of consciousness, ensuring that every
citta or act of mind remains centered on its object. At any given moment
the mind must be cognizant of something &#8212; a sight, a sound, a smell, a
taste, a touch, or a mental object. The factor of one-pointedness unifies the
mind and its other concomitants in the task of cognizing the object, while it
simultaneously exercises the function of centering all the constituents of the

cognitive act on the object. One-pointedness of mind explains the fact that in
any act of consciousness there is a central point of focus, towards which
the entire objective datum points from its outer peripheries to its inner
nucleus.
<!--l. 4056--><p class="indent" >   However, samadhi is only a particular kind of one-pointedness; it is not equivalent
to one-pointedness in its entirety. A gourmet sitting down to a meal, an assassin
about to slay his victim, a soldier on the battlefield &#8212; these all act with
a concentrated mind, but their concentration cannot be characterized as
samadhi.Samadhi is exclusively wholesome one-pointedness, the concentration in a
wholesome state of mind. Even then its range is still narrower: it does not signify
every form of wholesome concentration, but only the intensified concentration that
results from a deliberate attempt to raise the mind to a higher, more purified level of
awareness.
<!--l. 4067--><p class="indent" >   The commentaries define samadhi as the centering of the mind and mental factors
rightly and evenly on an object. Samadhi, as wholesome concentration, collects
together the ordinarily dispersed and dissipated stream of mental states to induce an
inner unification. The two salient features of a concentrated mind are unbroken
attentiveness to an object and the consequent tranquillity of the mental functions,
qualities which distinguish it from the unconcentrated mind. The mind untrained in
concentration moves in a scattered manner which the Buddha compares to the
flapping about of a fish taken from the water and thrown onto dry land. It cannot
stay fixed but rushes from idea to idea, from thought to thought, without inner
control. Such a distracted mind is also a deluded mind. Overwhelmed by
worries and concerns, a constant prey to the defilements, it sees things only in
fragments, distorted by the ripples of random thoughts. But the mind that
has been trained in concentration, in contrast, can remain focused on its
object without distraction. This freedom from distraction further induces
a softness and serenity which make the mind an effective instrument for
penetration. Like a lake unruffled by any breeze, the concentrated mind is
a faithful reflector that mirrors whatever is placed before it exactly as it
is.
<!--l. 4088--><p class="indent" >   The Development of Concentration
<!--l. 4090--><p class="indent" >   Concentration can be developed through either of two methods &#8212; either as the
goal of a system of practice directed expressly towards the attainment of deep
concentration at the level of absorption or as the incidental accompaniment
of the path intended to generate insight. The former method is called the
development of serenity (samatha-bhavana), the second the development of insight
(vipassana-bhavana). Both paths share certain preliminary requirements. For both,
moral discipline must be purified, the various impediments must be severed, the
meditator must seek out suitable instruction (preferrably from a personal teacher),
and must resort to a dwelling conducive to practice. Once these preliminaries have
been dispensed with, the meditator on the path of serenity has to obtain an
object of meditation, something to be used as a focal point for developing
concentration.61
<!--l. 4104--><p class="indent" >   If the meditator has a qualified teacher, the teacher will probably assign him an
object judged to be appropriate for his temperament. If he doesn&#8217;t have a teacher, he

will have to select an object himself, perhaps after some experimentation. The
meditation manuals collect the subjects of serenity meditation into a set
of forty, called "places of work" (kammatthana) since they are the places
where the meditator does the work of practice. The forty may be listed as
follows:
<!--l. 4113--><p class="indent" >   ten kasinas ten unattractive objects (dasa asubha) ten recollections (dasa
anussatiyo) four sublime states (cattaro brahmavihara) four immaterial states
(cattaro aruppa) one perception (eka saa) one analysis (eka vavatthana).
<!--l. 4118--><p class="indent" >   The kasinas are devices representing certain primordial qualities. Four represent
the primary elements &#8212; the earth, water, fire, and air kasinas; four represent colors
&#8212; the blue, yellow, red, and white kasinas; the other two are the light and the space
kasinas. Each kasina is a concrete object representative of the universal quality it
signifies. Thus an earth kasina would be a circular disk filled with clay. To
develop concentration on the earth kasina the meditator sets the disk in
front of him, fixes his gaze on it, and contemplates "earth, earth." A similar
method is used for the other kasinas, with appropriate changes to fit the
case.
<!--l. 4130--><p class="indent" >   The ten "unattractive objects" are corpses in different stages of decomposition.
This subject appears similar to the contemplation of bodily decay in the mindfulness
of the body, and in fact in olden times the cremation ground was recommended as
the most appropriate place for both. But the two meditations differ in emphasis. In
the mindfulness exercise stress falls on the application of reflective thought, the sight
of the decaying corpse serving as a stimulus for consideration of one&#8217;s own eventual
death and disintegration. In this exercise the use of reflective thought is discouraged.
The stress instead falls on one-pointed mental fixation on the object, the less thought
the better.
<!--l. 4142--><p class="indent" >   The ten recollections form a miscellaneous collection. The first three are
devotional meditations on the qualities of the Triple Gem &#8212; the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha; they use as their basis standard formulas that have come
down in the Suttas. The next three recollections also rely on ancient formulas: the
meditations on morality, generosity, and the potential for divine-like qualities in
oneself. Then come mindfulness of death, the contemplation of the unattractive
nature of the body, mindfulness of breathing, and lastly, the recollection of peace, a
discursive meditation on Nibbana.
<!--l. 4152--><p class="indent" >   The four sublime states or "divine abodes" are the outwardly directed social
attitudes &#8212; loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity &#8212;
developed into universal radiations which are gradually extended in range
until they encompass all living beings. The four immaterial states are the
objective bases for certain deep levels of absorption: the base of infinite space,
the base of infinite consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. These become accessible as objects only to
those who are already adept in concentration. The "one perception" is the perception
of the repulsiveness of food, a discursive topic intended to reduce attachment to the
pleasures of the palate. The "one analysis" is the contemplation of the body in
terms of the four primary elements, already discussed in the chapter on right
mindfulness.

<!--l. 4168--><p class="indent" >   When such a variety of meditation subjects is presented, the aspiring meditator
without a teacher might be perplexed as to which to choose. The manuals divide the
forty subjects according to their suitability for different personality types. Thus the
unattractive objects and the contemplation of the parts of the body are judged to be
most suitable for a lustful type, the meditation on loving-kindness to be
best for a hating type, the meditation on the qualities of the Triple Gem
to be most effective for a devotional type, etc. But for practical purposes
the beginner in meditation can generally be advised to start with a simple
subject that helps reduce discursive thinking. Mental distraction caused by
restlessness and scattered thoughts is a common problem faced by persons of all
different character types; thus a meditator of any temperament can benefit
from a subject which promotes a slowing down and stilling of the thought
process. The subject generally recommended for its effectiveness in clearing the
mind of stray thoughts is mindfulness of breathing, which can therefore be
suggested as the subject most suitable for beginners as well as veterans seeking a
direct approach to deep concentration. Once the mind settles down and
one&#8217;s thought patterns become easier to notice, one might then make use of
other subjects to deal with special problems that arise: the meditation on
loving-kindness may be used to counteract anger and ill will, mindfulness of the
bodily parts to weaken sensual lust, the recollection of the Buddha to inspire
faith and devotion, the meditation on death to arouse a sense of urgency.
The ability to select the subject appropriate to the situation requires skill,
but this skill evolves through practice, often through simple trial-and-error
experimentation.
<!--l. 4195--><p class="indent" >   The Stages of Concentration
<!--l. 4197--><p class="indent" >   Concentration is not attained all at once but develops in stages. To enable our
exposition to cover all the stages of concentration, we will consider the case of a
meditator who follows the entire path of serenity meditation from start to finish, and
who will make much faster progress than the typical meditator is likely to
make.
<!--l. 4203--><p class="indent" >   After receiving his meditation subject from a teacher, or selecting it
on his own, the meditator retires to a quiet place. There he assumes the
correct meditation posture &#8212; the legs crossed comfortably, the upper part
of the body held straight and erect, hands placed one above the other on
the lap, the head kept steady, the mouth and eyes closed (unless a kasina
or other visual object is used), the breath flowing naturally and regularly
through the nostrils. He then focuses his mind on the object and tries to
keep it there, fixed and alert. If the mind strays, he notices this quickly,
catches it, and brings it back gently but firmly to the object, doing this over
and over as often as is necessary. This initial stage is called preliminary
concentration (parikkamma-samadhi) and the object the preliminary sign
(parikkamma-nimitta).
<!--l. 4217--><p class="indent" >   Once the initial excitement subsides and the mind begins to settle into the
practice, the five hindrances are likely to arise, bubbling up from the depths.
Sometimes they appear as thoughts, sometimes as images, sometimes as obsessive
emotions: surges of desire, anger and resentment, heaviness of mind, agitation,

doubts. The hindrances pose a formidable barrier, but with patience and sustained
effort they can be overcome. To conquer them the meditator will have to be adroit.
At times, when a particular hindrance becomes strong, he may have to lay aside his
primary subject of meditation and take up another subject expressly opposed to the
hindrance. At other times he will have to persist with his primary subject
despite the bumps along the road, bringing his mind back to it again and
again.
<!--l. 4230--><p class="indent" >   As he goes on striving along the path of concentration, his exertion activates
five mental factors which come to his aid. These factors are intermittently
present in ordinary undirected consciousness, but there they lack a unifying
bond and thus do not play any special role. However, when activated by
the work of meditation, these five factors pick up power, link up with one
another, and steer the mind towards samadhi, which they will govern as the
"jhana factors," the factors of absorption (jhananga). Stated in their usual
order the five are: initial application of mind (vitakka), sustained application
of mind (vicara), rapture (piti), happiness (sukha), and one-pointedness
(ekaggata).
<!--l. 4242--><p class="indent" >   Initial application of mind does the work of directing the mind to the
object. It takes the mind, lifts it up, and drives it into the object the way one
drives a nail through a block of wood. This done, sustained application of
mind anchors the mind on the object, keeping it there through its function
of examination. To clarify the difference between these two factors, initial
application is compared to the striking of a bell, sustained application to the
bell&#8217;s reverberations. Rapture, the third factor, is the delight and joy that
accompany a favorable interest in the object, while happiness, the fourth
factor, is the pleasant feeling that accompanies successful concentration. Since
rapture and happiness share similar qualities they tend to be confused with
each other, but the two are not identical. The difference between them is
illustrated by comparing rapture to the joy of a weary desert-farer who sees
an oasis in the distance, happiness to his pleasure when drinking from the
pond and resting in the shade. The fifth and final factor of absorption is
one-pointedness, which has the pivotal function of unifying the mind on the
object.62
<!--l. 4260--><p class="indent" >   When concentration is developed, these five factors spring up and counteract the
five hindrances. Each absorption factor opposes a particular hindrance. Initial
application of mind, through its work of lifting the mind up to the object, counters
dullness and drowsiness. Sustained application, by anchoring the mind on the object,
drives away doubt. Rapture shuts out ill will, happiness excludes restlessness and
worry, and one-pointedness counters sensual desire, the most alluring inducement to
distraction. Thus, with the strengthening of the absorption factors, the hindrances
fade out and subside. They are not yet eradicated &#8212; eradication can only be effected
by wisdom, the third division of the path &#8212; but they have been reduced to a
state of quiescence where they cannot disrupt the forward movement of
concentration.
<!--l. 4273--><p class="indent" >   At the same time that the hindrances are being overpowered by the jhana factors
inwardly, on the side of the object too certain changes are taking place. The original

object of concentration, the preliminary sign, is a gross physical object; in
the case of a kasina, it is a disk representing the chosen element or color,
in the case of mindfulness of breathing the touch sensation of the breath,
etc. But with the strengthening of concentration the original object gives
rise to another object called the "learning sign" (uggaha-nimitta). For a
kasina this will be a mental image of the disk seen as clearly in the mind
as the original object was with the eyes; for the breath it will be a reflex
image arisen from the touch sensation of the air currents moving around the
nostrils.
<!--l. 4286--><p class="indent" >   When the learning sign appears, the meditator leaves off the preliminary sign
and fixes his attention on the new object. In due time still another object
will emerge out of the learning sign. This object, called the "counterpart
sign" (patibhaga-nimitta), is a purified mental image many times brighter
and clearer than the learning sign. The learning sign is compared to the
moon seen behind a cloud, the counterpart sign to the moon freed from the
cloud. Simultaneously with the appearance of the counterpart sign, the five
absorption factors suppress the five hindrances, and the mind enters the stage of
concentration called upacara-samadhi, "access concentration." Here, in access
concentration, the mind is drawing close to absorption. It has entered the
"neighbourhood" (a possible meaning of upacara) of absorption, but more work is
still needed for it to become fully immersed in the object, the defining mark of
absorption.
<!--l. 4302--><p class="indent" >   With further practice the factors of concentration gain in strength and bring the
mind to absorption (appana-samadhi). Like access concentration, absorption takes
the counterpart sign as object. The two stages of concentration are differentiated
neither by the absence of the hindrances nor by the counterpart sign as object;
these are common to both. What differentiates them is the strength of the
jhana factors. In access concentration the jhana factors are present, but they
lack strength and steadiness. Thus the mind in this stage is compared to a
child who has just learned to walk: he takes a few steps, falls down, gets up,
walks some more, and again falls down. But the mind in absorption is like a
man who wants to walk: he just gets up and walks straight ahead without
hesitation.
<!--l. 4315--><p class="indent" >   Concentration in the stage of absorption is divided into eight levels, each
marked by greater depth, purity, and subtlety than its predecessor. The
first four form a set called the four jhanas, a word best left untranslated for
lack of a suitable equivalent, though it can be loosely rendered "meditative
absorption."63 The second four also form a set, the four immaterial states (aruppa).
The eight have to be attained in progressive order, the achievement of any
later level being dependent on the mastery of the immediately preceding
level.
<!--l. 4325--><p class="indent" >   The four jhanas make up the usual textual definition of right concentration. Thus
the Buddha says:
<!--l. 4328--><p class="indent" >   And what, monks, is right concentration? Herein, secluded from sense pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, a monk enters and dwells in the first jhana, which
is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind and filled with rapture

and happiness born of seclusion.
<!--l. 4334--><p class="indent" >   Then, with the subsiding of initial and sustained application of mind, by gaining
inner confidence and mental unification, he enters and dwells in the second jhana,
which is free from initial and sustained application but is filled with rapture and
happiness born of concentration.
<!--l. 4339--><p class="indent" >   With the fading out of rapture, he dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly
comprehending; and he experiences in his own person that bliss of which the noble
ones say: "Happily lives he who is equanimous and mindful" &#8212; thus he enters and
dwells in the third jhana.
<!--l. 4345--><p class="indent" >   With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance
of joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pleasure-nor-pain and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.
<!--l. 4349--><p class="indent" >   This, monks, is right concentration.64
<!--l. 4351--><p class="indent" >   The jhanas are distinguished by way of their component factors. The first jhana is
constituted by the original set of five absorption factors: initial application, sustained
application, rapture, happiness, and one-pointedness. After attaining the first jhana
the meditator is advised to master it. On the one hand he should not fall into
complacency over his achievement and neglect sustained practice; on the other, he
should not become over-confident and rush ahead to attain the next jhana. To master
the jhana he should enter it repeatedly and perfect his skill in it, until he can
attain it, remain in it, emerge from it, and review it without any trouble or
difficulty.
<!--l. 4362--><p class="indent" >   After mastering the first jhana, the meditator then considers that his attainment
has certain defects. Though the jhana is certainly far superior to ordinary sense
consciousness, more peaceful and blissful, it still stands close to sense consciousness
and is not far removed from the hindrances. Moreover, two of its factors, initial
application and sustained application, appear in time to be rather coarse, not as
refined as the other factors. Then the meditator renews his practice of concentration
intent on overcoming initial and sustained application. When his faculties mature,
these two factors subside and he enters the second jhana. This jhana contains only
three component factors: rapture, happiness, and one-pointedness. It also contains a
multiplicity of other constituents, the most prominent of which is confidence of
mind.
<!--l. 4376--><p class="indent" >   In the second jhana the mind becomes more tranquil and more thoroughly
unified, but when mastered even this state seems gross, as it includes rapture, an
exhilarating factor that inclines to excitation. So the meditator sets out again on his
course of training, this time resolved on overcoming rapture. When rapture
fades out, he enters the third jhana. Here there are only two absorption
factors, happiness and one-pointedness, while some other auxiliary states
come into ascendency, most notably mindfulness, clear comprehension, and
equanimity. But still, the meditator sees, this attainment is defective in that it
contains the feeling of happiness, which is gross compared to neutral feeling,
feeling that is neither pleasant not painful. Thus he strives to get beyond even
the sublime happiness of the third jhana. When he succeeds, he enters the
fourth jhana, which is defined by two factors &#8212; one-pointedness and neutral
feeling &#8212; and has a special purity of mindfulness due to the high level of

equanimity.
<!--l. 4392--><p class="indent" >   Beyond the four jhanas lie the four immaterial states, levels of absorption
in which the mind transcends even the subtlest perception of visualized
images still sometimes persisting in the jhanas. The immaterial states are
attained, not by refining mental factors as are the jhanas, but by refining
objects, by replacing a relatively gross object with a subtler one. The four
attainments are named after their respective objects: the base of infinite space,
the base of infinite consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.65 These states represent levels of
concentration so subtle and remote as to elude clear verbal explanation. The last
of the four stands at the apex of mental concentration; it is the absolute,
maximum degree of unification possible for consciousness. But even so, these
absorptions reached by the path of serenity meditation, as exalted as they are,
still lack the wisdom of insight, and so are not yet sufficient for gaining
deliverance.
<!--l. 4408--><p class="indent" >   The kinds of concentration discussed so far arise by fixing the mind upon a single
object to the exclusion of other objects. But apart from these there is another kind of
concentration which does not depend upon restricting the range of awareness.
This is called "momentary concentration" (khanika-samadhi). To develop
momentary concentration the meditator does not deliberately attempt to
exclude the multiplicity of phenomena from his field of attention. Instead, he
simply directs mindfulness to the changing states of mind and body, noting
any phenomenon that presents itself; the task is to maintain a continuous
awareness of whatever enters the range of perception, clinging to nothing.
As he goes on with his noting, concentration becomes stronger moment
after moment until it becomes established one-pointedly on the constantly
changing stream of events. Despite the change in the object, the mental
unification remains steady, and in time acquires a force capable of suppressing the
hindrances to a degree equal to that of access concentration. This fluid,
mobile concentration is developed by the practice of the four foundations of
mindfulness, taken up along the path of insight; when sufficiently strong
it issues in the breakthrough to the last stage of the path, the arising of
wisdom.
<!--l. 4429--><p class="indent" >   Chapter VIII: The Development of Wisdom
<!--l. 4431--><p class="indent" >   Though right concentration claims the last place among the factors of the Noble
Eightfold Path, concentration itself does not mark the path&#8217;s culmination.
The attainment of concentration makes the mind still and steady, unifies its
concomitants, opens vast vistas of bliss, serenity, and power. But by itself it does
not suffice to reach the highest accomplishment, release from the bonds of
suffering. To reach the end of suffering demands that the Eightfold Path
be turned into an instrument of discovery, that it be used to generate the
insights unveiling the ultimate truth of things. This requires the combined
contributions of all eight factors, and thus a new mobilization of right view and
right intention. Up to the present point these first two path factors have
performed only a preliminary function. Now they have to be taken up again
and raised to a higher level. Right view is to become a direct seeing into

the real nature of phenomena, previously grasped only conceptually; right
intention, to become a true renunciation of defilements born out of deep
understanding.
<!--l. 4448--><p class="indent" >   Before we turn to the development of wisdom, it will be helpful to inquire why
concentration is not adequate to the attainment of liberation. Concentration does not
suffice to bring liberation because it fails to touch the defilements at their
fundamental level. The Buddha teaches that the defilements are stratified into three
layers: the stage of latent tendency, the stage of manifestation, and the stage of
transgression. The most deeply grounded is the level of latent tendency (anusaya),
where a defilement merely lies dormant without displaying any activity. The
second level is the stage of manifestation (pariyutthana), where a defilement,
through the impact of some stimulus, surges up in the form of unwholesome
thoughts, emotions, and volitions. Then, at the third level, the defilement
passes beyond a purely mental manifestation to motivate some unwholesome
action of body or speech. Hence this level is called the stage of transgression
(vitikkama).
<!--l. 4463--><p class="indent" >   The three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path provide the check against this
threefold layering of the defilements. The first, the training in moral discipline,
restrains unwholesome bodily and verbal activity and thus prevents defilements from
reaching the stage of transgression. The training in concentration provides the
safeguard against the stage of manifestation. It removes already manifest defilements
and protects the mind from their continued influx. But even though concentration
may be pursued to the depths of full absorption, it cannot touch the basic source of
affliction &#8212; the latent tendencies lying dormant in the mental continuum. Against
these concentration is powerless, since to root them out calls for more than mental
calm. What it calls for, beyond the composure and serenity of the unified mind, is
wisdom (paa), a penetrating vision of phenomena in their fundamental mode of
being.
<!--l. 4478--><p class="indent" >   Wisdom alone can cut off the latent tendencies at their root because the most
fundamental member of the set, the one which nurtures the others and holds them in
place, is ignorance (avijja), and wisdom is the remedy for ignorance. Though verbally
a negative, "unknowing," ignorance is not a factual negative, a mere privation of
right knowledge. It is, rather, an insidious and volatile mental factor incessantly at
work inserting itself into every compartment of our inner life. It distorts cognition,
dominates volition, and determines the entire tone of our existence. As the
Buddha says: "The element of ignorance is indeed a powerful element" (SN
14:13).
<!--l. 4489--><p class="indent" >   At the cognitive level, which is its most basic sphere of operation, ignorance
infiltrates our perceptions, thoughts, and views, so that we come to misconstrue our
experience, overlaying it with multiple strata of delusions. The most important of
these delusions are three: the delusions of seeing permanence in the impermanent, of
seing satisfaction in the unsatisfactory, and of seeing a self in the selfless.66
Thus we take ourselves and our world to be solid, stable, enduring entities,
despite the ubiquitous reminders that everything is subject to change and
destruction. We assume we have an innate right to pleasure, and direct our
efforts to increasing and intensifying our enjoyment with an anticipatory

fervor undaunted by repeated encounters with pain, disappointment, and
frustration. And we perceive ourselves as self-contained egos, clinging to the
various ideas and images we form of ourselves as the irrefragable truth of our
identity.
<!--l. 4504--><p class="indent" >   Whereas ignorance obscures the true nature of things, wisdom removes the veils
of distortion, enabling us to see phenomena in their fundamental mode of being with
the vivacity of direct perception. The training in wisdom centers on the development
of insight (vipassana-bhavana), a deep and comprehensive seeing into the nature of
existence which fathoms the truth of our being in the only sphere where it
is directly accessible to us, namely, in our own experience. Normally we
are immersed in our experience, identified with it so completely that we
do not comprehend it. We live it but fail to understand its nature. Due to
this blindness experience comes to be misconstrued, worked upon by the
delusions of permanence, pleasure, and self. Of these cognitive distortions, the
most deeply grounded and resistant is the delusion of self, the idea that at
the core of our being there exists a truly established "I" with which we are
essentially identified. This notion of self, the Buddha teaches, is an error, a mere
presupposition lacking a real referent. Yet, though a mere presupposition, the
idea of self is not inconsequential. To the contrary, it entails consequences
that can be calamitous. Because we make the view of self the lookout point
from which we survey the world, our minds divide everything up into the
dualities of "I" and "not I," what is "mine" and what is "not mine." Then,
trapped in these dichotomies, we fall victim to the defilements they breed,
the urges to grasp and destroy, and finally to the suffering that inevitably
follows.
<!--l. 4530--><p class="indent" >   To free ourselves from all defilements and suffering, the illusion of selfhood that
sustains them has to be dispelled, exploded by the realization of selflessness. Precisely
this is the task set for the development of wisdom. The first step along the path of
development is an analytical one. In order to uproot the view of self, the field of
experience has to be laid out in certain sets of factors, which are then methodically
investigated to ascertain that none of them singly or in combination can be taken as
a self. This analytical treatment of experience, so characteristic of the higher reaches
of Buddhist philosophical psychology, is not intended to suggest that experience, like
a watch or car, can be reduced to an accidental conglomeration of separable parts.
Experience does have an irreducible unity, but this unity is functional rather
than substantial; it does not require the postulate of a unifying self separate
from the factors, retaining its identity as a constant amidst the ceaseless
flux.
<!--l. 4546--><p class="indent" >   The method of analysis applied most often is that of the five aggregates of
clinging (panc&#8217;upadanakkhandha): material form, feeling, perception, mental
formations, and consciousness.67 Material form constitutes the material side of
existence: the bodily organism with its sense faculties and the outer objects of
cognition. The other four aggregates constitute the mental side. Feeling provides the
affective tone, perception the factor of noting and identifying, the mental formations
the volitional and emotive elements, and consciousness the basic awareness essential
to the whole occasion of experience. The analysis by way of the five aggregates paves

the way for an attempt to see experience solely in terms of its constituting factors,
without slipping in implicit references to an unfindable self. To gain this perspective
requires the development of intensive mindfulness, now applied to the fourth
foundation, the contemplation of the factors of existence (dhammanupassana).
The disciple will dwell contemplating the five aggregates, their arising and
passing:
<!--l. 4562--><p class="indent" >   The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena, namely, of the five aggregates
of clinging. He knows what material form is, how it arises, how it passes away; knows
what feeling is, how it arises, how it passes away; knows what perception is, how it
arises, how it passes away; knows what mental formations are, how they arise, how
they pass away; knows what consciousness is, how it arises, how it passes
away.68
<!--l. 4570--><p class="indent" >   Or the disciple may instead base his contemplation on the six internal and
external spheres of sense experience, that is, the six sense faculties and their
corresponding objects, also taking note of the "fetters" or defilements that arise from
such sensory contacts:
<!--l. 4575--><p class="indent" >   The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena, namely, of the six internal
and external sense bases. He knows the eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose
and odors, the tongue and tastes, the body and tangibles, the mind and
mental objects; and he knows as well the fetter that arises in dependence on
them. He understands how the unarisen fetter arises, how the arisen fetter
is abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter does not arise again in the
future.69
<!--l. 4583--><p class="indent" >   The view of self is further attenuated by examining the factors of existence, not
analytically, but in terms of their relational structure. Inspection reveals that
the aggregates exist solely in dependence on conditions. Nothing in the set
enjoys the absolute self-sufficiency of being attributed to the assumed "I."
Whatever factors in the body-mind complex be looked at, they are found to be
dependently arisen, tied to the vast net of events extending beyond themselves
temporally and spatially. The body, for example, has arisen through the union of
sperm and egg and subsists in dependence on food, water, and air. Feeling,
perception, and mental formations occur in dependence on the body with its
sense faculties. They require an object, the corresponding consciousness,
and the contact of the object with the consciousness through the media
of the sense faculties. Consciousness in its turn depends on the sentient
organism and the entire assemblage of co-arisen mental factors. This whole
process of becoming, moreover, has arisen from the previous lives in this
particular chain of existences and inherit all the accumulated kamma of the
earlier existences. Thus nothing possesses a self-sufficient mode of being. All
conditioned phenomena exist relationally, contingent and dependent on other
things.
<!--l. 4604--><p class="indent" >   The above two steps &#8212; the factorial analysis and the discernment of relations &#8212;
help cut away the intellectual adherence to the idea of self, but they lack sufficient
power to destroy the ingrained clinging to the ego sustained by erroneous perception.
To uproot this subtle form of ego-clinging requires a counteractive perception: direct
insight into the empty, coreless nature of phenomena. Such an insight is generated by

contemplating the factors of existence in terms of their three universal marks &#8212;
impermanence (aniccata), unsatisfactoriness (dukkhata), and selflessness (anattata).
Generally, the first of the three marks to be discerned is impermanence, which at
the level of insight does not mean merely that everything eventually comes
to an end. At this level it means something deeper and more pervasive,
namely, that conditioned phenomena are in constant process, happenings
which break up and perish almost as soon as they arise. The stable objects
appearing to the senses reveal themselves to be strings of momentary formations
(sankhara); the person posited by common sense dissolves into a current
made up of two intertwining streams &#8212; a stream of material events, the
aggregate of material form, and a stream of mental events, the other four
aggregates.
<!--l. 4624--><p class="indent" >   When impermanence is seen, insight into the other two marks closely follows.
Since the aggregates are constantly breaking up, we cannot pin our hopes on
them for any lasting satisfaction. Whatever expectations we lay on them
are bound to be dashed to pieces by their inevitable change. Thus when
seen with insight they are dukkha, suffering, in the deepest sense. Then, as
the aggregates are impermanent and unsatisfactory, they cannot be taken
as self. If they were self, or the belongings of a self, we would be able to
control them and bend them to our will, to make them everlasting sources of
bliss. But far from being able to exercise such mastery, we find them to
be grounds of pain and disappointment. Since they cannot be subjected
to control, these very factors of our being are anatta: not a self, not the
belongings of a self, just empty, ownerless phenomena occurring in dependence on
conditions.
<!--l. 4638--><p class="indent" >   When the course of insight practice is entered, the eight path factors become
charged with an intensity previously unknown. They gain in force and fuse together
into the unity of a single cohesive path heading towards the goal. In the practice of
insight all eight factors and three trainings co-exist; each is there supporting all the
others; each makes its own unique contribution to the work. The factors of
moral discipline hold the tendencies to transgression in check with such
care that even the thought of unethical conduct does not arise. The factors
of the concentration group keep the mind firmly fixed upon the stream of
phenomena, contemplating whatever arises with impeccable precision, free from
forgetfulness and distraction. Right view, as the wisdom of insight, grows
continually sharper and deeper; right intention shows itself in a detachment and
steadiness of purpose bringing an unruffled poise to the entire process of
contemplation.
<!--l. 4653--><p class="indent" >   Insight meditation takes as its objective sphere the "conditioned formations"
(sankhara) comprised in the five aggregates. Its task is to uncover their essential
characteristics: the three marks of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness.
Because it still deals with the world of conditioned events, the Eightfold Path in the
stage of insight is called the mundane path (lokiyamagga). This designation in no
way implies that the path of insight is concerned with mundane goals, with
achievements falling in the range of samsara. It aspires to transcendence, it leads to
liberation, but its objective domain of contemplation still lies within the conditioned

world. However, this mundane contemplation of the conditioned serves as the
vehicle for reaching the unconditioned, for attaining the supramundane.
When insight meditation reaches its climax, when it fully comprehends the
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of everything formed,
the mind breaks through the conditioned and realizes the unconditioned,
Nibbana. It sees Nibbana with direct vision, makes it an object of immediate
realization.
<!--l. 4671--><p class="indent" >   The breakthrough to the unconditioned is achieved by a type of consciousness or
mental event called the supramundane path (lokuttaramagga). The supramundane
path occurs in four stages, four "supramundane paths," each marking a deeper level
of realization and issuing in a fuller degree of liberation, the fourth and last in
complete liberation. The four paths can be achieved in close proximity to one another
&#8212; for those with extraordinarily sharp faculties even in the same sitting &#8212; or (as is
more typically the case) they can be spread out over time, even over several
lifetimes.70 The supramundane paths share in common the penetration of the Four
Noble Truths. They understand them, not conceptually, but intuitively. They grasp
them through vision, seeing them with self-validating certainty to be the
invariable truths of existence. The vision of the truths which they present is
complete at one moment. The four truths are not understood sequentially, as in
the stage of reflection when thought is the instrument of understanding.
They are seen simultaneously: to see one truth with the path is to see them
all.
<!--l. 4689--><p class="indent" >   As the path penetrates the four truths, the mind exercises four simultaneous
functions, one regarding each truth. It fully comprehends the truth of suffering,
seeing all conditioned existence as stamped with the mark of unsatisfactoriness. At
the same time it abandons craving, cuts through the mass of egotism and desire that
repeatedly gives birth to suffering. Again, the mind realizes cessation, the deathless
element Nibbana, now directly present to the inner eye. And fourthly, the mind
develops the Noble Eightfold Path, whose eight factors spring up endowed with
tremendous power, attained to supramundane stature: right view as the direct seeing
of Nibbana, right intention as the mind&#8217;s application to Nibbana, the triad of ethical
factors as the checks on moral transgression, right effort as the energy in the
path-consciousness, right mindfulness as the factor of awareness, and right
concentration as the mind&#8217;s one-pointed focus. This ability of the mind to
perform four functions at the same moment is compared to a candle&#8217;s ability to
simultaneously burn the wick, consume the wax, dispel darkness, and give
light.71
<!--l. 4707--><p class="indent" >   The supramundane paths have the special task of eradicating the defilements.
Prior to the attainment of the paths, in the stages of concentration and even insight
meditation, the defilements were not cut off but were only debilitated, checked and
suppressed by the training of the higher mental faculties. Beneath the surface they
continued to linger in the form of latent tendencies. But when the supramundane
paths are reached, the work of eradication begins.
<!--l. 4715--><p class="indent" >   Insofar as they bind us to the round of becoming, the defilements are classified
into a set of ten "fetters" (samyojana) as follows: (1) personality view, (2) doubt,
(3) clinging to rules and rituals, (4) sensual desire, (5) aversion, (6) desire

for fine-material existence, (7) desire for immaterial existence, (8) conceit,
(9) restlessness, and (10) ignorance. The four supramundane paths each
eliminate a certain layer of defilements. The first, the path of stream-entry
(sotapatti-magga), cuts off the first three fetters, the coarsest of the set, eliminates
them so they can never arise again. "Personality view" (sakkaya-ditthi), the
view of a truly existent self in the five aggregates, is cut off since one sees
the selfless nature of all phenomena. Doubt is eliminated because one has
grasped the truth proclaimed by the Buddha, seen it for oneself, and so can
never again hang back due to uncertainty. And clinging to rules and rites is
removed since one knows that deliverance can be won only through the
practice of the Eightfold Path, not through rigid moralism or ceremonial
observances.
<!--l. 4733--><p class="indent" >   The path is followed immediately by another state of supramundane consciousness
known as the fruit (phala), which results from the path&#8217;s work of cutting off
defilements. Each path is followed by its own fruit, wherein for a few moments the
mind enjoys the blissful peace of Nibbana before descending again to the
level of mundane consciousness. The first fruit is the fruit of stream-entry,
and a person who has gone through the experience of this fruit becomes a
"stream-enterer" (sotapanna). He has entered the stream of the Dhamma
carrying him to final deliverance. He is bound for liberation and can no
longer fall back into the ways of an unenlightened worldling. He still has
certain defilements remaining in his mental makeup, and it may take him
as long as seven more lives to arrive at the final goal, but he has acquired
the essential realization needed to reach it, and there is no way he can fall
away.
<!--l. 4748--><p class="indent" >   An enthusiastic practitioner with sharp faculties, after reaching stream-entry, does
not relax his striving but puts forth energy to complete the entire path as swiftly as
possible. He resumes his practice of insight contemplation, passes through the
ascending stages of insight-knowledge, and in time reaches the second path, the path
of the once-returner (sakadagami-magga). This supramundane path does not totally
eradicate any of the fetters, but it attenuates the roots of greed, aversion, and
delusion. Following the path the meditator experiences its fruit, then emerges as a
"once-returner" who will return to this world at most only one more time before
attaining full liberation.
<!--l. 4760--><p class="indent" >   But our practitioner again takes up the task of contemplation. At the next stage
of supramundane realization he attains the third path, the path of the non-returner
(anagami-magga), with which he cuts off the two fetters of sensual desire and ill will.
From that point on he can never again fall into the grip of any desire for sense
pleasure, and can never be aroused to anger, aversion, or discontent. As a
non-returner he will not return to the human state of existence in any future life. If
he does not reach the last path in this very life, then after death he will be reborn
in a higher sphere in the fine-material world (rupaloka) and there reach
deliverance.
<!--l. 4771--><p class="indent" >   But our meditator again puts forth effort, develops insight, and at its climax
enters the fourth path, the path of arahatship (arahatta-magga). With this path he
cuts off the five remaining fetters &#8212; desire for fine-material existence and desire for

immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. The first is the desire for
rebirth into the celestial planes made accessible by the four jhanas, the planes
commonly subsumed under the name "the Brahma-world." The second is the desire
for rebirth into the four immaterial planes made accessible by the achievement of the
four immaterial attainments. Conceit (mana) is not the coarse type of pride to which
we become disposed through an over-estimation of our virtues and talents, but the
subtle residue of the notion of an ego which subsists even after conceptually explicit
views of self have been eradicated. The texts refer to this type of conceit
as the conceit "I am" (asmimana). Restlessness (uddhacca) is the subtle
excitement which persists in any mind not yet completely enlightened, and
ignorance (avijja) is the fundamental cognitive obscuration which prevents full
understanding of the Four Noble Truths. Although the grosser grades of
ignorance have been scoured from the mind by the wisdom faculty in the
first three paths, a thin veil of ignorance overlays the truths even in the
non-returner.
<!--l. 4793--><p class="indent" >   The path of arahatship strips away this last veil of ignorance and, with it, all the
residual mental defilements. This path issues in perfect comprehension of the Four
Noble Truths. It fully fathoms the truth of suffering; eradicates the craving from
which suffering springs; realizes with complete clarity the unconditioned element,
Nibbana, as the cessation of suffering; and consummates the development of the eight
factors of the Noble Eightfold Path.
<!--l. 4801--><p class="indent" >   With the attainment of the fourth path and fruit the disciple emerges as an
arahant, one who in this very life has been liberated from all bonds. The arahant has
walked the Noble Eightfold Path to its end and lives in the assurance stated so often
in the formula from the Pali canon: "Destroyed is birth; the holy life has been lived;
what had to be done has been done; there is no coming back to any state of being."
The arahant is no longer a practitioner of the path but its living embodiment.
Having developed the eight factors of the path to their consummation, the
Liberated One lives in the enjoyment of their fruits, enlightenment and final
deliverance.
<!--l. 4812--><p class="indent" >   Epilogue
<!--l. 4814--><p class="indent" >   This completes our survey of the Noble Eightfold Path, the way to deliverance
from suffering taught by the Buddha. The higher reaches of the path may seem
remote from us in our present position, the demands of practice may appear difficult
to fulfill. But even if the heights of realization are now distant, all that we need to
reach them lies just beneath our feet. The eight factors of the path are always
accessible to us; they are mental components which can be established in the mind
simply through determination and effort. We have to begin by straightening
out our views and clarifying our intentions. Then we have to purify our
conduct &#8212; our speech, action, and livelihood. Taking these measures as our
foundation, we have to apply ourselves with energy and mindfulness to the
cultivation of concentration and insight. The rest is a matter of gradual
practice and gradual progress, without expecting quick results. For some
progress may be rapid, for others it may be slow, but the rate at which
progress occurs should not cause elation or discouragement. Liberation is the
inevitable fruit of the path and is bound to blossom forth when there is steady

and persistent practice. The only requirements for reaching the final goal
are two: to start and to continue. If these requirements are met there is
no doubt the goal will be attained. This is the Dhamma, the undeviating
law.

<!--l. 4984--><p class="indent" >   1.Ignorance is actually identical in nature with the unwholesome root "delusion"
(moha). When the Buddha speaks in a psychological context about mental factors, he
generally uses the word "delusion"; when he speaks about the causal basis of
samsara, he uses the word "ignorance" (avijja).2.SN 56:11; Word of the Buddha, p.

kama usually means sensual desire, the context seems to allow a wider interpretation,
as self-seeking desire in all its forms.16.AN 1:16.2.17.Strictly speaking, greed or desire
(raga) becomes immoral only when it impels actions violating the basic principles of
ethics, such as killing, stealing, adultery, etc. When it remains merely as a mental
factor or issues in actions not inherently immoral &#8212; e.g., the enjoyment
of good food, the desire for recognition, sexual relations that do not hurt
others &#8212; it is not immoral but is still a form of craving causing bondage to
suffering.18.For a full account of the dukkha tied up with sensual desire, see MN
13.19.This might appear to contradict what we said earlier, that metta is
free from self-reference. The contradiction is only apparent, however, for
in developing metta towards oneself one regards oneself objectively, as a
third person. Further, the kind of love developed is not self-cherishing but a
detached altruistic wish for one&#8217;s own well-being.20.Any other formula found
to be effective may be used in place of the formula given here. For a full

first edition of this book I stated here that the four paths have to be passed through
sequentially, such that there is no attainment of a higher path without first having
reached the paths below it. This certainly seems to be the position of the
Commentaries. However, the Suttas sometimes show individuals proceeding directly
from the stage of worldling to the third or even the fourth path and fruit. Though the
commentator explains that they passed through each preceding path and fruit in
rapid succession, the canonical texts themselves give no indication that this
has transpired but suggest an immediate realization of the higher stages
without the intermediate attainment of the lower stages.71.See Vism. XXII,
92-103.
