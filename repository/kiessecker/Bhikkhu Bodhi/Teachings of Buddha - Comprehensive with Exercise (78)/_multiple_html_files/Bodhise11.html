<!--l. 44036--><p class="indent" >   Here, O, Monks, a disciple lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with
thoughts of unselfish joy, and so the second, and so the third, and so the fourth. And
thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, everywhere and equally, he
continues to pervade with a heart of unselfish joy, abundant, grown great,
measureless, without hostility or ill-will.

<!--l. 44057--><p class="indent" >   by Nyanaponika Thera
<!--l. 44059--><p class="indent" >   The virtue of mudita [muditaa],1 i.e., finding joy in the happiness and
success of others, has not received sufficient attention either in expositions of
Buddhist ethics, or in the meditative development of the four sublime states
(brahma-vihara [brahma-vihaara]), of which mudita is one. It was, therefore,
thought desirable to compile this little book of essays and texts and to mention
in this introduction a few supplementary features of this rather neglected
subject.
<!--l. 44067--><p class="indent" >   It has been rightly stated that it is relatively easier for man to feel compassion or
friendliness in situations which demand them, than to cherish a spontaneous feeling
of shared joy, outside a narrow circle of one&#8217;s family and friends. It mostly requires a
deliberate effort to identify oneself with the joys and successes of others.
Yet the capacity of doing so has psychological roots in man&#8217;s nature which
may be even deeper that his compassionate responses. There is firstly the
fact that people do like to feel happy (with &#8212; or without &#8212; good reason)
and would prefer it to the shared sadness of compassion. Man&#8217;s gregarious
nature (his "sociability") already gives him some familiarity with shared
emotions and shared pleasure, though mostly on a much lower level than
that of our present concern. There is also in man (and in some animals)
not only an aggressive impulse, but also a natural bent towards mutual aid
and co-operative action. Furthermore, there is the fact that happiness is

infectious and an unselfish joy can easily grow out of it. Children readily
respond by their own smiles and happy mood to smiling faces and happiness
around them. Though children can be quite jealous and envious at times,
they also can visibly enjoy it when they have made a playmate happy by a
little gift and they are then quite pleased with themselves. Let parents and
educators wisely encourage this potential in the child. Then this seed will
quite naturally grow into a strong plant in the adolescent and the adult,
maturing from impulsive and simple manifestations into the sublime state of
unselfish joy (mudita-brahmavihara). Thus, here too, the child may become
"the father of a man." Such education towards joy with others should, of
course, not be given in a dry didactic manner, but chiefly in a practical way
by gently making the child observe, appreciate, and enjoy the happiness
and success of others, and by trying himself to create a little joy in others.
This can be aided by acquainting the child with examples of selfless lives
and actions for his joyful admiration of them (and these, of course, should
not be limited to Buddhist history). This feature should not be absent in
Buddhist youth literature and schoolbooks, throughout all age groups. And
this theme should be continued in Buddhist magazines and literature for
adults.
<!--l. 44103--><p class="indent" >   Admittedly, the negative impulses in man, like aggression, envy, jealousy, etc., are
much more in evidence than his positive tendencies towards communal service,
mutual aid, unselfish joy, generous appreciation of the good qualities of his
fellow-men, etc. Yet, as all these positive features are definitely found in man (though
rarely developed), it is quite realistic to appeal to them, and activate and develop
that potential by whatever means we can, in our personal relationships, in
education, etc. "If it were impossible to cultivate the Good, I would not
tell you to do so," said the Buddha. This is, indeed, a positive, optimistic
assurance.
<!--l. 44114--><p class="indent" >   If this potential for unselfish joy is widely and methodically encouraged and
developed, starting with the Buddhist child (or, for that matter, with any child) and
continued with adults (individuals and Buddhist groups, including the Sangha), the
seed of mudita can grow into a strong plant which will blossom forth and
find fruition in many other virtues, as a kind of beneficial "chain reaction":
magnanimity, tolerance, generosity (of both heart and purse), friendliness, and
compassion. When unselfish joy grows, many noxious weeds in the human heart
will die a natural death (or will, at least, shrink): jealousy and envy, ill will
in various degrees and manifestations, cold-heartedness, miserliness (also
in one&#8217;s concern for others), and so forth. Unselfish joy can, indeed, act
as a powerful agent in releasing dormant forces of the Good in the human
heart.
<!--l. 44128--><p class="indent" >   We know very well how envy and jealousy (the chief opponents of unselfish joy)
can poison a man&#8217;s character as well as the social relationships on many levels of his
life. They can paralyze the productivity of society, on governmental, professional,
industrial, and commercial levels. Should not, therefore, all effort be made to
cultivate their antidote, that is mudita?
<!--l. 44135--><p class="indent" >   Mudita will also vitalize and ennoble charitable and social work. While

compassion (karuna [karu.naa]) is, or should be, the inspiration for it, unselfish joy
should be its boon companion. Mudita will prevent compassionate action from being
marred by a condescending and patronizing attitude which often repels or hurts the
recipient. Also, when active compassion and unselfish joy go together, it will be less
likely that works of service turn into dead routine performed indifferently.
Indifference, listlessness, boredom (all nuances of the Pali term arati) are said to be
the &#8217;distant enemies&#8217; of mudita. They can be vanquished by an alliance of compassion
and unselfish joy.
<!--l. 44146--><p class="indent" >   In him who gives and helps, the joy he finds in such action will enhance the
blessings imparted by these wholesome deeds: unselfishness will become more and
more natural to him, and such ethical unselfishness will help him towards a better
appreciation and the final realization of the Buddha&#8217;s central doctrine of No-self
(anatta [anattaa]). He will also find it confirmed that he who is joyful in
his heart will gain easier the serenity of a concentrated mind. These are,
indeed, great blessings which the cultivation of joy with others&#8217; happiness can
bestow!
<!--l. 44156--><p class="indent" >   Nowadays, moral exhortations fall increasingly on deaf ears, whether they are
motivated theologically or otherwise. Preaching morals with an admonishing finger is
now widely resented and rejected. This fact worries greatly the churches and
educators in the West. But there are ample indications that this may, more or less,
happen also in the Buddhist countries of the East where ethics is still taught and
preached in the old hortatory style and mostly in a rather stereotype and
unimaginative way, with little reference to present-day moral and social
problems. Hence modern youth will increasingly feel that such "moralizings"
are not their concern. In fact within the frame of the Buddhist teachings
which do not rely on the authoritarian commandments of God and church,
but on man&#8217;s innate capacity for self-purification, such conventionalized
presentation of ethics which chiefly relies on over-worked scriptural references,
must appear quite incongruous and will prove increasingly ineffective for
young and old alike. The need for reform in this field is urgent and of vital
importance.
<!--l. 44174--><p class="indent" >   It was also with this situation in view, that the preceding observations have
stressed the fact that a virtue like unselfish and altruistic joy has its natural roots in
the human heart and can be of immediate benefit to the individual and society. In
other words, the approach to a modern presentation of Buddhist ethics should be
pragmatic and contemporary, enlivened by a genuine and warm-hearted human
concern.
<!--l. 44181--><p class="indent" >   In this troubled world of ours, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughts and
deeds of compassion; but there seem to be all too few for sharing in others&#8217; joy. Hence
it is necessary for us to create new opportunities for unselfish joy, by the active
practice of loving-kindness (metta [mettaa]) and compassion (karuna), in deeds,
words, and meditative thought. Yet, in a world that can never be without
disappointments and failures, we must also arm ourselves with the equanimity
(upekkha [upekkhaa]) to protect us from discouragement and feelings of frustration,
should we encounter difficulties in our efforts to expand the realm of unselfish
joy.

<!--l. 44196--><p class="indent" >   Unselfish Joy: A Neglected Virtue
<!--l. 44198--><p class="indent" >   by Natasha Jackson
<!--l. 44200--><p class="indent" >   (From Metta, The Journal of the Buddhist Federation of Australia, Vol. 12, No.
2.)
<!--l. 44203--><p class="indent" >   Mudita &#8212; unselfish or sympathetic joy &#8212; is one of the most neglected topics
within the whole range of the Buddha Dhamma, probably because of its subtlety and
of the wealth of nuances latent within it. Besides getting honorable mention within
the context of The Four Divine Abidings (brahma-vihara), few commentators have
had much more to say about it apart from explaining that it means "sympathetic joy
at the good fortune or success of others." Only one notable writer, Conze (in
Buddhist Thought in India), has had the insight to suggest that mudita, i.e.
sympathy, is a pre-requisite of metta (loving-kindness) and of karuna (compassion).
He thus names appreciation as one of the components of mudita. How right he is! For
one cannot appreciate another person without seeing some good in him. If one does
not appreciate the other person in the slightest degree, one would be hard
put to experience joy at any stroke of good fortune or success that may
befall him. To stimulate feelings of pleasure when, in fact, one feels none,
would be the grossest of hypocrisy. Thus, mudita tacitly implies looking for
the good in others and learning to recognize and admire what good there
is.
<!--l. 44222--><p class="indent" >   Likewise, if one has a misanthropic view of mankind, regarding people as
essentially evil and not worth being concerned about, one cannot, on the face of it,
make much headway with any of The Four Divine Abidings. To have a sympathetic
attitude towards human beings does not betoken an idealization of man, but rather a
realistic appraisal: that, though often in error and grievously at fault, man has,
nevertheless, the potential to rise above his darkness and ignorance into the light of
knowledge and even to undreamed of heights of Nirvana. Unless one has that
measure of faith and confidence in mankind which the Buddha himself had, the
practice of metta and karuna is impossible. Thus, the broadest and most simple
aspect of mudita as sympathy towards mankind, is also the most basic and
important.
<!--l. 44235--><p class="indent" >   To regard mudita as being relevant only on certain relatively rare occasions when
our friends and acquaintances come into a bonanza of some kind, is to fragment it
and render it trivial, thereby missing the essential matrix. It should not be regarded
as a matter of turning on a tap from which mudita will gush forth. There should be,
in a certain sense, a quiet stream of sympathy and understanding flowing
within the individual all the time. Though, to be sure, it does also mean
developing the capacity to participate in another person&#8217;s finest hour and doing so
spontaneously and sincerely. It is indeed a depressing fact that people are much more
ready to sympathize with the misfortunes of others than to rejoice with
them, a psychological quirk in people which wrung from Montaigne the ironic
statement:
<!--l. 44248--><p class="indent" >   There is something altogether not too displeasing in the misfortunes of our
friends.

<!--l. 44251--><p class="indent" >   Turning back to the essential matrix of mudita as sympathy towards mankind,
faith in its potential for good and acceptance of its worthwhileness, this is precisely
what is lacking in the world today. There is abroad a kind of cosmic gloom and,
among some large sections of people, a feeling of defeatism. Probably the
scene is largely colored by the shadow of the hydrogen bomb and the various
other horrible weapons of destruction which we know the nations are so busy
in manufacturing. All in all, too much has happened in too short a time.
More scientific and technological discoveries have been telescoped into the
last fifty (or is it thirty?) years than in the previous five hundred, and the
total result is, at the moment, of dubious benefit to humanity as a whole,
though of inestimable worth to the new millionaires who have managed
to muscle in on the expanding economy. Electric and nuclear power, the
spectacular forging ahead of communication, transport and industry have
brought in their wake such negative by-products as over-population, more and
more urbanization into colossal, concentrated centers, such as Tokyo, New
York, and London (and even Sydney and Melbourne), which, in turn, has
given rise to other unfortunate results, both physical, and psychological:
pollution from industrial waste, destruction of natural resources; individual
de-socialization, alienation, stress, as evidenced by the delinquency figures,
the drift to drugs, character disorders, feelings of the meaninglessness of
life, rise in crime, wanton destructiveness (a sure symptom of frustration
and an unlived life), despair, suicide. We know that such ills have always
existed in society, and that probably they always will to some degree, but the
frightening thing about the present situation is that they are insidiously
increasing, in spite of the fact that many people, and especially the youth,
have never had it so good. As it is, man feels more insecure than ever, more
uncertain and lost. Viewing these symptoms, many people throughout the
world have drawn the conclusion that man has arrived at the period of moral
decline and disintegration and that humanity has become so depraved as to
be hopelessly beyond redemption or recall. Such a view has always been
characteristic of old age. We can, with a certain degree of amusement read the
lines:
<!--l. 44286--><p class="indent" >   To whom do I speak today? Brothers are evil, Friends today are not of love. To
whom do I speak today? Hearts are thievish, Every man seizes his neighbor&#8217;s
goods. To whom do I speak today? The gentle man perishes, The bold-faced
goes everywhere... To whom do I speak today? When a man should arouse
wrath by his evil conduct, He stirs all men to mirth, although his iniquity is
wicked...
<!--l. 44293--><p class="indent" >   The above admonition was composed in ancient Egypt during the Middle
Kingdom, thousands of years ago, but the words are those which every generation
hears.
<!--l. 44297--><p class="indent" >   There is a proneness in periods of crisis and transition, to conjure up in the mind
a fantasy of a previous golden age, when people were of sterling worth and life was
lived in accordance with the noble virtues. But, we may well ask, when was there
such an age, and where? If people who harbor such quaint notions were to read
history, they would realize that such a belief is just about as valid as that there ever

was a time "when flowers bloomed for ever and sweethearts were always
true," in the words of the old song. Ancient history and the Middle Ages are
definitely OUT as far as morality is concerned. Without going so far back,
merely a couple of hundred years, Smollett wrote this of eighteenth century
England:
<!--l. 44309--><p class="indent" >   Commerce and manufacture flourished to such a degree of increase as has never
been known in this island; but this advantage was attended with an irresistible tide
of luxury and excess which flowed through all degrees of people, breaking
down all the bounds of civil policy, and opening a way for licentiousness
and immorality. The highways were infested with rapine and assassination;
the cities teemed with the brutal votaries of lewdness, intemperance, and
profligacy.
<!--l. 44317--><p class="indent" >   In the nineteenth century (relatively recently), Wordsworth wrote:
<!--l. 44319--><p class="indent" >   The wealthiest man among us is the best: No grandeur now in nature or in book
Delight us. Rapine, avarice, expense, This is idolatry; and these we adore. Plain
living and high thinking are no more; The homely beauty of the good old
cause Is gone, our fearful innocence, And pure religion breathing household
laws.
<!--l. 44325--><p class="indent" >   And James Hemming, a modern writer in his book Individual Morality:
<!--l. 44327--><p class="indent" >   Nineteenth-century London was frequently shaken by the destructive antics of
informally organized hooligan gangs of young aristocrats. Those young roughs,
having idled away their days, spent their nights beating people up, smashing up
coffee stalls, alarming women and such like &#8212; the Bucks, the Corinthians, and all
their imitators and hangers-on. Such bands were following, somewhat less cruelly, in
the tradition of the nefarious Mohocks, who terrorized eighteenth-century
London.
<!--l. 44336--><p class="indent" >   Sexual propriety? Quoting again from Hemming:
<!--l. 44338--><p class="indent" >   Brothels in the nineteenth century were big business, and, laws to forbid living on
the immoral earnings of women, after several rebuffs in Parliament, did not reach the
statute books till 1885.
<!--l. 44342--><p class="indent" >   But this was in England, the most progressive country in Europe. There is no
evidence for believing that conditions were better on the Continent.
<!--l. 44345--><p class="indent" >   Understandably, twenty-five years after World War II, we are still appalled by the
memory of the Nazi gas-chambers and the genocide which was their aim. This is by
no means an isolated instance of genocide. History bears witness to similar incidents
of destructive hate, culminating in mass murder. The Albigenses were wiped out to a
man, and in 1572, at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Eve, thousands of
Huguenots were slaughtered, Pope Gregory XIII commanding bonfires to be lit and a
medal to be struck in celebration! The idea that the mass destruction of one&#8217;s
ideological enemies is justified was already old in the days of the Old Testament. Saul
was commanded:
<!--l. 44356--><p class="indent" >   Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them
not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and
ass.
<!--l. 44360--><p class="indent" >   All of the foregoing is not intended as apologetics justifying violence, bloodbaths,
or individual or collective acts of immorality but merely to dispel the myth that there

was ever a previous idyllic phase, when man could have said with some semblance of
truth:
<!--l. 44365--><p class="indent" >   God&#8217;s in His Heaven And all&#8217;s right with the world.
<!--l. 44367--><p class="indent" >   So, let us lay to rest forever the belief that in the past men were truer, kinder,
more upright, and generally more worthy than they are today. Let us give that piece
of romantic fiction the respectable funeral that it deserves. Our ancestors and
predecessors were no better than we are, and we are certainly not worse than they
were. In many respects we have improved considerably on the ways of our forbears.
Actually, there has been a great deal of progress, considering that slavery hung
on in England until 1772, in America till 1863, and serfdom in Russia till
1861. And, in spite of the injustices and lack of moral scruples that still
exist, there is more awareness, kindliness, and sensitivity in many human
societies than there has ever been before. Today when a national disaster
of great magnitude occurs in a country, quite often the rest of the world
rallies around and helps &#8212; perhaps not to the extent that it should, but
nonetheless, to some extent. Such a broadening expansion of the human
conscience would have been deemed a Utopian ideal in former times and
impossible.
<!--l. 44384--><p class="indent" >   When acts of genocide were perpetrated in the past, people just accepted
it: that was that, and there was nothing to be done about it. In our time,
the whole world was revolted by the Nazi gas-chambers, eventually rose
against the loathsome disease of Fascism and smashed it even thought it
took the combined might of the allied force five years of bitter conflict to do
so.
<!--l. 44391--><p class="indent" >   However, in the past, without exception, whatever was inflicted upon a people,
they mostly took. Today they don&#8217;t &#8212; they protest, they demonstrate, they kick up
a fuss. They have become articulate because they have realized that the greatest evil
of all is not poverty, racialism, or war but powerlessness. Naturally, such an
unexpected show of interest in public affairs is embarrassing to governments
accustomed to an inert and docile population and there is some wistful talk by
diehards of "the silent majority," but the present indications are that "the silent
majority" is likely to become a silent minority in the face of such urgent problems as
over-population, and destruction of natural resources, which, if left unchecked, will
make the earth uninhabitable within a foreseeable future. However, against this
general tendency is the lamentable fact that nothing was done about the rape
of Tibet, and even now there are no large-scale or forceful protests being
made about the genocide that is being practiced in that country by the
Chinese.
<!--l. 44408--><p class="indent" >   So, far from feeling dejected and dispirited about mankind, we should be hopeful
and buoyant. There would be infinitely more cause for alarm and despair if people
were as easy to manipulate as sheep or merely apathetic. The arguing and the
restlessness throughout the world is about the principles on which we should run our
lives, a struggle for values other than the profit motive, for ways and means to make
possible greater co-operation between individuals and nations, and for moral
maturity in coping with man&#8217;s new powers and responsibilities. People discuss, argue,
petition, protest, demonstrate because of their sympathy, compassion, and love for

mankind. It is very difficult to differentiate between the three or to recognize
precisely the line of demarcation where one ends and the other begins, because they
are illimitable. There are, of course, others who see in these conflicts only hatred
but this view is hardly tenable because it is much easier and much more
comfortable to remain uninvolved, drifting with the current, nor swimming against
it.
<!--l. 44425--><p class="indent" >   The Ven. Nyanaponika has summed up the interdependence of the Four Divine
Abidings in the following quotation:
<!--l. 44428--><p class="indent" >   Love imparts to equanimity its selflessness, its boundless nature and even its
fervor...
<!--l. 44431--><p class="indent" >   Compassion guards equanimity from falling into cold indifference and keeps it
from indolent or selfish isolation. Until equanimity has reached perfection,
compassion urges it to enter again and again into the battlefields of the
world.
<!--l. 44436--><p class="indent" >   Sympathetic joy gives to equanimity the mild serenity that softens its stern
appearance. It is the divine smile on the face of the Enlightened One.
<!--l. 44440--><p class="indent" >   From The Four Sublime States in The Wheel No. 6.
<!--l. 44442--><p class="indent" >   Mudita
<!--l. 44444--><p class="indent" >   by C.F. Knight
<!--l. 44446--><p class="indent" >   (From From Metta, Vol. 12, No. 2.)
<!--l. 44448--><p class="indent" >   A feature of the Buddha-Dhamma is cognizance of the pairs of opposites in the
training to get beyond them. The Buddha&#8217;s method of mental training and
development was to teach by first defining unwholesome or unskillful thoughts,
words, and deeds, or practices which characterize many of man&#8217;s proclivities, and
then to propound their opposites of a wholesome or skillful nature as an achievement
to be sought after for the abolition of them both, eventually, when even the good
must be left behind as well as the evil; when even the Raft of Dhamma is to be
abandoned &#8212; after crossing the flood of samsara. The trouble with so many of the
unwise is their desire to abandon the Raft of Dhamma before reaching the further
shore. The Buddha&#8217;s method of expounding the negative and the positive, the
passive, and the dynamic aspects of behavior, in both abstract and concrete
terms, is obviously to create awareness of what is to be sought after and
nurtured.
<!--l. 44464--><p class="indent" >   The basic ignorance featured in Buddhism is not so much a rejection of the
truth as it is a failure to perceive it. It is, as it were, a "blind spot" in our
perception akin to the physical damage of a section of the brain or the nervous
system which results in impaired vision or locomotion. In other words, the
depth of our ignorance may be measured by our lack of consciousness of
it.
<!--l. 44472--><p class="indent" >   This is why it is so necessary that we should see and recognize our failings
and shortcomings if we are to eradicate them. It is also important that we
should be mindful of "the good that has arisen," and to foster and develop it
to the point of perfection. To realize our imperfections is the beginning of
wisdom &#8212; the first light to shine on the darkness of our ignorance. While
we are blissfully unaware of unwholesome states of mind within ourselves,
such states will continue to flourish, and their roots will dig deeper into

our very being. Just so too, in our relationships with our fellow men, the
unperceived evils will be repeated unconsciously and unrecognized, building
up a cumulative unhappy future for us under the retributive causal law of
karma.
<!--l. 44485--><p class="indent" >   In dealing with mudita or altruistic joy, we are once more to some extent
frustrated with the inadequacy of translations for "brahma-vihara" or "appamañña"
[appama~n~na] &#8212; the former as "sublime or divine abode," and the latter as
"boundless state." To reduce either of these terms to modern idiom is difficult. The
four characteristics grouped under these terms are: loving-kindness, compassion,
altruistic joy, and equanimity, extended to universal application. In their perfection
they are "sublime" and "boundless," and to be "dwelt in" as one speaks of "dwelling
in Peace," so we will leave it at that.
<!--l. 44498--><p class="indent" >   As with all perfections, these four desirable characteristics are the antidotes to the
poisons of their opposite imperfections, and here is where the recognition of their
opposites is apposite. Less has been said or written of mudita than of the other three
of these four characteristics, perhaps, again, because of its somewhat clumsy
translation. While loving-kindness and compassion are objective, reaching out to all
sentient beings, mudita and equanimity are subjective, or personal in their
application.
<!--l. 44507--><p class="indent" >   It may seem strange at first, until we critically examine the source, to speak
of either selfish or unselfish joy. Joy is an emotional ecstasy arising from
pleasure. It is something intensely personal. While we can and do share our
pleasures to some extent with others, the resultant impact of them on various
personalities will vary as widely as the personalities. At times what may give rise
to rapturous joy in us, when shared, may give rise to positive aversion in
another.
<!--l. 44515--><p class="indent" >   A pertinent example of this would be the reactionary effect of certain music on
people of differing tastes. While it is not uncommon for some of the modern
generation to literally swoon in ecstasy under the influence of the combination of
discordant and dissonant notes and chords, others find them anything but
entertaining or pleasurable. Here we have what might be termed "selfish joy" on the
part of the participants, by those who have to suffer most unwilling participation. For
all that, within the group enjoying it, there is a reciprocity of delight, happiness, and
rapture between the entertainers and the entertained. Superficially, then, we could
say it is not the phenomenon of joy itself, that is either selfish or altruistic by nature,
but that time, place, and circumstance must all be considered in relation one to the
others.
<!--l. 44529--><p class="indent" >   However, to bring mudita within the ambit of the Buddha-Dhamma we need to
go deeper into the necessity for cultivating this perfection. What are the opposites to
be eliminated by its cultivation?
<!--l. 44533--><p class="indent" >   We never tire of asserting the interdependence of every aspect of the
Buddha-Dhamma, no matter which particular facet is being discussed. We have
already stated that ignorance is failure of perception, and it is true that greed and
hatred do arise through the non-perception of their source and subsequent results;
that basically craving born of ignorance is the culprit, and that the purpose of the
Buddha-Dhamma is to eliminate craving. It is craving that gives rise to

jealousy, envy, covetousness, avarice, and greed in all of its manifestations. Here
it is that mudita when practiced and developed becomes a "sublime" and
"boundless" state of mind to be "dwelt in" as a corrective characteristic for their
removal.
<!--l. 44545--><p class="indent" >   One of the most frequently used similes by the Buddha was that of fire. At times
it was the destructive quality of fire that was likened to the destructive nature of the
passions. At other times it was the ardent nature of fire that was to be emulated in
the pursuance of the path to holiness. In its uncontrolled existence fire is a
destructive danger. Under control it is one of man&#8217;s greatest boons and blessings. In
either case it was a motivating force to be reckoned with, at all times active, potent,
and energetic.
<!--l. 44554--><p class="indent" >   The three roots of evil &#8212; greed, hatred, and delusion &#8212; are also known as "the
three fires." On one occasion the Buddha and his band of monks were for the time
staying on Gaya Head, a mountain near the city of Gaya. From their elevated
position they watched one of the great fires that from time to time ravaged the
countryside. This inspired what is known as "The Fire Sermon," which is the third
recorded discourse delivered by the Buddha subsequent to his Enlightenment, and at
the beginning of his long ministry. To the Buddha, the world of Samsara was like the
flaming plains below, "Everything is burning," said the Buddha, "burning with the
fire of passion, with the fired of hatred, with the fire of stupidity." (Vin.
21)
<!--l. 44568--><p class="indent" >   It is these three fires that give rise to jealousy, envy, covetousness, avarice, and
greed. The craving for possessions, the craving for sensual pleasures, the begrudged
success of others, the hatred that is begotten by the gains of others, the odious
comparison of greater status compared with our humble circumstances, these are the
"fires" that burn within us to our undoing.
<!--l. 44575--><p class="indent" >   It is now evident why mudita is such an important characteristic to be cultivated.
When we can view the success of others with the same equanimity, and to the same
extent, as we would extend metta and karuna &#8212; loving-kindness and compassion &#8212;
to those who suffer grief and distress, sadness and tribulation, sorrow and
mourning, then we are beginning to exercise mudita, and are in the process of
eradicating greed and craving. Developed still further, we can reach the
stage of sharing with others their joy of possession, their financial or social
successes, their elevation to positions of civic or national importance, or their
receipt of titles and honorifics. In such a manner mudita is counteractive
to conceits of all kinds, and its growth and development checks craving&#8217;s
grip.
<!--l. 44588--><p class="indent" >   Until we have developed this subjective characteristic within ourselves how can we
develop the objective characteristics of metta and karuna? The accumulated
possessions, results of our greed, may give us the pleasure and the happiness of the
miser gloating over his hoard of gold. The happiness born of shared pleasures, shared
love, shared possessions, shared delights in another&#8217;s success, will surpass the meager
selfish happiness of the miser.
<!--l. 44596--><p class="indent" >   Unselfish joy multiplies in ratio to the extension of its application, quite apart
from its purifying effect on our own lives.
<!--l. 44599--><p class="indent" >   In Ñanamoli&#8217;s translation of Buddhaghosa&#8217;s Visuddhimagga he uses "gladness" for

mudita, with the footnote: "Mudita &#8212; gladness &#8212; as one of the divine abidings is
always used in the sense of gladness at others&#8217; success." Buddhaghosa illustrates this
by saying: "On seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy cheerful and glad,
gladness can be aroused thus: &#8217;This being is indeed glad. How good! How excellent!&#8217;
Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved person, so he pervades all
being with gladness."
<!--l. 44609--><p class="indent" >   In "The Analysis of the Sixfold Sense-Field" (MN 137) the Buddha speaks of
the six joys connected with renunciation. While such joys are subjective by
nature, they are devoid of any taint of egoistic craving that could give rise
to the cankers of jealousy, envy, covetousness, or greed. These joys arise
on the realization of the impermanence of material shapes, sounds, smells,
flavors, touches, and mental states, and the renunciation of attachment to
them.
<!--l. 44617--><p class="indent" >   The Nature and Implications of Mudita
<!--l. 44619--><p class="indent" >   by L.R. Oates
<!--l. 44621--><p class="indent" >   (From From Metta, Vol. 12, No. 2.)
<!--l. 44623--><p class="indent" >   Altruistic joy is one of the four "sublime states" of mind &#8212; friendliness,
compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity &#8212; which together form one related
group among the various spiritual or physical exercises generally described
as meditation or contemplation. These all have as their common aim the
attainment of mental calm or equanimity, which is intended in turn to foster the
development of liberating insight. "A still mind, like still water, yields a clear
reflection of what is before it." This is why this particular series ends with
equanimity, but the route by which it is attained in this case is different
from that traversed for the most of the other themes used as a focus for
concentration.
<!--l. 44636--><p class="indent" >   The others, such as meditation on the breath, on death, on visual objects (kasina
[kasi.na]), or on the Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Order of the Enlightened One, are
entirely concerned with the self-cultivation of the meditator. Most of these themes
are abstract or inanimate, while the Buddha and the Order (in the strict sense
applicable here) have transcended any power of ours to help or hinder them. So the
only person concerned or affected in these forms of training is the meditator. It
was doubtless to encourage those wrestling by these means with their own
inner weakness or conflicts that the following verse of the Dhammapada was
uttered:
<!--l. 44647--><p class="indent" >   Let no one neglect his own task for the sake of another&#8217;s however great; let him,
after he has discerned his own task, devote himself to his task.
<!--l. 44651--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Dhp 166
<!--l. 44653--><p class="indent" >   But if this were the whole story it would be difficult for such self-cultivation to
serve in turn as a basis for the freedom from bondage to the self-concept, which is the
main characteristic of the development of insight. Indeed, it was the recognition of
the dangers of self-preoccupation, or self-righteousness, liable to arise in
these often acute struggles for self-discipline, that impelled the more extreme
exponents of the Pure Land school of Buddhism to abandon self-cultivation in
favor of the less exacting path of reliance on the Buddha&#8217;s transforming
grace. But the cultivation of the "sublime states" represents a less radical

form of compensation which, while compatible with other practices, can
help to broaden the meditator&#8217;s perspective in order to achieve a mode of
equanimity which does not imply withdrawal into oneself or indifference to
others.
<!--l. 44667--><p class="indent" >   The starting point here, of course, is on the ethical plane in the practice of
generosity in practical ways (dana; daana) which, in order to become interiorized and
thereby go beyond mere outward form, must be grounded in an attitude of
friendliness (metta) for all beings without distinction. Since this outlook implies the
recognition that all beings are subject to joys and sorrows just as we are, it finds a
natural development in sympathy &#8212; that is to say, compassion &#8212; for their sorrows
and joy in their blessings.
<!--l. 44676--><p class="indent" >   The former of these seems much the easier to achieve, since it is possible to feel
compassion for suffering even in the absence of any positive friendliness
for the sufferer, whereas it is only possible to share genuinely in another&#8217;s
joy if there is some element of true affection or friendliness present. This is
perhaps why, on a much lower level of sensitivity, the reporting of news
seems so heavily concentrated on the side of crimes and disasters, which are
perhaps felt more likely to arouse interest than happier events and deeds. If
the latter arouse any interest at all, it is likely to be spiced with envy or
cynicism.
<!--l. 44687--><p class="indent" >   Not only does genuine joy in the prosperity of others require some element of
affection; it requires this to be of a quite high order. A great deal of what passes for
love is really aimed at mere emotional gratification on the part of the lover, for whom
the "beloved" is little more than a prop for acting out some drama satisfying a purely
subjective need &#8212; the beloved&#8217;s own needs being treated less seriously. Indeed, even
apart from outright commercialization, a certain habit of bargaining with
affections seems remarkably widespread, when one begins to take notice of
it.
<!--l. 44697--><p class="indent" >   In the light of this, the ability to feel a genuine joy in another&#8217;s happiness, equal
to one&#8217;s satisfaction with one&#8217;s own, represents a truly "sublime state." So it is not
surprising that in the history of Buddhism, which cultivated this attitude
systematically, there arose an aspiration to share with others not only one&#8217;s material
resources, but the spiritual resources described as merit. This aspiration follows
naturally enough from the basic theory as to what merit is. Merit is the accumulation
of tendencies resulting from enlightened deeds which, according to the law of
moral causation (the law of karma), conduce to the future happiness of the
doer.
<!--l. 44709--><p class="indent" >   Here he is joyful, hereafter he is joyful, in both worlds the well-doer is joyful. "I
have done good" is the thought that make him happy. Still greater is his joy when he
goes to states of bliss.
<!--l. 44714--><p class="indent" >   If the doer is still in a state where only purely personal forms of satisfaction are
possible, the fruits of merit can only take this form. But suppose he loves even one
being so much that, if that being is in some state of deprivation, he can only be made
happy by the improvement of that being&#8217;s lot, then the merit which is due to him can
only take effect by benefiting him through that other&#8217;s welfare. The wider his
altruism expands, so that purely personal gratifications no longer adequately

satisfy him, the wider must be the range of the benefit which his own merit
would need to bring to others if it is to fulfill its defined function of bringing
happiness to him. At the same time, his altruistic tendencies will ensure
that he will have vastly more merit due to him, so his resources will tend to
become commensurate with the aspirations, for example, of Santideva, when he
says:
<!--l. 44729--><p class="indent" >   May I be an alleviator of the sorrows of all beings and a divine medicine to
those afflicted by disease. May I be the benefactor and bringer of peace
to them until all their bodily ailments and mental tribulations are at the
end.
<!--l. 44734--><p class="indent" >   The principle of the sharing or transference of merit, so much stressed in
Mahayana Buddhism (though not unknown in Theravadan practices) is sometimes
objected to by Western Buddhists because of a superficial resemblance to the
Christian doctrine of atonement, which they have rejected. But the principles
entailed are not really identical, since the Christian doctrine is based on an essential
distinction between the roles of the Creator and the created, while the Buddhist
sharing of merit arises from a combination of the definition of merit and of the nature
of altruistic joy.
<!--l. 44744--><p class="indent" >   It has a further importance too, in that it anticipates the emancipation to be
derived from insight into the emptiness of the self-concept, that is to say, awakening
to the emptiness of the concepts "I" and "mine" in terms of ultimate truth. On
this level, the description "mine" as applied to merit will finally be seen
to be as inapplicable as in the case of any other assumed possession. This
was already explicitly set out in one of the Buddha&#8217;s earliest discourses,
"The Marks of the Not-self," in which he taught his first five disciples to
contemplate each of the five components of personality in the terms: "This is not
mine; this I am not; this is not my self." The fourth of these components is
the aggregate of mental tendencies or activities, which include merit and
demerit. Even on a lower plane than that of perfect insight, it can be seen
that our deeds are not exclusively ours, because no one acts in absolute
isolation, so that every act involves some stimulus or opportunity arising from
activity of others. On the other hand, a too persistent insistence on the
individual nature of merit can only impede the ultimate awakening to the
Not-self.
<!--l. 44764--><p class="indent" >   This has some bearing, too, on the reason why friendliness, compassion, and
altruistic joy are regarded as leading to an equanimity which does not imply an
indifference to the joys and sorrows of others. In the absence of such a conclusion, the
alternate sharing of joys and sorrows, like these emotions arising on one&#8217;s own
account, would be as endless as the world-cycles which it is the Buddhist aspiration
to transcend. The goal of the "divine states" is that the aspirant, who in process
achieves the role of a Bodhisattva in a two-way empathy with others by his
perfect sharing of their joys and sorrows, is in a position to radiate to them
stability, which in turn will help them to be less subject to their own emotional
vicissitudes. In this way, he and they are liberated together, each sustaining the
other.
<!--l. 44778--><p class="indent" >   The Meditative Development of Unselfish Joy

<!--l. 44780--><p class="indent" >   by Ven. Buddhaghosa (fifth-century)
<!--l. 44782--><p class="indent" >   Excerpted from The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga).
<!--l. 44784--><p class="indent" >   One who begins the development of unselfish joy should not start with dearly
beloved person, a neutral person or hostile person. For it is not the mere fact
that a person is dearly beloved, which makes him an immediate cause of
developing unselfish joy, and still less so neutral or hostile person. Persons of
the opposite sex and those who are dead are not suitable subjects for this
meditation.
<!--l. 44791--><p class="indent" >   A very close friend, however, can be a suitable subject. One who is called in the
commentaries an affectionate companion; for he is always in a joyous mood: he
laughs first and speaks afterwards. He should be the first to be pervaded with
unselfish joy. Or on seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy,
cheerful, and joyous, unselfish joy can be aroused thus: "This being, verily,
is happy! How good, how excellent!" For this is what is referred to in the
Vibhanga: "And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his
heart imbued with unselfish joy? Just as he would be joyful on seeing a dear
and beloved person, so he pervades all being with unselfish joy" (Vibhanga
274).
<!--l. 44803--><p class="indent" >   But if his affectionate friend or the dear person was happy in the past but is now
unlucky and unfortunate, then unselfish joy can still be aroused by remembering his
past happiness; or by anticipating that he will be happy and successful again in the
future.
<!--l. 44808--><p class="indent" >   Having thus aroused unselfish joy with respect to a dear person, the meditator
can then direct it towards a neutral one, and after that towards a hostile
one.
<!--l. 44812--><p class="indent" >   But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him, he should make it subside
in the same way as described under the exposition of loving-kindness.
<!--l. 44816--><p class="indent" >   He should then break down the barriers by means of impartiality towards the
four, that is, towards these three and himself. And by cultivating the sign (or
after-image, obtained in concentration), developing and repeatedly practicing it, he
should increase the absorption to triple or (according to the Abhidhamma division)
quadruple jhana.
<!--l. 44822--><p class="indent" >   Next, the versatility (in this meditation) should be understood in the same way as
stated under loving-kindness. It consists in:
<!--l. 44825--><p class="indent" >   (a) Unspecified pervasion in these five ways:"May all beings... all breathing
things... all creatures... all persons... all those who have a personality be free from
enmity, affliction, and anxiety, and live happily!"(b) Specified pervasion in these
seven ways:"May all women... all men... all Noble Ones... all not Noble Ones... all
deities... all human beings... all in states of misery (in lower worlds) be free from
enmity, etc."(c) Directional pervasion in these ten ways:"May all beings (all
breathing things, etc.; all women, etc.) in the eastern direction... in the western
direction... northern... southern direction... in the intermediate eastern, western,
northern, and southern direction... in the downward direction... in the upward
direction be free from enmity, etc."
<!--l. 44839--><p class="indent" >   This versatility is successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption
(jhana).

<!--l. 44842--><p class="indent" >   When this meditator develops the mind-deliverance of unselfish joy through any
of these kinds of absorption he obtains these eleven advantages: he sleeps in comfort,
wakes in comfort, and dreams no evil dreams, he is dear to human beings, dear to
non-human beings, deities guard him, fire and poison and weapons do not affect him,
his mind is easily concentrated, the expression of his face is serene, he dies
unconfused, if he penetrates no higher he will be reborn in the Brahma World (A v
342).
