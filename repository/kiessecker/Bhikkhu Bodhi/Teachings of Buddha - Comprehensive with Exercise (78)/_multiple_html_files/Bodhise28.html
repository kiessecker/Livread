Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya,
translated by Bhikkhu 혀namoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi (Boston: Wisdom Publications,
1995).1 The Introduction to that book contains an extraordinary synopsis of the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings in general, and of their expression in the Majjhima in
particular. A fine anthology of selected suttas is Handful of Leaves (Vol.
1), by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (distributed by the Sati Center for Buddhist
Studies).

Bhikkhu Bodhi&#8217;s summaries (in The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha) and
are used with permission. Those marked "[TB]" were provided by Thanissaro
Bhikkhu.

<!--l. 71470--><p class="indent" >   In this difficult but important sutta the Buddha reviews in depth one of the most

63} [혀namoli/Bodhi].

[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71536--><p class="indent" >   In deliciously graphic terms, the Buddha describes the allures and drawbacks of

[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71543--><p class="indent" >   What mental qualities must be abandoned in order to free oneself of greed,

Buddha lays these questions to rest.

end.

lead one to Awakening, while those connected with their opposites (renunciation, non
ill-will, and harmlessness) do.

Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71583--><p class="indent" >   Using two famous similes, the Buddha shows how the development of right

not-self.

<!--l. 71598--><p class="indent" >   Most of us spend a good part of our lives looking for happiness in all the wrong

[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71633--><p class="indent" >   In response to an insinuating remark &#8212; that his ability not to be overcome by

intense pleasures or pains &#8212; the Buddha recounts the pains he endured in his
austerities, and the pleasures that attended the path to and his attainment of
Awakening.

<!--l. 71642--><p class="indent" >   With characteristic clarity and concision the Buddha outlines the full course of
training by which a meditator may earn the right to call him- or herself a true

alertness, the four jhanas, finally culminating in the realization of the insight
knowledges.

<!--l. 71690--><p class="indent" >   MN 53: Sekha-patipada Sutta &#8212; The Practice for One in Training {M i 353}
[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71693--><p class="indent" >   "Consummate in clear-knowing and conduct" is a standard epithet for the
Buddha. This sutta explains what it means, and shows that it can be used to

describe an arahant as well. [TB]
<!--l. 71698--><p class="indent" >   MN 54: Potaliya Sutta &#8212; To Potaliya (excerpt) {M i 359} [Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71701--><p class="indent" >   Using seven graphic similes for the drawbacks of sensual passions, the Buddha

have entirely cut off one&#8217;s worldly affairs. [TB]

[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71715--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha explains the criteria for determining whether or not something is
worth saying. This discourse is a beautiful example of the Buddha&#8217;s skill as teacher:

action.

conviction a prerequisite for listening to the Buddha&#8217;s teachings with respect,

[Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71793--><p class="indent" >   The highest attainment is not simply the abandoning of unskillful actions and a

among his disciples in ordaining on the power of pure conviction. In the
first part of the story, Ratthapala deals with his parents&#8217; opposition to his
ordaining, and their attempts, after ordination, to lure him back to lay life.
In the second part, he recalls the four observations about the world that
inspired him, as a healthy and wealthy young man, to ordain in the first
place.

<!--l. 71818--><p class="indent" >   King Pasenadi of Kosala figures prominently in many discourses as a devout

<!--l. 71826--><p class="indent" >   A case study in how social advantages can be a spiritual liability. The discussion
focuses on the factors needed for release &#8212; attainable by all people, regardless of
caste or race &#8212; while the gently satirical frame story shows how the life of a king, or
any highly placed person, presents obstacles to developing those factors.

Sariputta, this discourse teaches two lessons in heedfulness. (1) If you&#8217;re engaging in
wrong livelihood, don&#8217;t expect to escape the karmic consequences even if you&#8217;re doing
it to fulfil your duties to your family, parents, or friends. (2) Don&#8217;t be satisfied with
mundane levels of attainment in meditation when there is still more to be done.

<!--l. 71851--><p class="indent" >   MN 101: Devadaha Sutta &#8212; To Devadaha {M ii 214} [Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71853--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha refutes a Jain theory of kamma, which claims that one&#8217;s present
experience is determined solely by one&#8217;s actions in past lives, and that the only
way to undo the effects of past unskillful actions is to "burn them away"
through severe practices of austerity. The Buddha here outlines one of his most
important teachings on kamma: that it is both the results of past deeds and
present actions that shape one&#8217;s experience of the present. It is precisely
this interaction of present and past that opens up the very possibility of
Awakening.
<!--l. 71863--><p class="indent" >   MN 105: Sunakkhatta Sutta &#8212; To Sunakkhatta {M ii 252} [Thanissaro].
<!--l. 71866--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha addresses the problem of meditators who overestimate their progress
in meditation. The sutta ends with a warning: anyone who claims enlightenment as
license for unrestrained behavior is like someone who fails to follow the doctor&#8217;s
orders after surgery, who knowingly drinks a cup of poison, or who deliberately
extends a hand toward a deadly snake. [TB]
