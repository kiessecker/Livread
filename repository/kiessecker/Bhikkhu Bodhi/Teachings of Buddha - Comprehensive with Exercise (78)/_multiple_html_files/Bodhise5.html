<!--l. 39735--><p class="indent" >   by Bhikkhu Bodhi
<!--l. 39737--><p class="indent" >   The practice of giving is universally recognized as one of the most basic human
virtues, a quality that testifies to the depth of one&#8217;s humanity and one&#8217;s capacity for
self-transcendence. In the teaching of the Buddha, too, the practice of giving claims a
place of special eminence, one which singles it out as being in a sense the foundation
and seed of spiritual development. In the Pali suttas we read time and again that
"talk on giving" (danakatha) was invariably the first topic to be discussed
by the Buddha in his "graduated exposition" of the Dhamma. Whenever
the Buddha delivered a discourse to an audience of people who had not
yet come to regard him as their teacher, he would start by emphasizing
the value of giving. Only after his audience had come to appreciate this
virtue would he introduce other aspects of his teaching, such as morality, the
law of kamma, and the benefits in renunciation, and only after all these
principles had made their impact on the minds of his listeners would he
expound to them that unique discovery of the Awakened Ones, the Four Noble
Truths.
<!--l. 39755--><p class="indent" >   Strictly speaking, giving does not appear in its own right among the factors of the
Noble Eightfold Path, nor does it enter among the other requisites of enlightenment
(bodhipakkhiya dhamma). Most probably it has been excluded from these groupings
because the practice of giving does not by its own nature conduce directly and
immediately to the arising of insight and the realization of the Four Noble
Truths. Giving functions in the Buddhist discipline in a different capacity.
It does not come at the apex of the path, as a factor constituent of the
process of awakening, but rather it serves as a basis and preparation which

underlies and quietly supports the entire endeavor to free the mind from the
defilements.
<!--l. 39767--><p class="indent" >   Nevertheless, though giving is not counted directly among the factors of the path,
its contribution to progress along the road to liberation should not be overlooked or
underestimated. The prominence of this contribution is underscored by the place
which the Buddha assigns to giving in various sets of practices he has laid down for
his followers. Besides appearing as the first topic in the graduated exposition of
the Dhamma, the practice of giving also figures as the first of the three
bases of meritorious deeds (punnakiriyavatthu), as the first of the four means
of benefiting others (sangahavatthu), and as the first of the ten paramis
or "perfections." The latter are the sublime virtues to be cultivated by all
aspirants to enlightenment, and to the most exalted degree by those who follow
the way of the Bodhisatta aimed at the supreme enlightenment of perfect
Buddhahood.
<!--l. 39782--><p class="indent" >   Regarded from another angle, giving can also be identified with the personal
quality of generosity (caga). This angle highlights the practice of giving, not as the
outwardly manifest act by which an object is transferred from oneself to others, but
as the inward disposition to give, a disposition which is strengthened by outward acts
of giving and which in turn makes possible still more demanding acts of
self-sacrifice. Generosity is included among the essential attributes of the
sappurisa, the good or superior person, along with such other qualities as
faith, morality, learning and wisdom. Viewed as the quality of generosity,
giving has a particularly intimate connection to the entire movement of the
Buddha&#8217;s path. For the goal of the path is the destruction of greed, hate and
delusion, and the cultivation of generosity directly debilitates greed and hate,
while facilitating that pliancy of mind that allows for the eradication of
delusion.
<!--l. 39797--><p class="indent" >   The present Wheel publication has been compiled in order to explore in greater
depth this cardinal Buddhist virtue, the practice of giving, which in writings on
applied Buddhism is so often taken for granted that it is usually passed
over without comment. In this issue four practicing Buddhists of today,
all of whom combine textual knowledge of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings with a
personal commitment to the path, set forth their understanding of the various
aspects of giving and examine it in relation to the wider body of Dhamma
practice.
<!--l. 39806--><p class="indent" >   The collection concludes with a translation of an older document &#8212; the
description of the Bodhisatta&#8217;s practice of giving by the medieval commentator,
Acariya Dhammapala. This has been extracted from his Treatise on the Paramis,
found in his commentary to the Cariyapitaka.
<!--l. 39811--><p class="indent" >   The Practice of Giving
<!--l. 39813--><p class="indent" >   by Susan Elbaum Jootla
<!--l. 39815--><p class="indent" >   The inspiration and basic material for this essay come from The Perfection of
Generosity (Dana Parami), by Saya U Chit Tin, published as No. 3 in the Dhamma
Series of the Sayagyi U Ba Khin Memorial Trust, U.K., Splatts House, Heddington
near Calne, Wiltshire, England. I am deeply grateful to Saya U Chit Tin and to all
the other teachers associated with the International Meditation Centres at

Heddington, U.K. and Rangoon, Burma.
<!--l. 39823--><p class="indent" >   Giving (dana) is one of the essential preliminary steps of Buddhist practice. When
practiced in itself, it is a basis of merit or wholesome kamma. When coupled with
morality, concentration and insight, it leads ultimately to liberation from samsara,
the cycle of repeated existence. Even those who are well-established on the path to
emancipation continue to practice giving as it is conducive to wealth, beauty and
pleasure in their remaining lifetimes. Bodhisattas complete the danaparami or
perfection of giving to the ultimate degree by happily donating their limbs and their
very lives to help other beings.
<!--l. 39833--><p class="indent" >   Like all good deeds, an act of giving will bring us happiness in the future, in
accordance with the kammic law of cause and effect taught by the Buddha. Giving
yields benefits in the present life and in lives to come whether or not we are aware of
this fact, but when the volition is accompanied by understanding, we can greatly
increase the merits earned by our gifts.
<!--l. 39840--><p class="indent" >   The amount of merit gained varies according to three factors: the quality of the
donor&#8217;s motive, the spiritual purity of the recipient, and the kind and size of the gift.
Since we have to experience the results of our actions, and good deeds lead to
good results and bad deeds to bad results, it is sensible to try to create as
much good kamma as possible. In the practice of giving, this would mean
keeping one&#8217;s mind pure in the act of giving, selecting the worthiest recipients
available, and choosing the most appropriate and generous gifts one can
afford.
<!--l. 39850--><p class="indent" >   The Factor of Volition
<!--l. 39852--><p class="indent" >   The volition of the donor before, during and after the act of generosity is the most
important of the three factors involved in the practice of giving: "If we have no
control over our minds we will not choose proper gifts, the best recipient..., we will be
unable to prepare them properly. And we may be foolish enough to regret having
made them afterwards."1 Buddhist teaching devotes special attention to the
psychological basis of giving, distinguishing among the different states of mind with
which one may give. A fundamental distinction is made between acts of giving that
lack wisdom and those that are accompanied by wisdom, the latter being superior to
the former. An example of a very elementary kind of giving would be the case of a
young girl who places a flower on the household shrine simply because her
mother tells her to do so, without having any idea of the significance of her
act.
<!--l. 39867--><p class="indent" >   Generosity associated with wisdom before, during and after the act is the
highest type of giving. Three examples of wise giving are: giving with the clear
understanding that according to the kammic law of cause and effect, the generous act
will bring beneficial results in the future; giving while aware that the gift,
the recipient and the giver are all impermanent; and giving with the aim
of enhancing one&#8217;s efforts to become enlightened. As the giving of a gift
takes a certain amount of time, a single act of giving may be accompanied
by each of these three types of understanding at a different stage in the
process.
<!--l. 39878--><p class="indent" >   The most excellent motive for giving is the intention that it strengthens ones
efforts to attain Nibbana. Liberation is achieved by eliminating all the mental

defilements (kilesa), which are rooted in the delusion of a controlling and lasting "I."
Once this illusion is eradicated, selfish thoughts can no longer arise. If we aspire to
ultimate peace and purity by practicing generosity, we will be developing the dana
parami, the perfection of giving, building up a store of merit that will bear its full
fruit with our attainment of enlightenment. As we progress towards that goal, the
volition involved in acts of giving will assist us by contributing towards the pliancy of
the mind, an essential asset in developing concentration and wisdom, the prime
requisites of liberation.
<!--l. 39891--><p class="indent" >   Ariyas &#8212; noble ones, those who have attained any of the four stages of
holiness &#8212; always give with pure volition because their minds function on
the basis of wisdom. Those below this level sometimes give carelessly or
disrespectfully, with unwholesome states of mind. The Buddha teaches that in
the practice of giving, as in all bodily and verbal conduct, it is the volition
accompanying the act that determines its moral quality. If one is offering something
to a monk, doing so without adopting a respectful manner would not be
proper. Throwing a coin to a beggar in order to get rid of him would also
be considered a defilement of giving. One should think carefully about the
relevance and the timing of a gift for it to bring the best results. A gift given
through an intermediary &#8212; for example, having a servant give food to a
monk rather than giving it by one&#8217;s own hand &#8212; also detracts from the
value of the gift. When one gives without realizing that one must experience
the results of one&#8217;s deeds, an act of giving again diminishes in meritorious
potency.
<!--l. 39909--><p class="indent" >   If one only plans on giving a donation but does not fulfill one&#8217;s plan, the merit
earned will be very slight. Thus we should always follow up our intentions of
generosity expeditiously, unless something intervenes to prevent our doing so. If, after
having given a gift, we should subsequently regret our action, much of the merit of
the deed will be lost.
<!--l. 39916--><p class="indent" >   A moral person gives politely and respectfully. Whether the gift is spontaneous or
planned, he or she will make sure that the timing and contents of the gift are
appropriate for the receiver. Many housewives in Buddhist countries regularly invite
a few monks to their homes to receive almsfood early in the day. Before feeding the
family, these women always offer the food to the bhikkhus with their own
hands.
<!--l. 39923--><p class="indent" >   One might contribute to a certain cause from fear that friends would disapprove if
one did not give. Giving in response to such social pressures will have weak, though
still beneficial, results. Charitable actions undertaken to gain a good reputation
are also selfish and hence not a very valuable kind of giving. Nor can it be
praiseworthy when one gives merely to return a favor or in expectation of a
reward. The former is like repaying a debt, the latter analogous to offering a
bribe.
<!--l. 39932--><p class="indent" >   The Recipient of Gifts
<!--l. 39934--><p class="indent" >   The purity of the recipient is another factor which helps determine the kammic
fruitfulness of a gift. The worthier the receiver, the greater the benefits that will
come to the donor; hence it is good to give to the holiest people available. The
Buddha teaches that the worthiest recipients of gifts are the ariyas, the noble ones,

such as the Buddha himself and those of his disciples who have reached
supramundane paths and fruits; for it is their purity of mind, attained by wisdom,
that makes the act of giving capable of yielding abundant benefits. Therefore, to earn
the maximum merit, we should give as much as we can, and as often as possible, to
the noble ones. Gifts to a bhikkhu who strives for the state of a noble one, or to a
Buddhist meditator who lives by the Five Precepts, will also yield bountiful
results.
<!--l. 39948--><p class="indent" >   When ariyas accept offerings, they do so to provide an opportunity for the donor
to earn merit. Non-returners and Arahats in particular, who have attained the two
highest stages of sanctity, have eliminated desire for sense objects. Thus when they
are given gifts their minds remain detached from the objects presented and are filled
with compassion for the giver.
<!--l. 39955--><p class="indent" >   The story of Sivali in the Dhammapada Commentary2 is an example of the great
merit which even a small gift can yield when presented to the Sangha led by the
Buddha. At the time of Vipassi Buddha, the citizens of a country were competing
with their king to see who could make the greatest offering to the Buddha and
Sangha. The citizens had obtained everything for their offering except fresh honey,
and they sent out messengers, each with plenty of money, to buy the missing
ingredient.
<!--l. 39963--><p class="indent" >   One of these men met a villager who happened to be bringing a newly harvested
honeycomb into the city for sale. The messenger was only able to buy it from the
peasant when he had offered his entire allowance of a thousand pieces of money,
which was far more than a single honeycomb was worth. The villager said:
"Are you crazy?... This honey isn&#8217;t worth a farthing but you offer me a
thousand pieces of money for it. What is the explanation for this?" The other
man told him that the honey was worth so much to him because it was
the final item on the menu for the citizens&#8217; offering to the Buddha. The
peasant spontaneously replied, "If that is the case, I will not sell it to you for a
price; if I may receive the merit of the offering, I will give it to you." The
citizens were impressed with the faith of this man who so readily gave up a
windfall and enthusiastically agreed that he should receive the merit of the
offering.
<!--l. 39979--><p class="indent" >   Because of this simple gift at the time of the Vipassi Buddha, the villager was
reborn numerous times in celestial planes and the became the prince who inherited
the throne of Benares. In his final lifetime, he became the Elder Sivali and attained
Arahatship as a disciple of the present Buddha. Even after that, his gift of the
honeycomb continued to bear fruit. To honor the one who had made the sweet gift
aeons before, the gods provided lodging and food for the Buddha and five hundred of
his monks, including Sivali, when for several days they had been walking along a
deserted road.
<!--l. 39989--><p class="indent" >   The practice of giving is also beneficial when directed to someone who is not
spiritually advanced. If the donor&#8217;s intention is good, then even though the receiver
is immoral, the donor will earn merit and further, by his act of giving, he
will strengthen within himself his own disposition to renunciation. A gift
mentally offered to the noble Sangha but physically presented to a monk
who is morally corrupt will still bear great fruit. To be sure, we should not

pretend that a bad person is good, but we must be most careful of our own
attitude while giving, as our attitude is the factor over which we have most
control.
<!--l. 40000--><p class="indent" >   The Objects to be Given
<!--l. 40002--><p class="indent" >   The third factor involved in giving is the gift itself, which can be either material
or immaterial. Dhamma-dana, the gift of the noble teachings, is said by the
Buddha to excel all other gifts (Dhammapada, 354). Those who expound
his teachings &#8212; monks who preach sermons or recite from the Tipitaka,
teachers of meditation &#8212; frequently share the Truth, thus practicing the
highest kind of generosity. Those of us who are not qualified to teach the
Dhamma can give the gift of the Dhamma in other ways. We can donate
Dhamma books or pay for the translation or publication of a rare or new
manuscript propagating the Buddha-Word. We can discuss the Dhamma
informally and encourage others to keep precepts or to take up meditation. We
might write an explanation of some aspect of the Dhamma for the benefit of
others. Giving cash or labor to a meditation center or helping support a
meditation teacher can also be considered the gift of the Dhamma, as the
purpose of the center and the teacher is the transmission of the Buddha&#8217;s
teaching.
<!--l. 40019--><p class="indent" >   The most common type of gift is material things. A material object need
not have a high monetary value for it to bring great results, as the story of
Sivali and the honeycomb illustrates. If a poor man gives a monk the cup of
rice that was to be his only food for the day, the man is making a great
donation which may bear abundant fruit, while if a prosperous merchant,
knowing in advance that the monk was coming for alms, were to give the same
small portion of rice, he would reap meager fruits. We should try to give
things whose quality is at least as good as those we use ourselves, like the
people of Burma, who buy the best fruits on the market as gifts for the
monks although these fruits are much too expensive for them to consume
themselves.
<!--l. 40031--><p class="indent" >   Gifts to the Sangha may consist of food, robes, medicine or monasteries, each of
which has a wide range. The limits are set by the rules of the Vinaya to keep the
Bhikkhu Sangha pure and strong. Lay people who understand the monks&#8217; rules can
earn vast merit by donating the proper things at the proper time to the order of
monks and nuns.
<!--l. 40037--><p class="indent" >   A story about Visakha, the Buddha&#8217;s chief woman lay disciple, offers a delightful
illustration of the results of large-scale charity.3 When Visakha was to be married,
elaborate preparations and gifts were arranged by her father. He gave her five
hundred cartloads each of money, of gold, silver and copper implements.
Then he decided that she must also take cattle with her. He gave orders
to his men to allow out of their pen just as many animals as would fill a
particular lane. When the cows has filed out and stood close together in
that road, he had the corral closed, saying, "These cattle are enough for my
daughter." However, after the gate had been latched securely, powerful bulls and
milk cows jumped over the barrier to join the animals going with Visakha.
Her father&#8217;s servants could not keep them inside no matter how hard they

tried.
<!--l. 40051--><p class="indent" >   All these cattle came to Visakha because, in a former lifetime long ago
at the time of the Buddha Kassapa, she had given a generous gift of five
kinds of dairy products to a company of 20,000 monks and novices. As the
youngest of the seven daughters of King Kiki of Benares, she continued to
urge the monks to take more milk, curds, ghee, etc., even when they said
they had eaten enough. That gift earned her the merit of having such a
large number of cattle go along with her at her marriage in the lifetime
when she was Visakha, and no one could prevent this merit from bearing its
fruit.
<!--l. 40061--><p class="indent" >   Material gifts of a religious nature would include contributions towards the
erection of a new temple or shrine, gold leaf to help gild the umbrella of a shrine, or
the purchase of a Buddha statue for a temple. The recipients of such gifts are the
general public &#8212; whoever comes to the temple or worships before the Buddha
image.
<!--l. 40067--><p class="indent" >   Mundane gifts to the citizens of one&#8217;s town would include donations to various
welfare organizations, a contribution to a hospital or public library, keeping a
neighborhood park neat and clean. If one does not merely contribute funds for such
projects but provides physical labor as well, the kammic results will be even greater.
Gifts of this sort can be quite meritorious if preceded, accompanied and followed by
pure mental volitions.
<!--l. 40075--><p class="indent" >   The Perfection of Giving
<!--l. 40077--><p class="indent" >   There is a mode of giving which completely disregards the qualities of the
recipient and even the mundane fruits of the merit acquired by giving. Such
generosity springs from the motive of renunciation, the thought of eliminating one&#8217;s
attachment to one&#8217;s possessions, and thus aims at giving away the dearest and most
difficult gifts. Bodhisattas give in this manner whenever the opportunity presents
itself, strictly in order to fulfill the danaparami, the "perfection of giving," which is
the first of the ten perfections they must cultivate to the highest degree in order to
attain Buddhahood. A Bodhisatta&#8217;s work to complete the perfection of giving
demands much more of him than other beings could emulate. Many Jataka tales
relate how the Bodhisatta who was to become the Buddha Gotama gave things away
with absolutely no thought of himself or of the mundane benefits that might follow.
A Bodhisatta&#8217;s only concern in practicing generosity is to fulfill the requirements for
Buddhahood.
<!--l. 40093--><p class="indent" >   The Basket of Conduct4 contains ten stories of the Bodhisatta&#8217;s former
lives. In one of these lifetimes he was a brahman named Sankha who saw a
Paccekabuddha, or non-teaching enlightened one, walking barefoot on a desert path.
Sankha thought to himself, "Desiring merit, seeing one eminently worthy of
a gift of faith, if I do not give him a gift, I will dwindle in merit." So the
brahman, who had a very delicate constitution, presented his sandals to the
Paccekabuddha even though his own need for them was greater (Division I, Story
2).
<!--l. 40103--><p class="indent" >   Another time the Bodhisatta was a great emperor named Maha-Sudassana. He
had criers proclaim several times every day, in thousands of places throughout his
empire, that anyone who wanted anything would be given it if he just came

there and asked. "If there came a mendicant beggar, whether by day or by
night, receiving whatever goods he wanted, he went away with hands full."
Maha-Sudassana gave with completely openhanded generosity, "without
attachment, expecting nothing in return, for the attainment of Self-Awakening"
(I,4).
<!--l. 40113--><p class="indent" >   A Bodhisatta must give more difficult gifts than material goods to fulfill the
highest form of the perfection of generosity. He must freely give the parts of his body,
his children, his wife, and even his own life. As King Sivi, our Bodhisatta plucked out
both his eyes with his bare hands and gave them to Sakka, the king of the gods.
Sakka had come to Sivi in the guise of a blind old man, just to provide him with the
opportunity to make this remarkable gift. Sivi did this with no hesitation prior to the
act, nor with any reluctance during the act, nor with any hint of regret afterwards.
He said that this gift was made "for the sake of Awakening itself. The two eyes were
not disagreeable to me. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave my eyes"
(I,8).
<!--l. 40126--><p class="indent" >   As Prince Vessantara, the Bodhisatta gave the auspicious, powerful royal elephant
to the people of a rival kingdom merely because they had requested it. As a result of
this liberality, he and his wife and two small children were banished to a
remote mountain. They lived there in the forest, Vessantara tending his son
and daughter in their hut while his wife spent the days gathering the wild
fruits on which they lived. One day a traveler chanced by and asked the
Bodhisatta to give him the children. Vessantara gave them away without any
hesitation at all. Later he gave away his virtuous wife too. "Neither child was
disagreeable to me, the Lady Maddi was not disagreeable. Omniscience was dear to
me, therefore I gave away those who were dear" (I, 9). It should be noted
that at that time, a man&#8217;s children and wife were generally considered his
property. Ages before, the Lady Maddi had aspired to be the wife of the
Bodhisatta and to share whatever trials he had to undergo along the path to
Buddhahood. The result of her own kamma complemented Prince Vessanatara&#8217;s
volition and led to her being given away. Their children must also have been
experiencing the results of their own past deeds when they had to leave their
parents.
<!--l. 40145--><p class="indent" >   Another time the Bodhisatta took birth as a wise hare. That existence came to an
end when, joyously, he jumped into a fire after inviting a famished brahman (again,
Sakka in disguise) to eat him roasted. Because of the purity of the Bodhisatta&#8217;s
mind while making this highest gift of his entire body and life, the blazing
fire did not hurt him as it burned his flesh. In relating the story he said
that, in fact, the fire had calmed him and brought him peace as if it had
been cool water, because he had accomplished the complete perfection of
giving.
<!--l. 40154--><p class="indent" >   The Ultimate Goal of Giving
<!--l. 40156--><p class="indent" >   The goal of the Buddhist path is emancipation from the suffering of
repeated existence in samsara. The Buddha taught that uprooting ignorance
and the mental defilements it nurtures will bring us to Nibbana, the utter
cessation of suffering. Unwholesome mental tendencies make us cling to what we
mistakenly take to be our "selves," they keep us struggling to satisfy our

insatiable sense desires with objects that are inherently transitory and thus
unsatisfying.
<!--l. 40164--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha said that the practice of giving will aid us in our efforts to purify the
mind. Generous gifts accompanied by wholesome volition help to eradicate suffering
in three ways. First, when we decide to give something of our own to someone else,
we simultaneously reduce our attachment to the object; to make a habit of giving can
thus gradually weaken the mental factor of craving, one of the main causes of
unhappiness. Second, giving accompanied by wholesome volition will lead to happy
future births in circumstances favorable to encountering and practicing the pure
Buddha Dhamma. Third, and most important, when giving is practiced with the
intention that the mind becomes pliant enough for the attainment of Nibbana,
the act of generosity will help us develop virtue, concentration and wisdom
(sila,samadhi,pañña) right in the present. These three stages make up the Buddha&#8217;s
Noble Eightfold Path, and perfecting the path leads to the extinction of
suffering.
<!--l. 40179--><p class="indent" >   If we give in the hope of winning luxury in future lives, we may attain
our aim providing that we adhere to the principles of virtuous conduct.
According to the Buddha, however, the motivation of working for liberation
is far superior to that of aiming at mundane happiness in future births.
This is because a gift made with the desire for pleasure is accompanied in
part by the unwholesome psychological root craving (tanha). The merits
earned by such gifts are exhausted in transient pleasure, and such mundane
happiness keeps us revolving in the round of rebirth, which in the deepest
sense is always dukkha, subject to suffering. Giving associated with craving
cannot contribute to the one form of happiness that does not perish, release
from the round, which comes only with the full elimination of craving. Gifts
untainted by craving and attachment can only be made during a Buddha
Sasana, the period when the teachings of a Buddha are available. So when
we give now, during such a time, we should do so with the aim of putting
an end to craving. With the end of craving, suffering ceases, and that is
liberation.
<!--l. 40197--><p class="indent" >   May the merits of this gift of the Dhamma be shared by all beings!
<!--l. 40199--><p class="indent" >   Giving in the Pali Canon
<!--l. 40201--><p class="indent" >   by Lily de Silva
<!--l. 40203--><p class="indent" >   Dana, giving, is extolled in the Pali canon as a great virtue. It is, in fact, the
beginning of the path to liberation. When the Buddha preaches to a newcomer he
starts his graduated sermon with an exposition on the virtues of giving (danakatha,
Vin.i,15,18). Of the three bases for the performance of meritorious deeds
(punnakiriyavatthu), giving is the first, the other two being virtue and mental culture
(A.iv,241). It is also the first of the ten paramita perfected by a Buddha. Therefore,
on the march towards liberation as an arahant or a Buddha, one initially has to
practice dana.
<!--l. 40213--><p class="indent" >   Function of Giving
<!--l. 40215--><p class="indent" >   Giving is of prime importance in the Buddhist scheme of mental purification
because it is the best weapon against greed (lobha), the first of the three
unwholesome motivational roots (akusalamula). Greed is wrapt up with

egoism and selfishness, since we hold our personalities and our possessions as
"I" and "mine". Giving helps make egoism thaw: it is the antidote to cure
the illness of egoism and greed. "Overcome the taint of greed and practice
giving," exhorts the Devatasamyutta (S.i,18). The Dhammapada admonishes
us to conquer miserliness with generosity (jine kadariyam danena, Dhp.
223).
<!--l. 40226--><p class="indent" >   It is difficult to exercise this virtue of giving proportionate to the intensity of
one&#8217;s greed and selfishness. As such the Devatasamyutta equates giving
to a battle (danan ca yuddhan ca samanam ahu, S.i,20). One has to fight
the evil forces of greed before one can make up one&#8217;s mind to give away
something dear and useful to oneself. The Latukikopama Sutta illustrates
how a man lacking in spiritual strength finds it hard to give up a thing he
has been used to (M.i, 449). A small quail can come to death when it gets
entangled even in a useless rotten creeper. Though weak, a rotten creeper is a
great bond for the small bird. But even an iron chain is not too big a bond
for a strong elephant. Similarly, a poor wretched man of weak character
would find it difficult to part with his shabby meager belongings, while a
strong-charactered king will even give up a kingdom once convinced of the dangers of
greed.
<!--l. 40241--><p class="indent" >   Miserliness is not the only hindrance to giving. Carelessness and ignorance of the
working of kamma and survival after death are equally valid causes (macchera ca
pamada ca evam danam na diyati, S.i,18). If one knows the moral advantages of
giving, one will be vigilant to seize opportunities to practice this great virtue. Once
the Buddha said that if people only knew the value of giving as he does,
they would not take a single meal without sharing their food with others
(It.p,18).
<!--l. 40250--><p class="indent" >   Qualities of the Donor
<!--l. 40252--><p class="indent" >   The suttas (e.g., D.i,137) employ a number of terms to describe the qualities of a
donor. He is a man with faith (saddha), he has faith in the nobility of a morally
sound life, in the teachings of kamma and survival after death. He believes in the
possibility of the moral and spiritual perfection of man. In short, he is not a
materialist, and he has faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. He is not
merely a giver (dayako), he is a lordly giver (danapati). The commentary explains the
concept of "lordly giver" in the following words: "He who himself enjoys delicious
things but gives to others what is not delicious is a donor who is a slave to the gifts
he gives. He who gives things of the same quality as he himself enjoys is one who is
like a friend of the gift. He who satisfies himself with whatever he can get but
gives delicacies to others is a lordly giver, a senior and a master of the gifts
given."
<!--l. 40267--><p class="indent" >   The donor is also described as one who keeps an open house for the needy
(anavatadvaro). He is like a wellspring (opanabhuto) for recluses, brahmans, the
destitute, wayfarers, wanderers and beggars. Being such a one he does meritorious
deeds. He is munificent (muttacago) and is interested in sharing his blessings with
others (danasamvibhagarato). He is a philanthropist who understands the difficulties
of the poor (vadannu). He is open-handed and is ready to comply with another&#8217;s
request (payatapani). He is one fit to be asked from (yacayogo). He takes delight in

distributing gifts to the needy (vossaggarato), and has a heart bent on giving
(cagaparibhavitacitto). Such are the epithets used in the suttas to describe the
qualities of the liberal-minded.
<!--l. 40279--><p class="indent" >   A noble giver is one who is happy before, during and after giving (A.iii,336).
Before giving he is happy anticipating the opportunity to exercise his generosity.
While giving he is happy that he is making another happy by fulfilling a need. After
giving he is satisfied that he has done a good deed. The suttas list generosity as one
of the important qualities that go to make a gentleman (A.iv,220). The Buddha
compares the man who righteously earns his wealth and gives of it to the needy to a
man who has both eyes, whereas the one who only earns wealth but does no
merit is like a one-eyed man (A.i,129-30). The wealthy man who enjoys his
riches by himself without sharing is said to be digging his own grave (Sn.
102).
<!--l. 40291--><p class="indent" >   The Donations
<!--l. 40293--><p class="indent" >   Practically anything useful can be given as a gift. The Niddesa (ND.2, 523) gives
a list of fourteen items that are fit to be given for charity. They are robes, almsfood,
dwelling places, medicine and other requisites for the sick, food, drink, cloths,
vehicles, garlands, perfume, unguent, beds, houses and lamps. It is not necessary to
have much to practice generosity, for one can give according to one&#8217;s means. Gifts
given from one&#8217;s meager resources are considered very valuable (appasma dakkhina
dinna sahassena samam mita, S.i,18; dajjappasmim pi yacito, Dhp. 224). If a
person leads a righteous life even though he ekes out a bare existence on
gleanings, looks after his family according to his means, but makes it a point to
give from his limited stores, his generosity is worth more than a thousand
sacrifices (S.i, 19-20). Alms given from wealth righteously earned is greatly
praised by the Buddha (A.iii,354; It.p.66; A.iii,45-46). A householder who does
so is said to be one who is lucky here and hereafter. In the Magha Sutta
of the Sutta Nipata (Sn.p.87) the Buddha highly appreciates Magha who
says that he earns through righteous means and liberally gives of it to the
needy.
<!--l. 40312--><p class="indent" >   Even if one gives a small amount with a heart full of faith one can gain happiness
hereafter. The Vimanavattha supplies ample examples. According to the
Acamadayikavimanavatthu, the alms given consisted of a little rice crust, but as it
was given with great devotion to an eminent arahant, the reward was rebirth in a
magnificent celestial mansion. The Dakkhainavibhanga Sutta states that an
offering is purified on account of the giver when the giver is virtuous, on
account of the recipient when the recipient is virtuous, on account of both the
giver and the recipient if both are virtuous, by none if both happen to be
impious. Dhammadana, the dissemination of the knowledge of the Dhamma, is
said to excel all other forms of giving (sabbadanam dhammadanam jinati,
Dhp.354).
<!--l. 40325--><p class="indent" >   The Anguttara Nikaya mentions five great gifts which have been held in high
esteem by noble-minded men from ancient times (A.iv,246). Their value was not
doubted in ancient times, it is not doubted at present, nor will it be doubted in the
future. The wise recluses and brahmans had the highest respect for them. These
great givings comprise the meticulous observance of the Five Precepts. By doing so

one gives fearlessness, love and benevolence to all beings. If one human being can
give security and freedom from fear to others by his behavior, that is the
highest form of dana one can give, not only to mankind, but to all living
beings.
<!--l. 40336--><p class="indent" >   The Donee
<!--l. 40338--><p class="indent" >   The suttas also describe the person to whom alms should be given (A.iii, 41).
Guests, travelers and the sick should be treated with hospitality and due
consideration. During famines the needy should be liberally entertained. The virtuous
should be first entertained with the first fruits of fresh crops. There is a
recurrent phrase in the suttas (D.i, 137; ii,354; iii,76) describing those who
are particularly in need of public generosity. They are recluses (samana),
brahmans (brahmana), destitutes (kapana), wayfarers (addhika), wanderers
(vanibbaka) and beggars (yacaka). The recluses and brahmans are religious persons
who do not earn wages. They give spiritual guidance to the laity and the
laity is expected to support them. The poor need the help of the rich to
survive and the rich become spiritually richer by helping the poor. At a time
when transport facilities were meager and amenities for travelers were not
adequately organized, the public had to step in to help the wayfarer. Buddhism
considers it a person&#8217;s moral obligation to give assistance to all these types of
people.
<!--l. 40355--><p class="indent" >   In the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha describes, with sacrificial terminology, three
types of fires that should be tended with care and honor (A.iv,44). They are
ahuneyyaggi,gahapataggi and dakkhineyyaggi. The Buddha explained that
ahuneyyaggi means one&#8217;s parents, and they should be honored and cared for.
Gahapataggi means one&#8217;s wife and children, employees and dependents.
Dakkineyyaggi represents religious persons who have either attained the goal of
arahantship or have embarked on a course of training for the elimination of negative
mental traits. All these should be cared for and looked after as one would tend a
sacrificial fire. According to the Maha-mangala Sutta, offering hospitality to one&#8217;s
relatives is one of the great auspicious deeds a layperson can perform (Sn.
262-63).
<!--l. 40368--><p class="indent" >   King Kosala once asked the Buddha to whom alms should be given (S.i,98). The
Buddha replied that alms should be given to those by giving to whom one becomes
happy. Then the king asked another question: To whom should alms be offered to
obtain great fruit? The Buddha discriminated the two as different questions and
replied that alms offered to the virtuous bears great fruit. He further clarified
that offerings yield great fruit when made to virtuous recluses who have
eliminated the five mental hindrances (nivarana) and culivated moral habits,
concentration, wisdom, emancipation and knowledge and vision of emancipation
(sila,samadhi,pañña,vimutti,vimuttinanadassana).
<!--l. 40378--><p class="indent" >   In the Sakkasamyutta (S.i,233) Sakka asked the same question from the Buddha:
Gifts given to whom bring the greatest result? The Buddha replied that what is given
to the Sangha bears great results. Here the Buddha specifies that what he
means by "Sangha" is the community of those upright noble individuals who
have entered the path and who have established themselves in the fruit of
saintship, and who are endowed with morality, concentration and wisdom. It is

important to note that "Sangha" according to the Vinaya means a sufficient
group of monks to represent the Order of monks for various ecclesiastical
purposes (Vin. i,319). But in the suttas "Sangha" means the four pairs of noble
individuals or the eight particular individuals (cattari purisayugani,attha
purisapuggala), i.e., those who are on the path to stream-entry, once-returning,
non-returning, and arahantship, and those who have obtained the fruits
thereof.
<!--l. 40394--><p class="indent" >   The Magha Sutta (Sn.p.86) gives a detailed account of the virtues of the
arahant to show to whom alms should be offered by one desiring merit. The
Brahmanasamyutta (S.i,175) maintains that offerings bear greatest results when they
are made to those who know their previous lives, who have seen heavens and hells,
who have put an end to birth and who have realized ultimate knowledge. Thus the
Sangha comprising morally perfect, worthy personages as described in the suttas
constitutes the field of merit (punnakkhetta, M.i,447). Just as seeds sown in
fertile well-watered fields yields bountiful crops, alms given to the virtuous
established on the Noble Eightfold Path yield great results (A.iv,238; i,162). The
Dhammapada maintains that fields have weeds as their blemish; lust, hatred,
delusion and desire are the blemishes of people and therefore what is given to
those who have eliminated those blemishes bears great fruit (Dhp. 356-59).
The results of generosity are measured more by the quality of the field of
merit represented by the recipient than by the quantity and value of the gift
given.
<!--l. 40411--><p class="indent" >   The Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv,392-95) records a fabulous alms-giving conducted by
the Bodhisatta when he was born as a brahman named Velama. Lavish gifts of silver,
gold, elephants, cows, carriages, etc., not to mention food, drink and clothing,
were distributed among everybody who came forward to receive them. But
this open-handed munificence was not very valuable as far as merit was
concerned because there were no worthy recipients. It is said to be more
meritorious to feed one person with right view, a stream-enterer (sotapanna), than
to give great alms such as that given by Velama. It is more meritorious
to feed one once-returner than a hundred stream-enterers. Next in order
come non-returners, arahants, Paccekabuddhas and Sammasambuddhas.
Feeding the Buddha and the Sangha is more meritorious than feeding the
Buddha alone. It is even more meritorious to construct a monastery for the
general use of the Sangha of the four quarters of all times. Taking refuge
in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha is better still. Abiding by the Five
Precepts is even more valuable. But better still is the cultivation of metta,
loving-kindness, and best of all, the insight into impermanence, which leads to
Nibbana.
<!--l. 40430--><p class="indent" >   The Motivation for Giving
<!--l. 40432--><p class="indent" >   The suttas record various motives for exercising generosity. The Anguttara Nikaya
(A.iv,236) enumerates the following eight motives:
<!--l. 40435--><p class="indent" >   Asajja danam deti: one gives with annoyance, or as a way of offending the
recipient, or with the idea of insulting him.5
<!--l. 40438--><p class="indent" >   Bhaya danam deti: fear also can motivate a person to make an offering.
<!--l. 40440--><p class="indent" >   Adasi me ti danam deti: one gives in return for a favor done to oneself in the

past.
<!--l. 40443--><p class="indent" >   Dassati me ti danam deti one also may give with the hope of getting a similar
favor for oneself in the future.
<!--l. 40446--><p class="indent" >   Sadhu danan ti danam deti: one gives because giving is considered good.
<!--l. 40449--><p class="indent" >   Aham pacami, ime ne pacanti, na arahami pacanto apacantanam adatun ti
danam deti: "I cook, they do not cook. It is not proper for me who cooks
not to give to those who do not cook." Some give urged by such altruistic
motives.
<!--l. 40454--><p class="indent" >   Imam me danam dadato kalyano kittisaddo abbhuggacchati ti danam deti: some
give alms to gain a good reputation.
<!--l. 40457--><p class="indent" >   Cittalankara-cittaparikkarattham danam deti: still others give alms to adorn and
beautify the mind.
<!--l. 40460--><p class="indent" >   Favoritism (chanda), ill will (dosa) and delusion (moha) are also listed as motives
for giving. Sometimes alms are given for the sake of maintaining a long-standing
family tradition. Desire to be reborn in heaven after death is another dominant
motive. Giving pleases some and they give with the idea of winning a happy frame of
mind (A.iv, 236).
<!--l. 40467--><p class="indent" >   But it is maintained in the suttas (A.iv,62) that alms should be given without any
expectations (na sapekho danam deti). Nor should alms be given with attachment to
the recipient. If one gives with the idea of accumulating things for later use, that is
an inferior act of giving. If one gives with the hope of enjoying the result thereof after
death, that is also an inferior act of giving. The only valid motive for giving should
be the motive of adorning the mind, to rid the mind of the ugliness of greed and
selfishness.
<!--l. 40476--><p class="indent" >   The Manner of Giving
<!--l. 40478--><p class="indent" >   The suttas (e.g., A.iii,172) lay much emphasis on the manner of giving. The
attitude of the donor in the act of giving makes a world of difference for
the goodwill between the donor and recipient irrespective of whether the
gift given is big or small. Sakkaccam danam deti: alms should be given in
such a way that the donee does not feel humiliated, belittled or hurt. The
needy ask for something with a sense of embarrassment, and it is the duty of
the donor not to make him feel more embarrassed and make his already
heavy burden still heavier. Cittikatva danam deti: alms should be given
with due consideration and respect. The recipient should be make to feel
welcome. It is when a gift is given with such warmth that a cohesive mutually
enriching friendliness emerges between the donor and donee. Sahattha deti: one
should give with one&#8217;s own hand. The personal involvement in the act of
giving is greatly beneficial. This promotes rapport between the donor and
donee and that is the social value of giving. Society is welded in unity with
care and concern for one another when generosity is exercised with a warm
sense of personal involvement. Na apaviddham deti: one should not give as
alms what is only fit to be thrown away. One should be careful to give only
what is useful and appropriate. Na anagamanaditthiko deti: one should not
give in such a callous manner so as to make the donee not feel like coming
again.
<!--l. 40500--><p class="indent" >   Giving with faith (saddhaya deti) is much extolled in the suttas (A.iii,172).

Especially when offering alms to the clergy one should do so with due deference and
respect, taking delight in the opportunity one has got to serve them. Once should
also give at the proper time to meet a dire need (kalena deti). Such timely gifts are
most valuable as they relieve the anxiety and stress of the supplicant. One should
give with altruistic concerns, with the sole intention of helping another in difficulty
(anuggahacitto danam deti). In the act of giving one should take care not to hurt
oneself or another (attanan ca paran ca anupahacca danam deti). Giving
with understanding and discretion is praised by the Buddha (viceyyadanam
sugatappasattham). If a gift contributes to the well-being of the donee it is wise to
give. But if the gift is detrimental to the welfare of the donee one should be careful to
exercise one&#8217;s discretion. Giving as described above is highly commended as
noble giving (sappurisadana). More than what is given, it is the manner of
giving that makes a gift valuable. One may not be able to afford a lavish
gift, but one can always make the recipient feel cared for by the manner of
giving.
<!--l. 40519--><p class="indent" >   The Value of Giving
<!--l. 40521--><p class="indent" >   Many suttas enumerate the various benefits of giving. Giving promotes social
cohesion and solidarity. It is the best means of bridging the psychological gap, much
more than the material economic gap, that exists between haves and have-nots. The
Magha Sutta maintains that hates gets eliminated when one is established in
generosity (Sn. 506). The one with a generous heart earns the love of others and
many associate with him (A.iii,40). Giving also cements friendships (Sn.
187).
<!--l. 40529--><p class="indent" >   It is maintained that if a person makes an aspiration to be born in a particular
place after giving alms, the aspiration will be fulfilled only if he is virtuous, but not
otherwise (A.iv,239). According to one sutta (A.iv,241-43), if one practices giving and
morality to a very limited degree and has no idea about meditation, one obtains
an unfortunate birth in the human world. One who performs meritorious
deeds such as giving and morality to a considerable degree, but does not
understand anything about meditation, meets a fortunate human birth. But those
who practice giving and morality to a great extent without any knowledge
of meditation find rebirth in one of the heavens. They excel other deities
in the length of life, beauty, pleasure, fame and the five strands of sense
pleasure.
<!--l. 40542--><p class="indent" >   The Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv,79) enumerates a number of this-worldly benefits of
giving. The generous person, and not the miser, wins the sympathy of others.
arahants approach him, accept alms and preach to him first. A good reputation
spreads about him. He can attend any assembly with confidence and dignity. He is
reborn in a state of happiness after death. Another sutta (A.iii,41) adds that a
generous person wins popularity; people of noble character associate with him and he
has the satisfaction of having fulfilled a layperson&#8217;s duties (gihidhamma anapeto
hoti).
<!--l. 40552--><p class="indent" >   It is said that an almsgiver bestows on others life, beauty, happiness, strength and
intelligence. Having bestowed them on others, he becomes a beneficiary of them
himself (A.iii,42). The same idea is expressed by the succinct statement that
one reaps what one sows (yadisam vapate bijam tadisam harate phalam,

S.i,227).
<!--l. 40558--><p class="indent" >   Giving with faith results in the attainment of riches and beauty whenever the
fruition of the gift occurs. By giving alms with due deference one gains, in addition,
children, wives, subordinates and servants who are obedient, dutiful and
understanding. By giving alms at the proper time not only does one obtain great
wealth but also timely fulfillment of needs. By giving alms with the genuine desire to
help others, one gains great wealth and the inclination to enjoy the best of
sense pleasures. By giving alms without hurting oneself and others, one gains
security from dangers such as fire, floods, thieves, kings and unloved heirs (A.
iii,172).
<!--l. 40569--><p class="indent" >   Alms given to recluses and brahmans who follow the Noble Eightfold Path yield
wonderful results just as seeds sown on fertile, well-prepared, well-watered fields
produce abundant crops (A.iv,238). Alms given without any expectations whatsoever
can lead to birth in the Brahma-world, at the end of which one may become a
non-returner (A.iv,62).
<!--l. 40575--><p class="indent" >   The Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta enumerates a list of persons to whom alms can be
offered and the merit accruing therefrom in ascending order. A thing given to an
animal brings a reward a hundredfold. A gift given to an ordinary person of
poor moral habit yields a reward a thousandfold; a gift given to a virtuous
person yields a reward a hundred thousandfold. When a gift is given to a
person outside the dispensation of Buddhism who is without attachment to
sense pleasures, the yield is a hundred thousandfold of crores. When a gift
is given to one on the path to stream-entry the yield is incalculable and
immeasurable. So what can be said of a gift given to a stream-enterer, a
once-returner, a non-returner, an arahant, a Paccekabuddha, and a Fully Enlightened
Buddha?
<!--l. 40587--><p class="indent" >   The same sutta emphasizes that a gift given to the Sangha as a group is more
valuable than a gift offered to a single monk in his individual capacity. It is said that
in the distant future there will be Buddhist monks who wear only a yellow collar as a
distinguishing clerical mark, who are immoral and of evil character. If a gift is offered
even to such monks in the name of the Order, it yields much more merit than a
gift given to a monk in his individual capacity. But it should be observed
that this statement is contradictory to ideas expressed elsewhere, that what
is given to the virtuous is greatly beneficial but not what is given to the
immoral. It is evident here that a later interpolation cannot be altogether ruled
out.
<!--l. 40599--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha once explained that it is a meritorious act even to throw away the
water after washing one&#8217;s plate with the generous thought: "May the particles of
food in the washing water be food to the creatures on the ground." When
that is so, how much more meritorious it is to feed a human being! But the
sutta hastens to add that it is more meritorious to feed a virtuous person
(A.i,161).
<!--l. 40606--><p class="indent" >   Another sutta (A.iii,336) maintains that it is not possible to estimate the amount
of merit that accrues when an offering is endowed with six particular characteristics.
Three of the characteristics belong to the donor while three belong to the donee. The
donor should be happy at the thought of giving prior to making the offering. He

should be pleased at the time of making the offering, and he should be satisfied after
the offering is made. Thus the nobility of thought &#8212; without a trace of
greed before, during and after the offering &#8212; makes a gift truly great. The
recipients also should be free from lust, hatred and delusion, or they should
have embarked on a course of training for the elimination of these mental
depravities. When an almsgiving is endowed with these qualities of the donor
and donee, the merit is said to be as immeasurable as the waters in the
ocean.
<!--l. 40620--><p class="indent" >   Once Visakha gave a learned explanation of the benefits she expected from her
munificence when the Buddha questioned her as to what she saw as the advantages of
her great generosity (Vin.i,293-94). She said that when she hears that a
particular monk or nun has attained any of the fruits of recluseship, and
if that monk or nun has visited Savatthi, she would be certain that he or
she has partaken of the offerings she constantly makes. When she reflects
that she has contributed in some measure to his or her spiritual distinction,
great delight (pamujja) arises in her. Joy (piti) arises in the mind that is
delighted. When the mind is joyful the body relaxes (kayo passambhissati).
When the body relaxes a sense of ease (sukha) is experienced which helps
the mind to be concentrated (cittam samadhiyissati). That will help the
development of the spiritual faculties (indriyabhavana), spiritual powers
(balahbavana), and factors of enlightenment (bojjhangabhavana). These
are the advantages she hopes for by her munificence. The Buddha was so
pleased with her erudite reply that he exclaimed, "Sadhu sadhu sadhu" in
approbation.
<!--l. 40638--><p class="indent" >   It is evident that giving alone is not sufficient for one to make an end of suffering.
Anathapindika, who was pronounced by the Buddha as the foremost among
almsgivers, became only a stream-enterer. It is specifically said that dana has to be
fortified by sila, morality, if it is to produce good results. Though Anathapindika
practiced unblemished virtue, it is nowhere stated that he practiced mental culture or
meditation (bhavana). Therefore, in spite of all his magnanimous munificence, he had
to remain a stream-enterer.
<!--l. 40647--><p class="indent" >   The Ghatikara Sutta (M.ii,52) records a unique almsgiving where even the donor
was not present. Chatikara the potter was the chief benefactor of the Buddha
Kassapa. He was a non-returner who did not want to enter the Order as he was
looking after his blind, aged parents. He had greatly won the trust of the Buddha by
the nobility of his conduct and devotion. One day the Buddha Kassapa went to his
house on his alms round but Ghatikara was out. He asked the blind parents where
the potter had gone. They replied that he had gone out, but invited the
Buddha to serve himself from the pots and pans and partake of a meal. The
Buddha did so. When Ghatikara returned and inquired who had taken from
the food, the parents informed him that the Buddha had come and they
had requested him to help himself to a meal. Ghatikara was overjoyed to
hear this as he felt that the Buddha had so much trust in him. It is said
that the joy and happiness (pitisukha) he experienced did not leave him for
two weeks, and the parents&#8217; joy and happiness did not wane for a whole
week.

<!--l. 40664--><p class="indent" >   The same sutta reports that on another occasion the roof of the Buddha
Kassapa&#8217;s monastery started leaking. He sent the monks to Ghatikara&#8217;s house to
fetch some straw, but Ghatikara was out at the time. Monks came back and said
that there was no straw available there except what was on the roof. The
Buddha asked the monks to get the straw from the roof there. Monks started
stripping the straw from the roof and the aged parents of Ghatikara asked who
was removing the straw. The monks explained the matter and the parents
said, "Please do take all the straw." When Ghatikara heard about this he
was deeply moved by the trust the Buddha reposed in him. The joy and
happiness that arose in him did not leave him for a full fortnight and that
of his parents did not subside for a week. For three months Ghatikara&#8217;s
house remained without a roof with only the sky above, but it is said that
the rain did not wet the house. Such was the great piety and generosity of
Ghatikara.
<!--l. 40680--><p class="indent" >   As mentioned at the beginning of this essay, dana is the first of the meritorious
deeds. It is also one of the four benevolent ways of treating others (cattari
sangahavatthuni), A.iv,219). But is noteworthy that in the lists of virtues required for
liberation such as those included among the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment
(bodhipakkhiya dhamma),dana never occurs as a required virtue. Instead of
dana,caga or generosity is included in some of the lists, such as the five
qualities &#8212; faith virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom. Perhaps there
is a slight difference between dana and caga when considered as virtues
ingrained in the mind. Dana is the very practical act of giving, caga is the
generous attitude ingrained in the mind by the repeated practice of dana. The
word caga literally means giving up, abandonment, and it is an indication
that the close-fitted selfish grip one has on one&#8217;s possessions is loosened
by caga. It is possible to give alms even out of negative motives such as
favoritism (chanda), ill will (dosa), fear (bhaya), delusion (moha), desire
for a good reputation, etc., but caga is the positive virtue of a generous
disposition.
<!--l. 40698--><p class="indent" >   Buddhism teaches a gradual process of emptying oneself. It starts with giving
away one&#8217;s external possessions. When the generous dispositional trait sets in and is
fortified by the deepening insight into the real nature of things, one grows
disenchanted with sense pleasures (nibbindati). At this stage one gives up household
life and seeks ordination. Next comes the emptying of sensory inputs by
guarding the sense doors. Through meditation (bhavana) one empties oneself of
deep-seated defilements and fills oneself with positive noble qualities. But this
whole process of bailing out negativities starts with dana, the practice of
giving.
<!--l. 40708--><p class="indent" >   Giving from the Heart
<!--l. 40710--><p class="indent" >   by M. O&#8217;C. Walshe
<!--l. 40712--><p class="indent" >   Giving comes very naturally to some people &#8212; they enjoy giving and are unhappy
if they cannot do so. And though it is obvious that one can give foolishly, it is in
general a very good and meritorious thing to give. This is recognized in, probably, all
religions: in Christianity we are told that it is more blessed to give than to receive,
and in Islam there is a positive injunction to give part of one&#8217;s wealth to the

poor.
<!--l. 40720--><p class="indent" >   Perhaps, however, we ought to start by squarely facing a point which may worry
some people: the question of giving to the Sangha. In a phrase which lay Buddhists
may frequently hear chanted, or even chant themselves, the Sangha is described as
anuttaram punnakkhettam lokassa, "an unequalled field of merit-making for the
world," meaning that the merit to be gained by giving to the Sangha is
unequalled. Well of course, not all the lay people who hear or join in such
chanting know what the words mean, but of those who do, Westerners who are
Buddhists or Buddhist sympathizers sometimes react to this notion with a
degree of indignation, considering the words tactless or worse! In fact some,
whose conditioning was at least partly under the influence of the Lutheran
Christian tradition, are reminded of the abuses to which Martin Luther
objected in the Church of his day, when "good deeds" were very largely
associated in the popular mind with maintaining priests and monks, who in
some cases at least were idle and corrupt, in the style to which they were
accustomed.
<!--l. 40737--><p class="indent" >   Such misgivings are perhaps understandable, but can be countered by a proper
explanation, and will in any case not take root provided the Sangha is patently seen
to be well conducted (supatipanno). The traditional Buddhist community consists
of four groups: monks, nuns, male and female lay followers. Though the
original order of nuns has died out, there are women who have undertaken the
holy life and live virtually as nuns, and there is every indication that their
numbers will grow. The relation between the first two groups and the latter
two is one of symbiosis. After all, the Sangha has a priceless gift to give,
the gift of the Dhamma. Sabbadanam dhammadanam jinati: "The gift of
the Dhamma excels all other gifts" (Dhp. 354). Members of the Sangha
also have an inescapable obligation to live according to the Vinaya and to
strive continuously for enlightenment. It is in fact only by so doing that
they can claim to be "an unequalled field of merit-making," and if they
fail in this obligation they are letting down not only themselves but also
the laity who support them. A monk or nun who cannot observe the rules
should, and in certain cases must, leave the Order. This could be regarded,
at least in part, as the price to be paid for abusing the generosity of lay
supporters.
<!--l. 40758--><p class="indent" >   It was mentioned above that, according to the Bible, it is more blessed to
give than to receive. It is interesting to note that, just as in the practice of
metta-bhavana, the meditation on universal love, there is given an actual method for
fulfilling that difficult Judaeo-Christian injunction "love thy neighbor as thyself," so
too Buddhism can give a precise technical meaning to this biblical statement. If we
receive something pleasant, this in Buddhism is considered to be vipaka, the result of
previous meritorious conduct. It is nice while it lasts, but when it is finished, its
virtue is exhausted. To give, however is kusala kamma, skilled action, which will be
productive of some pleasant vipaka or result for the giver. In this way it can be
clearly seen to be more "blessed" to give than to receive. True, this "blessing"
remains purely mundane and limited, being "merit-making for the world"
(lokassa). But as all our actions are habit-forming, giving once inclines us to give

again, so that the result tends to be cumulative. Also, of course, this king of
kusala kamma can lead on to other things, and it is not for nothing that dana
is listed as the first among the ten paramis or "perfections," coming even
before sila or morality. It is, after all, possible for an immoral person to be
generous!
<!--l. 40780--><p class="indent" >   The late Dr. I.B.Horner selected ten Jataka stories to illustrate the ten
perfections, in a little book that is widely used as an introductory Pali reader, and
she used the delightful story of the self-sacrificing hare (No. 316) to illustrate
the perfection of giving. Strangely enough, though, to the Western mind
at least, the most popular Jataka story on this theme is the very last, the
Vessantara Jataka (No. 547), in which the Bodhisatta gives everything away
including, finally, his wife and children &#8212; a distinctly dubious moral, one
might think! But in Thailand this story has been singled out and is regularly
made the subject of special readings and sermons for the edification of the
laity.
<!--l. 40792--><p class="indent" >   Giving is something that comes from the heart, and as I have said, there are
people who enjoy giving for its own sake &#8212; which is fine provided the giving is
balanced with wisdom. There are of course other people who are reluctant givers, and
they are often the same people who find it difficult to say "please," "thank you,"
"I&#8217;m sorry," and so on. For all such types the brahmavihara meditations on
love and compassion would be beneficial, to enable them to open up their
hearts.
<!--l. 40802--><p class="indent" >   Recently, in Britain, we have had a magnificent example of the power of giving
from the heart, and from what to many must have seemed an unexpected source.
Moved by the plight of the starving people in Ethiopia, the rock star Bob Geldof
organized the fantastic international Live Aid concert which raised millions of pounds
&#8212; in its way, and with the aid of modern technology, the most spectacular act of
generosity in history, touching the hearts of millions, and transcending the
boundaries not only of politics and religions, but also that gulf that exists between
those addicted to this particular form of entertainment and those who dislike
it.
<!--l. 40813--><p class="indent" >   It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that dana has to be exercised
with discretion, and is as much subject to the rule of the middle way as
everything else. It is not the best way to bring up a child, for instance, to give it
everything it wants &#8212; or thinks it wants. Contrary to some trendy theories
recently current, it does no harm to frustrate a spoilt brat occasionally!
Nor, of course, is it the highest kind if giving if one expects something in
return &#8212; even a nice rebirth in some heavenly realm! That is a kind of giving
which is basically rooted in attachment and is therefore of limited kammic
value.
<!--l. 40824--><p class="indent" >   In point of fact, one of the true benefits to the giver is precisely that the act of
spontaneous giving is a very fine way of helping to overcome attachment. And that is
the intended point of the Vessantara story. We Westerners think of the unfortunate
wife and family the Bodhisatta "sacrificed" (though of course there was happy ending
and they came back to him, in the story!), but the intention is to regard them as
objects of attachment, to be given up as such. As a matter of fact, despite the

popularity of this particular story, modern scholars consider that it was not originally
a Buddhist tale at all, and was somewhat unskillfully adapted to provide a
"Buddhist" moral.
<!--l. 40836--><p class="indent" >   The more we consider the question of dana, the more aspects emerge, and we see
that there are many ways of giving, skillfully or otherwise. We may conclude with an
amusing canonical example of the alleged results of relatively unskillful giving. In the
Payasi Sutta (No. 23 of the Digha Nikaya) we read of the debate between the
skeptic Prince Payasi, who did not believe in an afterlife, and the Venerable
Kumara-Kassapa. After listening to a brilliant series of parables from the monk,
Payasi declares himself converted, and decides to establish a charity "for
ascetics and brahmans, wayfarers, beggars and the needy," and he appoints
the young brahman Uttara to organize the distribution. (N.B. This is the
correct version &#8212; there is an error in the Rhys Davids translation at his
point.) Uttara complains that the food and clothing he is called upon to
distribute are of such poor quality that Payasi would not touch them himself,
and Payasi finally gives him leave to supply "food as I eat and clothes as I
wear." At the conclusion of the sutta, we are told of the rewards the two men
received after death. Payasi, who had established the charity grudgingly, was
indeed reborn in a heavenly world, but in the very lowest, that of the Four
Great Kings, where he was lodged in the empty Serisaka mansion (vimana).
Here, indeed, he was visited by the Venerable Gavampati, an arahant who
made a habit of taking his siesta in the lower heavens. And so the story was
brought back to earth. But Uttara, who had reorganized the charity and
given from the heart, was born in a higher heaven, among the Thirty-three
Gods.
<!--l. 40862--><p class="indent" >   Probably few Westerners will give in order to be reborn among the Thirty-three
Gods, and perhaps the only reward some people look to is an easing of the
conscience: being aware of some particular need &#8212; of which the case of Ethiopia is
the outstanding current example &#8212; people feel unable to live with themselves if they
do not give something. This is certainly better than hoping for a heavenly
reward, but an easy conscience, too, may perhaps sometimes be purchased a
little too easily. Best let the giving itself be its own reward, and leave it at
that!
<!--l. 40872--><p class="indent" >   Generosity: The Inward Dimension
<!--l. 40874--><p class="indent" >   by Nina Van Gorkom
<!--l. 40876--><p class="indent" >   As from a heap of flowers many a garland is made, even so many good deeds
should be done by one born a mortal.
<!--l. 40879--><p class="indent" >   &#8212; Dhammapada 53
<!--l. 40881--><p class="indent" >   The giving away of useful or pleasant things is an act of generosity. However, if we
only pay attention to the outward deeds we do not know whether or not we are being
sincerely generous. We should learn more about the mind which motivates our deeds.
True generosity is difficult. While we are giving, our thoughts may not all be good
and noble. Our motives for giving may not all be pure. We may give with selfish
motives &#8212; expecting something in return, hoping to be liked by the receiver or our
gift, wanting to be known as a generous person. We may notice that there are
different thoughts at different moments, some truly generous, and others having

different motives.
<!--l. 40892--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught that there is no lasting mind or soul which undergoes
different experiences. Our experiences themselves are different moments of
consciousness, which arise one at a time and then fall away immediately.
Each moment of consciousness that arises and falls away is succeeded by
the next moment of consciousness. Our life is thus a series of moments of
consciousness arising in succession. Gradually we can learn to distinguish
different types of consciousness. There is consciousness which is unwholesome or
unskillful, and there is consciousness which is wholesome or skillful, and besides
these there are other types of consciousness which are neither wholesome
nor unwholesome. Only one type of consciousness occurs at a time, but
each type is accompanied by several mental factors. Unwholesome types
of consciousness are accompanied by unwholesome mental factors, such as
attachment, stinginess, jealousy or aversion. Wholesome types of consciousness are
accompanied by beautiful mental factors, such as generosity, kindness or
compassion.
<!--l. 40908--><p class="indent" >   Three of the unwholesome mental factors are "roots of evil."6 These are the
strong foundation of unwholesome types of consciousness: attachment or greed,
aversion or anger, and ignorance.
<!--l. 40913--><p class="indent" >   Each of these unwholesome factors has many shades and degrees. We may know
that there is attachment when we are greedy for food or desire to acquire someone
else&#8217;s property. However, we may not realize that there is also attachment when we
enjoy natural scenery or beautiful music. In society attachment of a subtle kind is
considered good, provided we do not harm others. The unwholesome has a wider
range than what we call in conventional language "immoral." It can include states
that are weaker than the immoral. We cannot force ourselves not to like beautiful
things; there are conditions for the arising of attachment. But we can learn to know
the difference between the moments which are wholesome and the moments which are
unwholesome. A degree of selfishness persists even in moments of subtle attachment.
These are different from selfless moments of consciousness accompanied by
generosity, when we do not think of our own enjoyment. There is attachment
time and again, when we stand up, move around, reach for things, eat or
go to sleep. We think of ourselves and want to acquire pleasant things for
ourselves. We expect other people to be nice to us, and this is also a form of
attachment.
<!--l. 40932--><p class="indent" >   We may wonder whether attachment to relatives is wholesome. Attachment to
relatives is not wholesome; it is different from pure loving-kindness, which is
wholesome. When we cling to the pleasant feeling we derive from the company of
relatives or dear friends, there is attachment. When we are genuinely concerned for
someone else we do not think of ourselves, and then there is wholesome
consciousness. We are so used to living with attachment that we may have never
considered the difference between the moments of attachment and the moments of
unselfish love. The different types of consciousness succeed one another so rapidly
that so long as we have not developed understanding of them, we do not notice that
they have changed.
<!--l. 40944--><p class="indent" >   The unwholesome root of aversion also has many degrees. It can manifest as slight

uneasiness or as coarse anger or hate. Aversion does not arise at the time as
attachment. When there is attachment consciousness likes the object that is
experienced and when there is aversion consciousness dislikes the object. Attachment
arises with certain types of consciousness, not with all types, and so does
aversion.
<!--l. 40951--><p class="indent" >   Ignorance is an unwholesome root that arises with all types of unwholesome
consciousness. It is the root of all evil. Ignorance does not know what is wholesome
and what is unwholesome, it does not know anything about what is real.
Whenever there is attachment or aversion, at the same time there is also
ignorance.
<!--l. 40957--><p class="indent" >   The three beautiful roots are: non-attachment or generosity, non-aversion or
kindness, and understanding or wisdom. Each type of wholesome consciousness is
rooted in non-attachment and non-aversion, and it may be rooted in understanding
as well. Each of these beautiful roots has many degrees. Without the assistance of
non-attachment and non-aversion wholesome consciousness could not arise
motivating acts of generosity. Attachment cannot exist at the same time
as generosity. When one is truly generous one gives impartially and does
not restrict one&#8217;s generosity to people one likes or to the members of one&#8217;s
family. The purpose of all kinds of wholesomeness should be to eliminate
defilements, to get rid of selfishness. The Buddha taught the wisdom that can
eradicate the clinging to the idea of self, but if one does not learn to get rid of
stinginess and clings to one&#8217;s possessions, one cannot give up the clinging to
self.
<!--l. 40972--><p class="indent" >   When we see that true generosity is beneficial and that selfishness and stinginess
are harmful, we would like to have more moments of generosity. However, in spite of
our wishes, we notice that unwholesome types of consciousness often arise. Then we
are disappointed with ourselves. We should acquire understanding of what
conditions the arising of unwholesome consciousness. We must have been full of
attachment, aversion and ignorance in the past, even in past lives. Such
tendencies have become deeply rooted; they have been accumulated. What
is past has gone already, but the unwholesome tendencies that have been
accumulated can condition the arising of unwholesome consciousness at the present
time.
<!--l. 40984--><p class="indent" >   We have accumulated not only tendencies to evil but also inclinations to the
wholesome. That is why there can also be moments of generosity and kindness at the
present time. When an unwholesome type of consciousness arises we accumulate
more unwholesomeness; when a wholesome type arises we accumulate more
wholesomeness.
<!--l. 40990--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught different ways of developing wholesomeness, and when we
learn about these ways there are already conditions for more wholesomeness. We find
opportunity for generosity not only while we are giving but also before the actual
giving, when we try to obtain the things we intend to give, and afterwards when we
recollect our giving. When we are honest with ourselves we can notice that before,
during and after the giving, opportunities for generosity are often spoilt by
unwholesome consciousness. We may get tired when we have to buy or prepare the
gift, and then aversion arises. While we are giving the gift the receiver may be

ungrateful and fail to respond to our gift in the way we expected and then we may be
disappointed.
<!--l. 41002--><p class="indent" >   However, when we have right understanding of what wholesomeness is, we should
be concerned only with developing wholesome states of mind and not with the
reactions of other people. Wholesomeness is wholesomeness and nobody else can
change the wholesome consciousness that arises. Before we learned about the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings we did not consider generosity in this way, we did not pay
attention to the moments of consciousness. Through the Buddha&#8217;s teachings we
learn about things as they really are. After the act of giving the opportunity
to recollect our generosity with wholesome consciousness can be wasted
by unwholesome consciousness. At first we may have been generous, but
afterwards we may find that the gift was too expensive and regret have spent our
money.
<!--l. 41015--><p class="indent" >   The Buddha taught that there is no self that can exert power over the different
types of consciousness that arise; they arise because of their appropriate
conditions. Through his teachings we can learn about the different types of
consciousness and about our accumulated tendencies. Thus there will be more
understanding of what is real, and this too is wholesome. When one has
accumulated the tendency to stinginess it is difficult to be generous, but
through the understanding of what the Buddha taught inclinations can be
changed.
<!--l. 41024--><p class="indent" >   We read in the commentary to the Subhabhojana Jataka (Stories of the Buddha&#8217;s
Former Births, Jatakas, Book V, No. 535) about a monk in the Buddha&#8217;s
time who practiced the utmost generosity. He gave away his food, and if he
received drink sufficient to fill the hollow of his hand, he would, free from
greed, still give it away. But formerly he used to be so stingy that "he would
not give so much as a drop of oil on the tip of a blade of grass." In one of
his past lives, when he was named Kosiya, he lived as a miser. One day he
had a craving for rice porridge. When his wife suggested that she would
cook porridge not only for him but also for all the inhabitants of Benares,
he felt "just as if he had been struck on the head with a stick." Then his
wife offered to cook for a single street, or only for the attendants in his
house, only for the family, only for the two of them, but he turned down all
her offers. He wanted porridge cooked for himself alone, in the forest, so
that nobody else could see it. The Bodhisatta, who was at that time the
god Sakka, wanted to convert him and came to him with four attendants
disguised as brahmans. One by one they approached the miser and begged for
some of his porridge. Sakka spoke the following stanza, praising generosity
(387):
<!--l. 41045--><p class="indent" >   From little one should little give, from moderate means likewise, From much give
much: of giving nothing no question can arise. This then I tell you, Kosiya, give alms
of that is thine: Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine, By charity
you may ascend the noble path divine.
<!--l. 41051--><p class="indent" >   Kosiya reluctantly offered them some porridge. Then one of the brahmans
changed into a dog. The dog made water and a drop of it fell on Kosiya&#8217;s hand.
Kosiya went to the river to wash and then the dog made water in Kosiya&#8217;s cooking

pot. When Kosiya threatened him he changed into a "blood horse" and pursued
Kosiya. Then Sakka and his attendants stood in the air and Sakka preached to
Kosiya out of compassion and warned him of an unhappy rebirth. Kosiya came to
understand the danger of stinginess. He gave away all his possessions and became an
ascetic.
<!--l. 41061--><p class="indent" >   We may find it difficult to part with our possessions, but when we die we cannot
take them with us. Life is short: thus when we have an opportunity for generosity we
should use it in order to combat selfishness. Each moment of generosity now will
condition the arising of generosity in the future.
<!--l. 41067--><p class="indent" >   Good deeds bring about pleasant results and bad deeds bring unpleasant results.
This is the law of kamma and its fruit, of cause and effect.7 A deed (kamma) can
produce result in the form of rebirth. Wholesome kamma can produce a happy
rebirth and unwholesome kamma can produce an unhappy rebirth. Besides the
human plane of existence, there are other planes which are happy or unhappy. Birth
in the human plane or in a heavenly plane is a happy rebirth conditioned by
wholesome kamma; birth in a hell plane, as a ghost or as an animal is an unhappy
rebirth conditioned by unwholesome kamma. Kamma can also produce results in the
form of pleasant or unpleasant sense experiences arising in the course of life. Seeing
and hearing are types of consciousness that are results of kamma. We see and hear
pleasant or unpleasant objects according to the kamma that produces these
experiences.
<!--l. 41081--><p class="indent" >   Stinginess can bring about &#8212; either in this life or in a future life &#8212; the very
result we fear: loss of possessions. Generosity can bring about pleasant results, such
as prosperity. However, when we perform acts of generosity we should not cling to
pleasant results; clinging is unwholesome. Kamma will produce its appropriate result
whether we think of it or not. While we are giving we can have right understanding
of kamma and its result, without clinging. We may do good deeds with the
understanding of what wholesomeness is. As we have seen, understanding is a
beautiful root which may or may not accompany wholesome consciousness. When
understanding accompanies the wholesome consciousness, it increases the degree of
wholesomeness. We cannot make understanding arise at will; it arises when there are
conditions for it. Learning what the Buddha taught is a condition for greater
understanding.
<!--l. 41096--><p class="indent" >   There are still other ways of practicing generosity, even when we do not have
things to give. The application of other people&#8217;s good deeds is also a type of
generosity. When we notice that someone else is doing a good deed we can appreciate
his wholesomeness, and we may express this with words of approval and praise. We
may be stingy not only with regard to our possessions but also with regard to words
of praise. Gradually one can learn to be generous in appreciating the wholesomeness
of others.
<!--l. 41105--><p class="indent" >   In Thailand I had an opportunity to learn about this way of generosity, which I
had not heard of before. I received a book that was printed on the occasion of the
birthday of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand. This book mentioned many of
her good works, such as promoting the teaching of Buddhism, supporting
temples, improving the standard of living of the people in the provinces by
setting up different projects for them. When one reads this one can sincerely

admire and rejoice in the good works of Her Majesty. In Thailand I also
often heard the Thais saying, "anumodana," which means "thanks," with
the inclination of their head and clasped hands. This they do when they
respect and appreciate the wholesomeness of others, usually on occasions of
presenting food to the monks or giving books on the Buddhist teachings.
It can become a wholesome custom to express one&#8217;s appreciation on such
occasions.
<!--l. 41120--><p class="indent" >   When we know about this way of generosity we may remember to speak about
others with wholesome consciousness. In the development of wholesomeness one
has to be farsighted. One should realize that whatever wholesomeness or
unwholesomeness one accumulates today will produce its effects in the future, even in
future lives. One can become more adept in evaluating the circumstances one
is in and the friends one has. One will then be able to judge whether or
not one&#8217;s surroundings and friends are favorable for the development of
wholesomeness. One will know what kind of speech should be avoided, what
kind of speech cultivated. Often conversation tends to be about the bad
qualities of others or about useless matters which are not helpful for the
development of wholesomeness. Since we often become engaged in conversation with
others, we should learn how to turn the conversation into an opportunity for
wholesomeness.
<!--l. 41135--><p class="indent" >   Another way of generosity is the "sharing" of one&#8217;s wholesome deeds with others.
This does not mean that other people can receive the pleasant results of
our good deeds. The Buddha taught that beings are "heirs" to their deeds.
We each receive the results of the deeds we have done ourselves. Sharing
wholesomeness with others means that our good deeds can be the condition
for the arising of wholesome consciousness in others when they rejoice in
our good deeds. We can share wholesomeness even with beings in other
planes of existence, provided they are in planes where they can receive the
benefits.
<!--l. 41146--><p class="indent" >   The commentary to the Without the Walls Sutta8 narrates that King Bimbisara
offered a meal to the Buddha and omitted to dedicate his merits to other beings.
Ghosts, his relatives in a former life, had hoped for this in vain, and because they
were disappointed, in their despair they made a horrible screeching noise
throughout the night. The Buddha explained to King Bimbisara why the ghosts
had screeched. Then King Bimbisara made another offering and uttered the
dedication, "Let this be for those relatives." The ghosts benefited from his gifts
immediately; they had wholesome states of consciousness and their sufferings were
allayed. Lotus-covered pools were generated for them in which they could
bathe and drink, and they took on the color of gold. Heavenly food, heavenly
clothing and heavenly palaces manifested spontaneously for their use. This
story illustrates that one can share one&#8217;s good deeds with departed ones.
If one&#8217;s departed relatives are not able to receive the merit, other beings
can.
<!--l. 41163--><p class="indent" >   It is understandable that we are sad when we lose loved ones, but if we know how
to develop what is wholesome we can find great consolation. Instead of becoming
filled with sadness and aversion, we should dedicate our good deeds to all those who

are able to rejoice in them, then our consciousness will be wholesome. It can become
our custom to share wholesomeness with others; we need not even specify to whom
we wish to dedicate it.
<!--l. 41171--><p class="indent" >   It is a Buddhist custom when a meal or robes are offered to monks to pour water
over one&#8217;s hands while the monks recite words of blessings, in order to give expression
to one&#8217;s intention to dedicate this deed to other beings. The water symbolizes a river
which fills the ocean, and even so a wholesome deed is so plentiful that it can also be
shared with others.
<!--l. 41178--><p class="indent" >   Good deeds are usually classified as threefold: as generosity, morality, and mental
development. This threefold classification should not be considered a rigid one.
Morality, or abstinence from evil deeds, can also be seen as an aspect of generosity,
as an act of kindness to others. When we abstain from evil deeds we give
other beings the opportunity to live in peace, free from harm. If we want
to develop generosity, we should not neglect mental development &#8212; the
development of wholesome states of mind. We should know when consciousness is
unwholesome and when wholesome in order to develop generosity and other good
qualities. Knowing more about one&#8217;s different types of consciousness is mental
development.
<!--l. 41190--><p class="indent" >   The "stream-winner" is the noble person at the first stage of enlightenment.
He has developed right understanding of the different mental and physical
phenomena that appear at the present moment and has seen realities as they
are. With the attainment of enlightenment he experiences Nibbana, the
unconditioned reality, for the first time. At the moment of enlightenment the
wrong view of self is eradicated, and with it stinginess too is destroyed.
Stinginess can never arise again, and he thus has perfect generosity. An
ordinary person may be able to suppress stinginess temporarily, for example,
at the time of giving, but stinginess is bound to arise again so long as its
accumulated tendency remains. The stream-winner, through right understanding,
has eradicated the tendency to stinginess and can never be overcome by it
anymore.
<!--l. 41204--><p class="indent" >   Learning from the Buddha&#8217;s teachings how to develop wholesomeness and to
eradicate defilements is the greatest blessing. Therefore the teaching of the Dhamma,
the Buddha&#8217;s teaching, should be considered as the giving of the highest gift.
In learning what the Buddha taught and in developing wholesomeness we
correct our views about what is worthwhile striving for and what is not,
about what is real and what is mere illusion. Before we heard about the
Buddha&#8217;s teachings we may have considered the enjoyment of pleasant sense
objects to be the goal of our life. After we learn the Buddha&#8217;s teachings we
may gradually come to see that selfish attachment gives unrest of mind and
that it is harmful to ourselves and others. We may come to understand that
wholesomeness is beneficial both for ourselves and for others, that it brings peace of
mind.
<!--l. 41218--><p class="indent" >   Our outlook on what is worthwhile in life can change. We correct our views about
reality when we understand what wholesome kamma is and what unwholesome
kamma is, when we understand that kamma brings its appropriate result. We correct
our views when we understand that not a self but different types of consciousness,

wholesome and unwholesome, motivate our deeds, when we understand that these
types of consciousness arise because of different conditioning factors. There are many
degrees of correcting one&#8217;s views. By developing understanding of realities the
wrong view of self can be eradicated, and thereby perfect generosity can
emerge. The effect of learning the Dhamma should be that we become less
selfish and more generous, that we have more genuine concern for other
people.
<!--l. 41231--><p class="indent" >   The Perfection of Giving
<!--l. 41233--><p class="indent" >   by Acariya Dhammapala
<!--l. 41235--><p class="indent" >   From the Cariyapitaka Atthakatha, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in The
Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views: The Brahmajala Sutta and Its
Commentaries (BPS, 1978), pp. 289-96, pp. 322-23.
<!--l. 41239--><p class="indent" >   The perfection of giving is to be practiced by benefiting beings in many ways &#8212;
by relinquishing one&#8217;s happiness, belongings, body and life to others, by dispelling
their fear, and by instructing them in the Dhamma.
<!--l. 41244--><p class="indent" >   Herein, giving is threefold by way of the object to be given: the giving of material
things (amisadana), the giving of fearlessness (abhayadana), and the giving of the
Dhamma (dhammadana). Among these, the object to be given can be twofold:
internal and external. The external gift is tenfold: food, drink, garments,
vehicles, garlands, scents, unguents, bedding, dwellings, and lamps. These gifts,
again, become manifold by analyzing each into its constituents, e.g., food
into hard food, soft food, etc. The external gift can also become sixfold
when analyzed by way of sense objects: visible forms, sounds, smells, tastes,
tangibles, and non-sensory objects. The sense objects, such as visible forms,
become manifold when analyzed into blue, etc. So too, the external gift is
manifold by way of the divers valuables and belongings, such as gems, gold,
silver, pearls, coral, etc.; fields, land, parks, etc.; slaves, cows, buffaloes,
etc.
<!--l. 41259--><p class="indent" >   When the Great Man (the Bodhisatta) gives an external object, he gives whatever
is needed to whomever stands in need of it; and knowing by himself that someone is
in need of something, he gives it even unasked, much more when asked. He gives
sufficiently, not insufficiently, when there is something to be given. He does not give
because he expects something in return. And when there is not enough to give
sufficiently to all, he distributes evenly whatever can be shared. But he does not give
things that issue in affliction for others, such as weapons, poisons, and intoxicants.
Nor does he give amusements which are harmful and lead to negligence. And he does
not give unsuitable food or drink to a person who is sick, even though he
might ask for it, and he does not give what is suitable beyond the proper
measure.
<!--l. 41272--><p class="indent" >   Again, when asked, he gives to householders things appropriate for householders,
and to monks things appropriate for monks. He gives to his mother and father,
kinsmen and relatives, friends and colleagues, children, wife, slaves, and workers,
without causing pain to anyone. Having promised an excellent gift, he does not
give something mean. He does not give because he desires gain, honor, or
fame, or because he expects something in return, or out of expectation of
some fruit other than the supreme enlightenment. He does not give detesting

the gift or those who ask. He does not give a discarded object as a gift,
not even to unrestrained beggars who revile and abuse him. Invariable he
gives with care, with a serene mind, full of compassion. He does not give
through belief in superstitious omens: but he gives believing in kamma and its
fruit.
<!--l. 41286--><p class="indent" >   When he gives he does not afflict those who ask by making them do homage to
him, etc.; but he gives without afflicting others. He does not give a gift with
the intention of deceiving others or with the intention of injuring; he gives
only with an undefiled mind. He does not give a gift with harsh words or a
frown, but with words of endearment, congenial speech, and a smile on his
face.
<!--l. 41293--><p class="indent" >   Whenever greed for a particular object becomes excessive, due to its high value
and beauty, its antiquity, or personal attachment, the Bodhisatta recognizes his
greed, quickly dispels it, seeks out some recipients, and gives it away. And if
there should be an object of limited value that can be given and a suppliant
expecting it, without a second thought he bestirs himself and gives it to him,
honoring him as though he were an uncelebrated sage. Asked for his own
children, wife, slaves, workers, and servants, the Great Man does not give them
while they are as yet unwilling to go, afflicted with grief. But when they are
willing and joyful, then he gives them. But if he knows that those who ask for
them are demonic beings &#8212; ogres, demons, or goblins &#8212; or men of cruel
disposition, then he does not give them away. So too, he will not give his
kingdom to those intent on the harm, suffering, and affliction of the world,
but he would give it away to righteous men who protect the world with
Dhamma.
<!--l. 41309--><p class="indent" >   This, firstly, is the way to practice the giving of external gifts.
<!--l. 41311--><p class="indent" >   The internal gift should be understood in two ways. How? Just as a man, for the
sake of food and clothing, surrenders himself to another and enters into
servitude and slavery, in the same way the Great Man, wishing for the supreme
welfare and happiness of all beings, desiring to fulfill his own perfection
of giving, with a spiritually-oriented mind, for the sake of enlightenment,
surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude, placing himself at
the disposal of others. Whatever limbs or organs of his might be needed by
others &#8212; hands, feet, eyes, etc. &#8212; he gives them away to those who need
them, without trembling and without cowering. He is no more attached to
them, and no more shrinks away (from giving them to others), than if they
were external objects. Thus the Great Man relinquishes an internal object
in two ways: for the enjoyment of others according to their pleasure; or,
while fulfilling the wishes of those who ask, for his own self-mastery. In this
matter he is completely generous, and thinks: "I will attain enlightenment
through non-attachment." Thus the giving of the internal gift should be
understood.
<!--l. 41329--><p class="indent" >   Herein, giving an internal gift, he gives only what leads to the welfare of the
recipient, and nothing else. The Great Man does not knowingly give his own body,
limbs, and organs to Mara or to the malevolent deities in Mara&#8217; s company, thinking:
"Let this not lead to their harm." And likewise, he does not give to those possessed

by Mara or his deities, or to madmen. But when asked for these things by others, he
gives immediately, because of the rarity of such a request and the difficulty of making
such a gift.
<!--l. 41338--><p class="indent" >   The giving of fearlessness is the giving of protection to beings when they have
become frightened on account of kings, thieves, fire, water, enemies, lions, tigers,
other wild beasts, dragons, ogres, demons, goblins, etc.
<!--l. 41343--><p class="indent" >   The giving of the Dhamma is an unperverted discourse on the Dhamma given
with an undefiled mind; that is, methodical instruction conducive to good in the
present life, to good in the life to come, and to ultimate deliverance. By means of
such discourses, those who have not entered the Buddha&#8217;s Dispensation enter it,
while those who have entered it reach maturity therein.
<!--l. 41350--><p class="indent" >   This is the method: In brief, he gives a talk on giving, on virtue, and on heaven,
on the unsatisfactoriness and defilement in sense pleasures, and on the benefit in
renouncing them. In detail, to those whose minds are disposed towards the
enlightenment of disciples (savakabodhi) he gives a discourse establishing and
purifying them (in progress towards their goal) by elaborating upon the noble
qualities of whichever among the following topics is appropriate: going for refuge,
restraint by virtue, guarding the doors of the sense-faculties, moderation in eating,
application to wakefulness, the seven good dhammas; application to serenity
(samatha) by practicing meditation on one of the thirty-eight objects (of serenity
meditation); application to insight (vipassana) by contemplating the objects of
insight-interpretation such as the material body; the progressive stages of purification
(visuddhipatipada), the apprehension of the course of rightness (sammattagahana),
the three kinds of clear knowledge (vijja), the six kinds of direct knowledge
(abhiñña), the four discriminations (patisambhida), and the enlightenment of a
disciple.
<!--l. 41368--><p class="indent" >   So too, for beings whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of
paccekabuddhas and of perfectly enlightened Buddhas, he gives a discourse
establishing and purifying them in the two vehicles (leading to these two types of
enlightenment) by elaborating upon the greatness of the spiritual power of those
Buddhas, and by explaining the specific nature, characteristic, function, etc., of the
ten paramis in their three stages. Thus the Great Man gives the gift of the Dhamma
to beings.
<!--l. 41376--><p class="indent" >   When he gives a material gift, the Great Man gives food thinking: "May I, by this
gift, enable beings to achieve long life, beauty, happiness, strength, intelligence, and
the supreme fruit of unsullied bliss." He gives drink wishing to allay the
thirst of sensual defilements; garments to gain the adornments of shame
and moral dread and the golden complexion (of a Buddha); vehicles for
attaining the modes of psychic potency and the bliss of Nibbana; scents for
producing the sweet scent of virtue; garlands and unguents for producing the
beauty of the Buddha-qualities; seats for producing the seat on the terrace of
enlightenment; bedding for producing the bed of a Tathagata&#8217;s rest; dwellings so he
might become a refuge for beings; lamps so he might obtain the five eyes.9
He gives visible forms for producing the fathom-wide aura (surrounding a
Buddha); sounds for producing the Brahma-like voice (of a Buddha); tastes for
endearing himself to all the world; and tangibles for acquiring a Buddha&#8217;s

elegance.
<!--l. 41393--><p class="indent" >   He gives medicines so he might later give the ageless and deathless state of
Nibbana. He gives slaves the gift of freedom so he might later emancipate beings
from the slavery of the defilements. He gives blameless amusements and
enjoyments in order to produce delight in the true Dhamma. He gives his own
children as a gift in order that he might adopt all beings as his children by
granting them an ariyan birth. He gives his wives as a gift in order that he
might become master over the entire world. He gives gifts of gold, gems,
pearls, coral, etc., in order to achieve the major marks of physical beauty
(characteristic of a Buddha&#8217;s body), and gifts of the diverse means of beautification
in order to achieve the minor features of physical beauty.10 He gives his
treasuries as a gift in order to obtain the treasury of the true Dhamma; the
gift of his kingdom in order to become the king of the Dhamma; the gift of
monasteries, parks, ponds, and groves in order to achieve the jhanas, etc.;
the gift of his feet in order that he might be marked with the auspicious
wheels; the gift of his hands in order that he might give to beings the rescuing
hand of the true Dhamma to help them across the four floods;11 the gift of
his ears, nose, etc., in order to obtain the spiritual faculties of faith, etc.;
the gift of his eyes in order to obtain the universal eye; the gift of his flesh
and blood with the thought: "May my body be the means of life for all
the world! May it bring welfare and happiness to all beings at all times,
even on occasions of merely seeing, hearing, recollecting, or ministering to
me!" And he gives the gift of his head in order to become supreme in all the
world.
<!--l. 41420--><p class="indent" >   Giving thus, the Great Man does not give unwillingly, nor by afflicting others, nor
out of fear, moral shame, or the scolding of those in need of gifts. When there is
something excellent, he does not give what is mean. He does not give extolling
himself and disparaging others. He does not give out of desire for the fruit, nor
with loathing for those who ask, nor with lack of consideration. Rather,
he gives thoroughly, with his own hand, at the proper time, considerately,
without discrimination, filled with joy throughout the three times.12 Having
given, he does not become remorseful afterwards. He does not become either
conceited or obsequious in relation to the recipients, but behaves amiably
towards them. Bountiful and liberal, he gives things together with a bonus
(saparivara). For when he gives food, thinking: "I will give this along with a bonus,"
he gives garments, etc., as well. And when he gives garments, thinking: "I
will give this along with a bonus," he gives food, etc., as well. The same
method with gifts of vehicles, etc. And when he gives a gift of one of the
sense objects, such as visible forms, he gives the other sense objects also as a
bonus.
<!--l. 41439--><p class="indent" >   The gift of visible forms should be understood thus. Having gained something,
such as a flower, garment, or relic of a blue, yellow, red, or white color, etc.,
considering it in terms of its visible form, thinking to make a gift of a visible form, he
offers it to a worthy recipient together with its base.
<!--l. 41445--><p class="indent" >   The gift of sounds should be understood by way of the sounds of drums, etc. It is
certainly not possible to give a sound as one gives a cluster of lotuses, tearing it out

by its bulb and roots and placing it in the hands. But one gives a gift of sound by
giving its base. Thus he makes a gift of sound by presenting a musical instrument,
such as drums or tom toms, to the Triple Gem; or by giving medicine for the voice,
such as oil and molasses, to preachers of the Dhamma; or by announcing a
lecture on the Dhamma, chanting the scriptures, giving a discourse on the
Dhamma, holding a discussion, or expressing appreciation for the good deeds of
others.
<!--l. 41456--><p class="indent" >   The gift of scents is made when, after getting a delightfully scented object, such
as scented roots, powdered scent, etc., considering it in terms of its scent, thinking to
make a gift of scent, he offers it to the Triple Gem. He relinquishes a scented
object such as agaru or sandalwood, for the purpose of making an offering of
scent.
<!--l. 41462--><p class="indent" >   The gift of tastes is made when, after getting a delightfully flavored object, such
as flavored roots, etc., considering it in terms of its taste, thinking to make a gift of
taste, he gives it to worthy recipients. Or he relinquishes a flavorful object, such as
grain, cows, etc.13
<!--l. 41467--><p class="indent" >   The gift of tangibles should be understood by way of beds, chairs, etc., and by
way of coverlets and mantels, etc. For having gained some soft, delightful,
blameless tangible object, such as a bed, chair, cushion, pillow, undergarment, or
uppergarment, considering it in terms of its tangible qualities, thinking to make a gift
of a tangible item, he gives it to worthy recipients; having gained the aforesaid
tangible objects, he relinquishes them.
<!--l. 41475--><p class="indent" >   The gift of mental objects (dhammadana) should be understood by way of
nutriment, drink, and life, since it is the mental-object base which is here intended.14
Having gained a delightful object such as nutriment, considering it as part of the
mental-object base, thinking to make a gift of a non-sensory object, he gives
nutriment &#8212; i.e., ghee, butter, etc., or a drink &#8212; i.e., the eight kinds of drink such as
mango juice, etc.; or, considering it a gift of life, he gives a ticket-meal or a
fortnightly meal, etc., gets doctors to wait upon the sick and afflicted, liberates
animals from a net, has a fishing net or bird-cage destroyed, releases prisoners from
prison, causes an injunction to be given forbidding the slaughter of animals, or
undertakes any action of a similar nature for the sake of protecting the life of
beings.
<!--l. 41489--><p class="indent" >   This entire accomplishment in giving he dedicates to the welfare and happiness of
the whole world, and to his own unshakable emancipation through supreme
enlightenment. He dedicates it to the attainment of inexhaustible desire (for the
good), inexhaustible concentration, ingenuity, knowledge, and emancipation. In
practicing the perfection of giving the Great Being should apply the perception of
impermanence to life and possessions. He should consider them as shared in common
with many, and should constantly and continuously arouse great compassion towards
beings. Just as, when a house is blazing, the owner removes all his property of
essential value and himself as well without leaving anything important behind, so
does the Great Man invariably give, without discrimination and without
concern.
<!--l. 41502--><p class="indent" >   When the Great Man has made a mental determination to completely
relinquish whatever possessions come his way, whether animate or inanimate,

there are four shackles to giving (which he must overcome), namely, not
being accustomed to giving in the past, the inferiority of the object to be
given, the excellence and beauty of the object, and worry over the loss of the
object.
<!--l. 41509--><p class="indent" >   (1) When the Bodhisatta possesses objects that can be given and suppliants are
present, but his mind does not leap up at the thought of giving and he does not want
to give, he should conclude: "Surely, I have not been accustomed to giving in the
past, therefore a desire to give does not arise now in my mind. So that my mind will
delight in giving in the future, I will give a gift. With an eye for the future let me
now relinquish what I have to those in need." Thus he gives a gift &#8212; generous,
openhanded, delighting in relinquishing, one who gives when asked, delighting in
giving and in sharing. In this way the Great Being destroys, shatters, and eradicates
the first shackle to giving.
<!--l. 41521--><p class="indent" >   (2) Again, when the object to be given is inferior or defective, the Great Being
reflects: "Because I was not inclined to giving in the past, at present my requisites
are defective. Therefore, though it pains me, let me give whatever I have
as a gift even if the object is low and inferior. In that way I will, in the
future, reach the peak in the perfection of giving." Thus he gives whatever
kind of gift he can &#8212; generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishing,
one who gives when asked, delighting in giving and in sharing. In this way
the Great Being destroys, shatters, and eradicates the second shackle to
giving.
<!--l. 41532--><p class="indent" >   (3) When a reluctance to give arises due to the excellence or beauty of the
object to be given, the Great Being admonishes himself: "Good man, haven&#8217;t
you made the aspiration for the supreme enlightenment, the loftiest and
most superior of all states? Well then, for the sake of enlightenment, it is
proper for you to give excellent and beautiful objects as gifts." Thus he
gives what is excellent and beautiful &#8212; generous, open-handed, delighting in
relinquishing, one who gives when asked, delighting in giving and in sharing. In this
way the Great Man destroys, shatters, and eradicates the third shackle to
giving.
<!--l. 41543--><p class="indent" >   (4) When the Great Being is giving a gift, and he sees the loss of the object being
given, he reflects thus: "This is the nature of material possessions, that they are
subject to loss and to passing away. Moreover, it is because I did not give such
gifts in the past that my possessions are now depleted. Let me then give
whatever I have as a gift, whether it be limited or abundant. In that way I will,
in the future, reach the peak in the perfection of giving." Thus he gives
whatever he has as a gift &#8212; generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishing,
one who gives when asked, delighting in giving and in sharing. In this way
the Great Being destroys, shatters, and eradicates the fourth shackle to
giving.
<!--l. 41555--><p class="indent" >   Reflecting upon them thus in whatever way is appropriate is the means for
dispelling the harmful shackles to the perfection of giving. The same method used for
the perfection of giving also applies to the perfection of virtue and the other
perfections.
