<!--l. 53909--><p class="noindent" >Translated by Thomas Byrom
<!--l. 53911--><p class="indent" >   The Dhammapada, an anthology of 423 verses, has long been recognised as
one of the masterpieces of early Buddhist literature. From ancient times
to the present, the Dhammapada has been regarded as the most succinct
expression of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching found in the Theravada Pali Canon of
scriptures known as the Khuddaka Nikaya ("Minor Collection") of the Sutta
Pitaka.
<!--l. 53918--><p class="indent" >   This Dhammapada palm leaf manuscript (44.5 * 6.5 cm) in Sinhalese characters,

the scripture. Photo: Courtesy of K. D. Paranavitana, Assistant Archivist,

<!--l. 53924--><p class="indent" >   Buddhist tradition has it that shortly after the passing away of the Buddha his
disciples met in council at Rajagaha for the purpose of recalling to mind the truths
they had received from their beloved Teacher during the forty-five years of his
ministry. Their hope was to implant the principles of his message so firmly in
memory that they would become a lasting impetus to moral and spiritual conduct,
for themselves, their disciples, and for all future disciples who would seek to follow in
the footsteps of the Awakened One.
<!--l. 53933--><p class="indent" >   With the Teacher no longer among them, the monks found themselves with the
responsibility of handing on the teaching as faithfully as possible. Having no written
texts to rely on, they did as their ancestors had before them and prepared their
discourses for recitation, that is, basic themes were repeated with variations in order
to impress the ideas on their hearers. At that time, according to the Sinhalese, the
Dhammapada was orally assembled from the sayings of Gautama given on some three
hundred different occasions.
<!--l. 53942--><p class="indent" >   Subsequently, several renditions of the Dhammapada in the Sanskrit and Chinese
languages came into circulation. Likewise, a number of stanzas are to be
found almost verbatim in other texts of the canonical literature, testifying to
the esteem in which its content was anciently held. Since first collated, the
Dhammapada has become one of the best loved of Buddhist scriptures, recited
daily by millions of devotees who chant its verses in Pali or in their native
dialect.
<!--l. 53950--><p class="indent" >   It was inevitable that differences in interpretation of teaching as well as of
disciplinary practices would arise, with the result that about a century after the First
Council was held a second gathering was called to affirm the purity of the doctrine. It
was at this Second Council that the Arhats divided into two main streams, namely,
the Mahasanghika or "Great Assembly" and the Theravada or "Doctrine of Elders."
These gradually developed into the Mahayana or Northern School of Buddhism

espoused chiefly in India, Tibet, China, and later Japan, and the Hinayana or
Southern School whose stronghold is Sri Lanka, Burma, and the countries of
Southeast Asia.

<!--l. 53983--><p class="indent" >   The Noble Eightfold Path describes the way to the end of suffering, as it was laid
out by Siddhartha Gautama. It is a practical guideline to ethical and mental
development with the goal of freeing the individual from attachments and delusions;
and it finally leads to understanding the truth about all things. Together with the
Four Noble Truths it constitutes the gist of Buddhism. Great emphasis is put on the
practical aspect, because it is only through practice that one can attain a higher level
of existence and finally reach Nirvana. The eight aspects of the path are
not to be understood as a sequence of single steps, instead they are highly
interdependent principles that have to be seen in relationship with each
other.
<!--l. 53995--><p class="indent" >   1. Right View
<!--l. 53997--><p class="indent" >   Right view is the beginning and the end of the path, it simply means
to see and to understand things as they really are and to realise the Four
Noble Truth. As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom. It means
to see things through, to grasp the impermanent and imperfect nature of
worldly objects and ideas, and to understand the law of karma and karmic
conditioning. Right view is not necessarily an intellectual capacity, just as wisdom is
not just a matter of intelligence. Instead, right view is attained, sustained,
and enhanced through all capacities of mind. It begins with the intuitive
insight that all beings are subject to suffering and it ends with complete
understanding of the true nature of all things. Since our view of the world forms
our thoughts and our actions, right view yields right thoughts and right
actions.
<!--l. 54011--><p class="indent" >   2. Right Intention
<!--l. 54013--><p class="indent" >   While right view refers to the cognitive aspect of wisdom, right intention refers to
the volitional aspect, i.e. the kind of mental energy that controls our actions.
Right intention can be described best as commitment to ethical and mental
self-improvement. Buddha distinguishes three types of right intentions: 1. the
intention of renunciation, which means resistance to the pull of desire, 2. the
intention of good will, meaning resistance to feelings of anger and aversion, and 3. the
intention of harmlessness, meaning not to think or act cruelly, violently, or
aggressively, and to develop compassion.

<!--l. 54023--><p class="indent" >   3. Right Speech
<!--l. 54025--><p class="indent" >   Right speech is the first principle of ethical conduct in the eightfold path. Ethical
conduct is viewed as a guideline to moral discipline, which supports the other
principles of the path. This aspect is not self-sufficient, however, essential, because
mental purification can only be achieved through the cultivation of ethical conduct.
The importance of speech in the context of Buddhist ethics is obvious: words can
break or save lives, make enemies or friends, start war or create peace. Buddha
explained right speech as follows: 1. to abstain from false speech, especially
not to tell deliberate lies and not to speak deceitfully, 2. to abstain from
slanderous speech and not to use words maliciously against others, 3. to
abstain from harsh words that offend or hurt others, and 4. to abstain from
idle chatter that lacks purpose or depth. Positively phrased, this means to
tell the truth, to speak friendly, warm, and gently and to talk only when
necessary.
<!--l. 54040--><p class="indent" >   4. Right Action
<!--l. 54042--><p class="indent" >   The second ethical principle, right action, involves the body as natural means of
expression, as it refers to deeds that involve bodily actions. Unwholesome actions
lead to unsound states of mind, while wholesome actions lead to sound states of
mind. Again, the principle is explained in terms of abstinence: right action means 1.
to abstain from harming sentient beings, especially to abstain from taking life
(including suicide) and doing harm intentionally or delinquently, 2. to abstain from
taking what is not given, which includes stealing, robbery, fraud, deceitfulness, and
dishonesty, and 3. to abstain from sexual misconduct. Positively formulated, right
action means to act kindly and compassionately, to be honest, to respect the
belongings of others, and to keep sexual relationships harmless to others. Further
details regarding the concrete meaning of right action can be found in the
Precepts.
<!--l. 54056--><p class="indent" >   5. Right Livelihood
<!--l. 54058--><p class="indent" >   Right livelihood means that one should earn one&#8217;s living in a righteous way and
that wealth should be gained legally and peacefully. The Buddha mentions four
specific activities that harm other beings and that one should avoid for this reason: 1.
dealing in weapons, 2. dealing in living beings (including raising animals for slaughter
as well as slave trade and prostitution), 3. working in meat production and butchery,
and 4. selling intoxicants and poisons, such as alcohol and drugs. Furthermore any
other occupation that would violate the principles of right speech and right action
should be avoided.
<!--l. 54068--><p class="indent" >   6. Right Effort
<!--l. 54070--><p class="indent" >   Right effort can be seen as a prerequisite for the other principles of the path.
Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing can be achieved,
whereas misguided effort distracts the mind from its task, and confusion will
be the consequence. Mental energy is the force behind right effort; it can
occur in either wholesome or unwholesome states. The same type of energy
that fuels desire, envy, aggression, and violence can on the other side fuel
self-discipline, honesty, benevolence, and kindness. Right effort is detailed in four
types of endeavours that rank in ascending order of perfection: 1. to prevent
the arising of unarisen unwholesome states, 2. to abandon unwholesome

states that have already arisen, 3. to arouse wholesome states that have
not yet arisen, and 4. to maintain and perfect wholesome states already
arisen.
<!--l. 54084--><p class="indent" >   7. Right Mindfulness
<!--l. 54086--><p class="indent" >   Right mindfulness is the controlled and perfected faculty of cognition. It is the
mental ability to see things as they are, with clear consciousness. Usually, the
cognitive process begins with an impression induced by perception, or by a thought,
but then it does not stay with the mere impression. Instead, we almost always
conceptualise sense impressions and thoughts immediately. We interpret them and set
them in relation to other thoughts and experiences, which naturally go beyond the
facticity of the original impression. The mind then posits concepts, joins concepts
into constructs, and weaves those constructs into complex interpretative schemes. All
this happens only half consciously, and as a result we often see things obscured. Right
mindfulness is anchored in clear perception and it penetrates impressions without
getting carried away. Right mindfulness enables us to be aware of the process of
conceptualisation in a way that we actively observe and control the way our thoughts
go. Buddha accounted for this as the four foundations of mindfulness: 1.
contemplation of the body, 2. contemplation of feeling (repulsive, attractive, or
neutral), 3. contemplation of the state of mind, and 4. contemplation of the
phenomena.
<!--l. 54105--><p class="indent" >   8. Right Concentration
<!--l. 54107--><p class="indent" >   The eighth principle of the path, right concentration, refers to the development of
a mental force that occurs in natural consciousness, although at a relatively low level
of intensity, namely concentration. Concentration in this context is described as
one-pointedness of mind, meaning a state where all mental faculties are unified and
directed onto one particular object. Right concentration for the purpose of
the eightfold path means wholesome concentration, i.e. concentration on
wholesome thoughts and actions. The Buddhist method of choice to develop
right concentration is through the practice of meditation. The meditating
mind focuses on a selected object. It first directs itself onto it, then sustains
concentration, and finally intensifies concentration step by step. Through this
practice it becomes natural to apply elevated levels concentration also in everyday
situations.

<!--l. 54169--><p class="indent" >   Introduction
<!--l. 54171--><p class="indent" >   The doctrine of kamma (karma &#8212; action) is one of the Buddha&#8217;s central
teachings. There is a modern myth that he simply picked up his ideas on kamma
from the worldview prevalent in his day, and that they aren&#8217;t really integral to his
message. Nothing could be further from the truth. Early Buddhists often cited the
Buddha&#8217;s teaching on kamma as one of the prime teachings that set him apart from
his contemporaries, and a study of his teachings on kamma will show that they
underlie everything else he taught.
<!--l. 54180--><p class="indent" >   The following readings from the Pali canon are designed to give an overview of
the Buddha&#8217;s teachings on kamma. Before tackling them, you might want to read a
few introductory articles on the topic, including the following ones available on
Access to Insight: "Karma," "A Refuge in Skillful Action" (contained in the book,
Refuge), and "Samsara Divided by Zero."
<!--l. 54187--><p class="indent" >   The readings here are divided into three main sections:
<!--l. 54189--><p class="indent" >   Non-Buddhist theories
<!--l. 54191--><p class="indent" >   Skillfulness
<!--l. 54193--><p class="indent" >   Kamma
<!--l. 54195--><p class="indent" >   The first section provides background for the Buddhist teachings on kamma by
showing how the early Buddhists viewed the way other contemporary schools of
thought explained kamma.
<!--l. 54199--><p class="indent" >   The second section focuses on the Buddha&#8217;s basic observation that underlay his
teachings on kamma: that it is possible to develop a skill. This simple fact carries a
number of important implications for any teaching on action. (1) Actions give results,
and their results follow a discernible pattern. Otherwise, it would not be
possible to develop a skill. (2) Some results are more desirable than others.
Otherwise, there would be no point in developing a skill. (3) By observing
one&#8217;s mistakes one may learn from them and use that knowledge to act
more skillfully in the future. This means that the mind is a crucial agent in
determining actions and their results, and there is an opening for feedback to
influence the process of action. It is thus a non-linear process, and there is
room for free will. (4) Results can be observed while one is acting, as well
as after the action is done. This means that actions have both immediate
results and long-term results, a fact that makes the non-linear process very
complex.

<!--l. 54215--><p class="indent" >   The passages in the second section discuss how these observations apply in
practice. §5 discusses how the Buddha applied the principle of skillfulness to reach
Awakening. §7 shows how to use it to decide what teachings are valid. §8
discusses how to apply it to all of one&#8217;s actions. The remaining passages are
self-explanatory.
<!--l. 54221--><p class="indent" >   The third section, on kamma, consists of passages that build a larger theory of
action based on these observations. These passages are divided into three
sub-sections, based on a classification given in §14:
<!--l. 54225--><p class="indent" >   Kamma &amp; Causes
<!--l. 54227--><p class="indent" >   Results
<!--l. 54229--><p class="indent" >   Diversity &amp; Cessation
<!--l. 54231--><p class="indent" >   Sub-section A is the most theoretical part of this study guide. It covers the
Buddha&#8217;s basic theory of causation (§15) and treats the place of intention &#8212; the
factor that the Buddha identified as the essence of kamma &#8212; in the context of the
Buddha&#8217;s analysis of physical and mental phenomena (name-&amp;-form). In the light of
the Buddha&#8217;s observation in §5 that views influence kamma (views come under
attention in the analysis of "name"), this sub-section concludes with two levels of
right view: mundane right view, which informs the sort of good kamma that brings
about happy results within the process of death and rebirth; and transcendent
right view, which informs the sort of kamma that brings freedom from that
process.
<!--l. 54244--><p class="indent" >   Sub-section B focuses on the issue of how long it takes for the results of kamma to
appear, and gives particular attention to some of the complexities that arise from the
fact that kamma is non-linear. Sometimes the results of an action don&#8217;t appear
immediately, or even in the immediate next life. §27 discusses the role that the mind
plays in determining how the results of kamma are experienced, and §28 treats the
intelligent way to use the Buddha&#8217;s teachings on kamma when reflecting on
one&#8217;s own past bad kamma so as to train oneself in the proper frame of
mind.
<!--l. 54254--><p class="indent" >   Sub-section C is divided into two further sub-sections, based on a classification in
§29:
<!--l. 54257--><p class="indent" >   Dark Kamma, Bright Kamma
<!--l. 54259--><p class="indent" >   Kamma Neither Dark nor Bright
<!--l. 54261--><p class="indent" >   The first of these two sub-sections discusses types of actions and mental qualities
that lead to good or bad results within the process of rebirth and death. In some
passages the emphasis is on results in the present life; in others, on results in future
lives. The second of these two sub-sections discusses the type of kamma &#8212; and the
right views underlying that kamma &#8212; leading to freedom: the cessation of
kamma, the realization of nibbana. The concluding passages make the point
that transcendent right view contains the seeds for its own transcendence:
once it has done its duty in cutting away other attachments, it creates the
momentum so that the mind can then abandon attachment to views of any
sort, right or wrong, mundane or transcendent. That is how true freedom is
gained.

guild, or of the royalty, if he is asked as a witness, &#8217;Come &amp; tell, good man, what you
know&#8217;: If he doesn&#8217;t know, he says, &#8217;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217; If he does know, he says, &#8217;I know.&#8217;
If he hasn&#8217;t seen, he says, &#8217;I haven&#8217;t seen.&#8217; If he has seen, he says, &#8217;I have seen.&#8217; Thus
he doesn&#8217;t consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another,
or for the sake of any reward. Abandoning false speech, he abstains from
false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no
deceiver of the world. Abandoning divisive speech, he abstains from divisive
speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people
apart from these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell
here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling
those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves
concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord.
Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He speaks words
that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart,
that are polite, appealing &amp; pleasing to people at large. Abandoning idle
chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is
factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, &amp; the Vinaya.
He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed,
connected with the goal. This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal
action.

be, neither would there be what is mine. I will not be, neither will there
be what is mine." This annihilationist view is a fabrication... Or... he may
be doubtful &amp; uncertain, having come to no conclusion with regard to the
true Dhamma. That doubt, uncertainty, &amp; coming-to-no-conclusion is a
fabrication.

person, touched by what is felt born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That
fabrication is born of that. And that fabrication is inconstant, fabricated,
dependently co-arisen. That craving... That feeling... That contact... That
ignorance is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. It is by knowing

consciousness goes on to merit. If he fabricates a demeritorious fabrication, his

consciousness goes on to demerit. If he fabricates an imperturbable fabrication, his
consciousness goes on to the imperturbable. When ignorance is abandoned by a
monk, clear knowing arises. From the fading of ignorance and the arising of
knowledge, he neither fabricates a meritorious fabrication nor a demeritorious
fabrication nor an imperturbable fabrication. Neither fabricating nor willing, he is
not sustained by anything in the world. Unsustained, he is not agitated.
Unagitated, he is totally unbound right within. He discerns that &#8217;Birth is
ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this

persuasions were staying. On arrival he greeted them courteously. After an exchange
of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the
wanderers said to him, "Tell us, householder, what views the contemplative Gotama
has.&#8217;

"As for the venerable one who says, &#8217;The cosmos is eternal. Only this is true;
anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have,&#8217; his view arises from
his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another. Now this
view has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen.

Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen,
that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. This venerable one thus adheres
to that very stress, submits himself to that very stress." (Similarly for the other

discerning that, he does not hold to that act of discernment. And as he is not holding
