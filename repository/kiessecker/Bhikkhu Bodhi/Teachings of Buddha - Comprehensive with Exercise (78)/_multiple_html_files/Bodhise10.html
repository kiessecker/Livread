<!--l. 43949--><p class="indent" >   On first encounter Buddhism confronts us as a paradox. Intellectually, it appears
a freethinker&#8217;s delight: sober, realistic, undogmatic, almost scientific in its outlook
and method. But if we come into contact with the living Dhamma from within, we
soon discover that it has another side which seems the antithesis of all our
rationalistic presuppositions. We still don&#8217;t meet rigid creeds or random speculation,
but we do come upon religious ideals of renunciation, contemplation and devotion; a
body of doctrines dealing with matters transcending sense perception and
thought; and &#8212; perhaps most disconcerting &#8212; a program of training in
which faith figures as a cardinal virtue, doubt as a hindrance, barrier and
fetter.
<!--l. 43961--><p class="indent" >   When we try to determine our own relationship with the Dhamma, eventually we
find ourselves challenged to make sense out of its two seemingly irreconcilable faces:
the empiricist face turned to the world, telling us to investigate and verify things for
ourselves, and the religious face turned to the Beyond, advising us to dispel our
doubts and place trust in the Teacher and his Teaching.
<!--l. 43968--><p class="indent" >   One way we can resolve this dilemma is by accepting only one face of the
Dhamma as authentic and rejecting the other as spurious or superfluous. Thus, with
traditional Buddhist pietism, we can embrace the religious side of faith and
devotion, but shy off from the hard-headed world-view and the task of critical
inquiry; or, with modern Buddhist apologetics, we can extol the Dhamma&#8217;s
empiricism and resemblance to science, but stumble embarrassingly over the
religious side. Yet reflection on what a genuine Buddhist spirituality truly
requires, makes it clear that both faces of the Dhamma are equally authentic
and that both must be taken into account. If we fail to do so, not only do
we risk adopting a lopsided view of the teaching, but our own involvement
with the Dhamma is likely to be hampered by partiality and conflicting
attitudes.
<!--l. 43982--><p class="indent" >   The problem remains, however, of bringing together the two faces of the Dhamma
without sidling into self-contradiction. The key, we suggest, to achieving this
reconciliation, and thus to securing the internal consistency of our own perspective
and practice, lies in considering two fundamental points: first, the guiding purpose of
the Dhamma; and second, the strategy it employs to achieve that purpose. The
purpose is the attainment of deliverance from suffering. The Dhamma does not aim
at providing us with factual information about the world, and thus, despite a
compatibility with science, its goals and concerns are necessarily different from those

of the latter. Primarily and essentially, the Dhamma is a path to spiritual
emancipation, to liberation from the round of repeated birth, death and suffering.
Offered to us as the irreplaceable means of deliverance, the Dhamma does not seek
mere intellectual assent, but commands a response that is bound to be fully religious.
It addresses us at the bedrock of our being, and there it awakens the faith,
devotion and commitment appropriate when the final goal of our existence is at
stake.
<!--l. 44000--><p class="indent" >   But for Buddhism faith and devotion are only spurs which impel us to enter and
persevere along the path; by themselves they cannot ensure deliverance. The primary
cause of bondage and suffering, the Buddha teaches, is ignorance regarding the true
nature of existence; hence in the Buddhist strategy of liberation the primary
instrument must be wisdom, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are.
Investigation and critical inquiry, cool and uncommitted, constitute the first step
toward wisdom, enabling us to resolve our doubts and gain a conceptual grasp of the
truths upon which our deliverance depends. But doubt and questioning cannot
continue indefinitely. Once we have decided that the Dhamma is to be our vehicle to
spiritual freedom, we have to step on board: we must leave our hesitancy behind
and enter the course of training which will lead us from faith to liberating
vision.
<!--l. 44015--><p class="indent" >   For those who approach the Dhamma in quest of intellectual or emotional
gratification, inevitably it will show two faces, and one will always remain a puzzle.
But if we are prepared to approach the Dhamma on its own terms, as the way to
release from suffering, there will not be two faces at all. Instead we will see what was
there from the start: the single face of Dhamma which, like any other face, presents
two complementary sides.
